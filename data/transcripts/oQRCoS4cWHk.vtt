00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so I'm still the same person who testified last week in front of this committee I'm representing Timothy Horrigan from Stratford County District 6 to towns of Durham and Madbury.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.500
I'm here to introduce HB 60FN relative to school lunches and establishing the Meals for Students Fund.

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.500
Those of you who have been on the committee, we've had similar bills in the past.

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Actually, it's something of a misnomer because it also deals with school breakfasts.

15
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
It makes basically two changes.

16
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:38.000
This is RSA 18911 11 a which deals with food and nutrition programs in public schools the first change in section one requires all schools provide both breakfast and lunch which I think many of them doing and that's I think that's been the subject of a think there's other bills I think there's at least one other bill bill which would make both breakfast like make breakfast universal, school breakfast universal in New Hampshire.

17
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.500
And that change would be permanent if you pass the bill as is.

18
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.500
And the second change is in sections 2 for 4.

19
00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:35.000
It's actually going to apply only to July 1st 2025 it's a little over three years that's the date is the beginning of this state's fy 2026 fiscal year it's also and it's also about when the current stimulus and covid relief federal funds would run out i certainly i certainly would hope this committee and our finance committee would revisit this issue in 2024 and do a more permanent thing, but this is just for the next budget cycle, the remainder of this budget cycle and then the next one.

20
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:50.500
So it reduced families' co-pay, reduced price meal from zero from the current, what I have here is 30 cents per day for breakfast and 40 cents per day for lunch.

21
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.000
The fiscal note seems to have different information on it, but the fiscal note is probably right.

22
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The existing distinction between free lunch and reduced price lunch families would stay in place along with all the procedures associated with that distinction.

23
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The key difference if this bill becomes law would be that the approximately 9,000 students in the reduced price category would, going forward, get free lunches and breakfasts.

24
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.500
And Section 4 of the bill is identical to existing law.

25
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:42.000
It's a somewhat convoluted way of changing the law for three years and then changing back to the way it is right now.

26
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And I certainly would be amenable to maybe not necessarily going back to the old law, but that's what this bill said.

27
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That seemed like the safest thing.

28
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The rationale for changing the law for just three years is basically, I may not know much about as many of the committee, but federal funding appears to be readily available through the Biden administration's economic stimulus and pandemic relief packages, and also the state budget is, rather ironically, after all the strange things that happened, the last two or three years actually is running a surplus at the moment.

29
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So a rainy day fund, for example, is, I think, something like $275 million, but anyway.

30
00:04:39.000 --> 00:05:46.500
And the federal funding, federal funding we go into a new meals for students fund this dedicated fund could actually receive money from any source not just from the federal government but also from the private sector or even from the state government itself and as I said if this no-cost school lunches and breakfast proves to be popular and feasible then the expansion you know could be this issue can be addressed during the uh 20 in 2025 during the 26-27 biennial budget process actually in theory we could probably even do it next year in 2023 we're doing the 2024-2025 budget so the fiscal note was accurate to me states this proposal would650,000 a year and directly benefit about 9,000 students, which, as I said, I'm confident that federal funding can be found.

31
00:05:46.500 --> 00:06:05.500
And even the absence of federal funding, I think this is a good and relatively inexpensive program, which is, well, spending even our own money on, much as we don't like to do that here in New Hampshire.

32
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.500
But I think it's worth it.

33
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.500
And so other states have gone much farther than this.

34
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:41.000
California and Maine are putting in programs to give free breakfasts and free school meals to every student in the public schools and the other schools that participate in the school nutrition program, which that actually would be like relatively be, that actually would be like relatively, not relatively, that would actually be surprisingly inexpensive.

35
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.500
But that's not what this bill does.

36
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.000
We're just addressing this piece of it.

37
00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:23.500
And also one more side benefit is schools are often having trouble getting parents to apply for the reduced price meals either because they, well, of course, many school districts, including the one in my community, have been doing free meals since the pandemic started just because for various reasons it's worth spending the money to give everyone a free meal whether they're like eligible for a subsidized meal or not.

38
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:30.500
But anyway, that's something that you probably want to look at in the future.

39
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.500
Maybe not this week.

40
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:42.500
So I think hopefully everyone will agree that if we can find the funding, the policy is a good one.

41
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:48.000
And so I hope you will find it out to pass.

42
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.500
So basically that's my testimony.

43
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.500
So thanks.

44
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.000
Thank you very much, Representative.

45
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Are there any questions?

46
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Yes, Representative Woodcock.

47
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Thank you, Chairman.

48
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:12.500
Representative Holken, I just want to make clear I understand we've had a couple of bills very similar to this in this session.

49
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:20.000
I want to make sure I understand the difference between this and the other two.

50
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Okay.

51
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Your bill would take, if I understand you correctly, would take the folks or youngsters who are on free or reduced lunch, make them a free lunch, and include the lunch which we haven't previously done.

52
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.500
So you're expanding this so there is no cost.

53
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:53.500
If my youngster was on a reduced meal schedule, this would now be eliminated just via zero fee.

54
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.500
Yes.

55
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:03.000
I guess it would still be classified as reduced lunch just because of all the...

56
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Right.

57
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Okay.

58
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I mean...

59
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I just want to make sure I was very clear.

60
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Thank you, Chairman.

61
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Thank you.

62
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Further questions?

63
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Representative Hill.

64
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Thank you, Mr.

65
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Chairman.

66
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.500
And thank you for your welcome to the committee.

67
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500
Appreciate your testimony, Representative.

68
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:55.500
I have a question about the last page of the fiscal fiscal note, and I'm wondering if you have a solution to the additional startup cost, labor cost, cost of meal pricing, projected participation, and actual participation for those 170 schools that they are concerned about.

69
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:08.000
I know the school district in my community has a real hard time with labor, and I'm wondering if that's something that you've thought of.

70
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.500
Well, I didn't write the fiscal note.

71
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:26.500
I mean, I did do my own back- the envelope calculations and it seemed to be correct insofar as, I mean, some of that's impossible to know with 100% certainty.

72
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:39.500
So that's, yeah, but there is a lot of labor involved with keeping the school cafeterias going regardless of whether or not we pass this bill.

73
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:45.000
I don't, so I think that's a problem they're faced with.

74
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:59.000
That's a problem they're faced with regardless of what we do with the bill and this bill would at least direct a few more dollars to the school.

75
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So that's Thank you.

76
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.500
You can bring something in from LBA.

77
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:14.500
LBA might be telling you more like why they, and education might be more detailed why they brought those numbers.

78
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.500
Thank you very much.

79
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.000
Are there additional questions from the committee?

80
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Not seeing any.

81
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Thank you very much.

82
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Thank you.

83
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.500
Are there any other folks in the group in front of us that would like to testify?

84
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.500
You came as a technical support.

85
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.500
Are there any questions from the department for technical support?

86
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.500
Not seeing any hands?

87
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:51.500
Yeah, could we just find out what the feasibility of implementation would be Sure.

88
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.500
McKenzie, could you come up please?

89
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.000
I know there's been some timing of questions before.

90
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Mackenzie, could you come up, please?

91
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I know there's been some timing.

92
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.500
You have a question from Representative Luno.

93
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:15.500
Thank you very much for joining us this morning and for taking the question.

94
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:23.000
I'm just interested in your thoughts regarding the effective date and implementation of this bill.

95
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.500
Thank you for the question.

96
00:12:25.500 --> 00:13:12.500
So if the bill is only intended to ensure that we are fully reimbursing reduced lunch students, so making up that gap, that 40 cents gap, to make reduced lunch students free for those participating in an slp that is something that could be implemented on a quicker timeline if the bill intends to expand lunch and breakfast provision requirements to those schools not participating in an slp at all which include about 54 public schools and about 140 private schools, then that would require significant startup time per our testimony on similar bills.

97
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:51.500
And the startup cost as estimated independently has been around $23,000 per school not providing any sort of school nutrition program whether that be breakfast or lunch the other piece to note again is that of the 466 schools participating in an SLP 30 of those do not participate in breakfast so there would be a lag potentially in time required to be able to provide breakfast in addition to lunch for those NSLP participants currently doing so.

98
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500
Thank you.

99
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.500
Representative Lycus, do you have a question for the department?

100
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:16.000
Yeah, it just occurred to me to wonder, and maybe either the sponsor or you could answer this, who is responsible then for all of the startup costs in starting those 30 schools doing lunch?

101
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And I know we can't know what that is because it all depends upon the individual school, but who would be responsible for paying for that so that that's not addressed in the proposal at the legislative proposal as we understand it so that would fall to the school district the school and local expenditures likely and that's why those are indeterminable.

102
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Right.

103
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Thank you.

104
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Thank you.

105
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.500
Are there further questions of the department?

106
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.500
Not seeing any.

107
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.500
Thank you very much.

108
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.500
With that, we're going to close this hearing.

109
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.500
We only had one pink card.

110
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:13.000
Did you have any people signing in on that, Representative Porter?

111
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Okay, that's your job.

112
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
I had the impression that you didn't want me to do it.

113
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Really?

114
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Yes.

115
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
But I will continue if you would like.

116
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Well, the only thing is the sign-up of positioning can go through the day.

117
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.500
So what we can put an indicator.

118
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.000
So with that, we're done this hearing.

119
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And what we're going to do right now, we're going to break into caucuses.

120
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
At least the Republicans are going to caucus.

121
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And from what I understand, Representative Luno had indicated he would like to do the same.

122
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:16.500
So what we're going to do is we're going to break for our caucus right now, and we will come back in how much time do you need, Dave?

123
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.000
What time would you like to start?

124
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Well, this hearing was, you know, scheduled just to start.

125
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.500
Of course, that can stop any time because it's a hearing.

126
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.500
So I'd like to, you know, take it.

127
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.500
Thank you.

128
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.000
This hearing was, you know, scheduled just to start.

129
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.500
Of course, that can stop any time because it's a hearing.

130
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:54.500
So I'd like to, you know, take a quarter of ten or ten of ten, thereabouts.

131
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.500
Yes, okay.

132
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.500
Okay, good.

133
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.500
I don't know if there's other rooms available.

134
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:08.000
Maybe just right across the hallway if there's nothing going on.

135
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Okay.

136
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Okay.

137
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Thank you very much.

138
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So with that, we're going to break into caucuses, and we'll come back at approximately 10 to 10.

139
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Thank you.

140
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Thank you.

141
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Thank you.

142
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Thank you.

143
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Thank you.

144
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Thank you.

145
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Thank you.

146
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Thank you.

147
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Thank you.

148
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Thank you.

149
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Thank you.

150
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Thank you.

151
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Thank you.

152
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Thank you.

153
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Thank you.

154
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.500
Okay, we're going to go ahead here.

200
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.000
We've just done some huddling up here.

201
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
We're going to try and move this thing and get out of here by 1 o'clock.

202
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:52.500
So, folks, if you know how you're going to go and approach that, let's just get there without a lot of discussion and try to wrap this thing up.

203
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.500
I think we can do it.

204
00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.000
Do you think we can do it, Representative Luno?

205
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.500
I think we can do it following our conversation.

206
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.500
Conversation, okay.

207
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:24.000
Okay, so with that, we're going to start right off with HB, and we're going to use the list that you have in front of you, Representative Luno, and I have in front of me.

208
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.500
HB 1574, I'm looking to Representative Moffittitt for a motion, please.

209
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.500
And we'll get to 1574 here.

210
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.500
Yeah, thank you, Mr.

211
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.500
Chair.

212
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:42.500
Yes, this is the measure on school tuition for art estate students.

213
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.500
Frankly, I move ITL.

214
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.500
That's correct.

215
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.000
We have a motion on the floor.

216
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Brief discussion, please, from either the maker or the second, and then if there's on the other side.

217
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Thank you, Mr.

218
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Chair.

219
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.500
Very briefly, I think this was, frankly, kind of a mischief bill that was submitted.

220
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:18.000
I think the intent of it was to shine a light on out-of-state students voting.

221
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.500
And I think it shined that light.

222
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:27.000
And I don't think it's a realistic, financially speaking, to OTP.

223
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
So I recommended ITL.

224
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
You're talking about that $130 million.

225
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.500
Okay, does the second have any discussion?

226
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.500
Nothing to add.

227
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.500
Thank you.

228
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.500
Thank you.

229
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.000
Is there any further discussion?

230
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Representative Luno?

231
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Thanks.

232
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.500
I think we're good with the motion being made.

233
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.500
Thank you.

234
00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:05.500
Madam Clerk, and this is right on the top side where Melissa's had to do the clerking, so please bear with us.

235
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.500
So learning experience.

236
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.000
I thought we were moving this along.

237
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
All right.

238
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
All right.

239
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Rep.

240
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Bone.

241
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Yes.

242
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Melissa, Rep.

243
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Litchfield, the clerk.

244
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Excuse me.

245
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Can we teach you a moment?

246
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:46.500
You've got to say the bill number and or i can do that too either one so um and the motion that's correct no no no so basically i'll help you right out.

247
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.500
It's 1574.

248
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.500
If I get to it here.

249
00:22:51.500 --> 00:23:03.500
It's an act prohibiting the university system and community college systems of New Hampshire from charging out-of-state tuition to students voting in New Hampshire.

250
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:09.000
Okay, and this is HB 1574 with a motion of ITL.

251
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Representative Boehm.

252

Chair.

291
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.000
I recommend HB 1648, inexpedient to legislate for the reason, although...

292
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Not right now.

293
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
We've got to get a second on the floor, please.

294
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Rep.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.500

300
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.500
Thank you, Mr.

301
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.500
Chair.

302
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:56.500
yes I I recommend this bill the ITL because these types of programs are organically happening on the college campus and there is no need to mandate is there any further discussion, Representative Porter?

303
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.500
Thank you, Mr.

304
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:17.500
Chair, and I appreciate the ITL motion and understand why, but I do have a concern that the young people who brought this forward had a difficult time finding the services they needed at the community college level.

305
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:33.000
So I'm more likely to ask for an interim study on this bill so that we can maybe find a common ground that meets all the needs that people are finding.

306
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Thank you.

307
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Any further discussion?

308
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Yes, Representative Cornell.

309
00:26:39.000 --> 00:27:18.500
Yes, I plan on voting ITL, but just because I think it's a great idea, but i think there's too much in it and it encompasses too many different things for too many different places and i'd like to see it broken up a little bit more and it needs more work so i will vote itl but it's just too big further discussion not seeing hands uh reps of uh litchfield The motion is ITL for HB 1648.

310
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:29.500
It's a bill requiring public colleges and universities to implement peer support groups and develop policies for students with mental health conditions.

Thank you very much.

341
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:46.500
Next bill we have on the docket is HB 1685.

342
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:55.000
This is a bill establishing a school facility planning and development program in the Department of Education.

343
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.500
I recognize Representative Boehm for a motion.

344
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.500
Okay, Representative Ford, there's a second.

347
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.000
Oh, it's the school planning.

348
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.500
It's the school planning, remember?

349
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.500
Oh.

350
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:30.000
They couldn't define really the amount of money and all that.

351
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Okay.

352
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Yeah.

353
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000

354
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000

Yeah.

361
00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:10.000
That's – we've – this is all part of we've got building aid stuff coming in, and I think this is necessary after we come up with what we want to do with building aid and all that.

362
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
So this is premature.

363
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
And the criteria.

364
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Okay.

365
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000

Okay.

436
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.500
Sorry.

437
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.000
She said 18, and I think we're missing one.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Thank you.

439
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
You're objecting?

440
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.500

441
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.500
Is that correct?

442
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500
Okay, thank you.

446
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.000
Okay, thank you very much.

447
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.500
So that bill is ITL'd and put on consent.

448
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.500
The next bill we have is HB 1676.

449
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:45.000
That's relative to making incentive grants for school districts that improve in certain assessment scores.

450
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Recognize Representative Moffitt for a motion.

451
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Yes, thank you, Mr.

452
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Chair.

453
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I was the prime on this, as you will call for me.

454
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Oh, motion, interim study.

455
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Thank you very much.

456
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
And Representative Boehm.

457
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Second.

458
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Second.

459
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
We'll let the prime speak now.

460
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Thank you, Mr.

461
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Chair.

462
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I was the prime on this.

463
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.500
I obviously believe in the concept and support this.

464
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.500
And the language is from DOE.

465
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:52.500
Several of us did meet with the Commission and several other folks there were a couple of pieces of this that need a little tweaking I guess so ergo therefore the interim study recommendation any further discussion on this bill just a note that the money for it comes from the rainy day fund.

466
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.000
There's some questions on that.

467
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:10.500
The concept is a wonderful concept, but when we're talking about various funding mechanisms, we're talking about accountability as well, and some of that will come right into play in accountability.

468
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:17.000
So no further discussion on that, so let's call the motion on that.

469
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.500
It's relative to making incentive grants for school districts that improve in certain assessment scores.

470
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.500
It's HB 1676 FN.

471
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.000
And the motion is to interim study.

472
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Madam Clerk.

473
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000

Going on to the next bill, which we have on docket this morning.

530
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.500
Doing a good job, folks.

531
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.000
HB 1561, this is relative to school nutrition standards.

532
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:59.000
I recognize Representative Lakers for a motion I would like to make a motion to ITL.

533
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And Representative Boehm for a second.

534
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.500
Representative Lakers, do you have any discussion?

535
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:11.500
Just a real quick comment from all of the testimony we got.

536
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.000
This is already being done.

537
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.500
Further discussion from the second?

538
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.500
Oh, wait a minute.

539
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.500
Wrong bill.

540
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.500
That's what I thought.

541
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.500
This is dealing with nutrition requirements.

542
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:32.500
Yeah, I'm doing two that are similar, and yeah, I pulled the wrong one.

543
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.500
Okay, so this bill clearly has some problems.

544
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.000
It's not really ready for prime time.

545
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:58.000
We talked about interim study and decided instead we would just ITL and request that the prime kind of go back to the drawing board and do a little more research and come back next year.

546
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Further discussion?

547
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
I agree.

548
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.500
One of the, I like to offer just a little discussion.

549
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:14.500
Remember, this is a bill that had Tier 1 and Tier 2 Thank you.

550
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.500
Further discussion?

551
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.500
I agree.

552
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:24.000
One of the, I like to offer just a little discussion.

553
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:40.500
Remember, this is a bill that had Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers, and Tier 1 got a little better deal on the selling of the products or what they got for it.

554
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:47.500
And Tier 2, my concern was I come from an agricultural community, being Haverhill.

555
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.000
We Hatchland Dairy which is ship's milk all over.

556
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Isn't this the tier two bill?

557
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
1561?

558
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
This is the whole grains bill.

559
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
This is the whole grains and all that.

560
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.500
The whole grains and sugar.

561
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.500
Sodium and all that.

562
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.500
Oh, I see Target.

563
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.500
I've got to get new glasses.

564
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.500
I saw Target 3.

565
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.500
That's the other bill.

566
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:22.500
I did the same thing as you did, Representative Lakers.

567
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.000
It got me going the wrong way.

568
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.500
Oh, yeah, it's about the whole grains that students sometimes don't really enjoy.

569
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.500
We need more coffee here, I think, Rep.

570
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.500
Ladd.

571
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.000
Compared to the Wonder Bread.

572
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Any further discussion on this bill?

573
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Yes, Representative Walts.

574
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.500
I'm going to vote against ITL because I just think this is an important issue.

575
00:40:53.500 --> 00:41:01.500
I think school nutrition is a really important issue, and I know it's not going anywhere.

576
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:24.500
It sounds like it's really better for interim study than ITL, and I prefer interim study, so I'm going to vote against it, but I'm not going to be here to study it, so it's not necessarily fair for me to do that to you guys.

577
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.000
Thank you very much for that courtesy.

578
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:40.000
We do have some bills, but you've got the interim study, and I say several of those biggies are like school finance, budgeting, accountability.

579
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
The list goes on, and it's election year as well.

580
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
So for time for interim studies.

581
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Thank you very much.

582
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
A gal from Rochester.

583
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
I came there too.

584
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Just a comment.

585
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.500
Interim study or ITL, it doesn't matter.

586
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:05.000
You can still make changes and submit a bill next year.

587
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:12.500
The only thing, interim study is a committee that says they approve it or not.

588
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:18.000
But you can still come up with another bill next year.

589
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Thank you very much.

590
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Any further discussion?

591
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.500
So we have a motion on the floor for ITL on HB 1561.

592
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:34.000
The bill is a bill that relative to school nutrition standards.

593
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Representative Litchfield?

594
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Representative Boehm.

595
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Yes.

596
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Representative Hill.

597
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Yes.

598
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Representative Litchfield is yes.

599
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Representative Lakers.

600
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Yes.

601
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Representative Moffat.

602

Yes.

603

Yes.

605
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Representative Ford.

606
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Yes.

607
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Representative Soty.

608
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Yes.

609
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Representative Nelson.

610
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Yes.

611
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Representative Luno.

Representative Waltz.

620
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
No.

621
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Representative Cornell.

622
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Yes.

623
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Representative Tanner.

624
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Yes.

625
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Representative Walner.

626
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Yes.

627
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Representative Mullen.

628
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Yes.

629
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Representative Porter.

630
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Yes.

631
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Representative Hall.

632
00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Yes Hall and representative Ladd yes so the vote for ITL is 17 years in one day representative Waltz do you have any objection to putting on consent thank you very much so we'll put that on consent as well the next bill which we have is HB 1630 yes Thank you.

633
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.500
We're on 1630 right now.

634
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.000
For the awards to philosophy.

635
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
so I'd like to recognize Representative Saudi for a recommendation.

636
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Yes, thank you, Mr.

637
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Chair.

638
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
The motion is to interim study.

639
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Representative Lakers?

640
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
I second.

641
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
For the maker of the motion, is there any discussion?

642
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:57.000
I feel that this needs to be further looked into to see if we could get Socrates off of life support and back into the classroom.

643
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.500
Is there any further discussion?

644
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.500
Representative Tanner.

645
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:13.000
I think we just need to be really careful about putting too much into the curriculum, too much on the credits for graduation.

646
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:25.000
It's something as a teacher in school, that was one of the things you looked to this committee and said, oh, no, not again.

647
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:34.000
So I would agree with the interim study, but I want you to keep that in mind, please.

648
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.500
And I'll make one quick comment, too.

649
00:45:37.500 --> 00:46:38.000
Remember, that is the represent Mullen you sit down in Bedford there did the junior great books program and how to think and and using the thinking type questions when our interpretations the session going beyond just factual and understanding the meaning of what you're looking at and able to get different opinions and it's just a shared inquiry it's a wonderful approach that's integrated into elementary and middle school teaching I feel this an excellent way to get a lot of how you think the rhetoric and the logic that we've been should be accompanying everything we do into curriculum and my feeling is this should transpire and take effect all the way through and be meshed into current curriculum.

650
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:48.000
And I agree that we have a curriculum that's getting on tilt here, and we're throwing more at the schools.

651
00:46:48.000 --> 00:47:30.500
Days are not being extended, so something gets left out that's hopefully it's not a reading writing and arithmetic so I will be supporting the motion also any further discussion okay madam clerk we have a motion on the interim study requiring eight 1630 requiring high school students to complete a half-year required course and the introduction to philosophy would you please call the roll representative bohm yes representative hill yes representative litchfield is a yes representative lakas yes representative moffitt yes representative hobs Hobson.

Representative Luno.

660
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.500
Yes.

661
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.500

Representative Mullen.

Representative Porter.

676
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.500
Representative Tanner.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.500
Yes.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.500
Representative Wallner.

679
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.500
Yes.

680
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.500
Representative Mullen.

681
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.500
Yes.

682
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.500
Representative Porter.

683
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.500
Yes.

684
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.500
Representative Hall.

685
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.500
Yes.

686
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.500
And Representative Ladd.

687
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.500
Yes.

688
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.000
So for an interim study on 16-18-0.

689
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.500
So we will put that on consent as well.

690
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.500
Any objections?

691
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.500
Not seeing any objections.

692
00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.500
Thank you.

693
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.500
The next bill we're dealing with is 16-27.

694
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:10.500
This bill establishes an education freedom account program administrator position in the Department of Education and making an appropriation therefore.

695
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.000
I recognize Representative Boehm for a motion.

696
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Make a motion on 1627 to be ought to pass.

697
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
And Representative Hobson?

698
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Thank you very much.

699
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Representative Boehm, any discussion?

700
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Yes, I think this is definitely needed with the number of students hopefully going at the EFA, and I think it needs the Department of Education, somebody there to monitor it and run it.

701
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Further discussion?

702
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Yes, Rep.

703
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000

Chair.

706
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:56.500
Yeah, I'm going to support the EFA administrator.

707
00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:10.000
I think we did hear, actually, I certainly heard from a couple of DOE directors the necessity of this position being filled to service the EFA program.

708
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:24.500
But I also hope this administrator will also be able to collect, compile, and provide this committee with detailed information, certainly statistical information, with regards to the EFA program.

709
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.500
Is there further discussion?

710
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.500
Yes, Representative Woodcock.

711
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.500
Thank you, Mr.

712
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.500
Chairman.

713
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.500
Back just in time.

714
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:46.500
My concern is that as we bring this bill forward, we have another hue and cry and need there that's sitting unfilled by DOE.

715
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.500
We have the nursing director's position.

716
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:58.000
I can't think of a more critical time in our medical history in schools than that position.

717
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.500
And that's not being filled.

718
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:11.000
And as I understand, if you build on it filled, the money just stands there and we develop a little pool.

719
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.500
I'm not worried about the pool of money that DOE is maintaining for not filling the positions.

720
00:51:19.500 --> 00:52:01.500
What I'm objecting to is the fact that we have another position that they're going to fill, albeit it may be necessary, but surely the nursing position as equally as critical and i'm just upset that once again do we are not going through the only things they pick and choose and uh so therefore i will not be supporting that further than what thank you further discussion not seeing any hands so madam clerk we will uh we have a motion the floor.

721
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:14.000
Would you please call the roll on HB 1627, establishing an education freedom account program administrator in the Department of Education and making an appropriation.

722
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Therefore.

723
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000

Representative.

761
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Yes.

762
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Representative.

763
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000

Yes.

765
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Representative.

766
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Yes.

767
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Yes.

768
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Yes.

769
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Yes.

770
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Yes?

771
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Yes.

772
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
So that is 18 to 1.

773
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Any objections to consent?

774
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Not seen.

775
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000

777
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Thank you.

778
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.500
This is the one I was talking about before.

779
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.500
I move ITL on this one.

780
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.500
Second.

781
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:24.000
Yeah, according to the testimony, we heard this is already being done, so it's unnecessary.

782
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Thank you.

783
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:36.000
just once again this is another bill that we have that's, you know, an overload on curriculum and totally unneeded.

784
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Thank you.

785
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Thank you very much.

786
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:48.500
This is a bill dealing with a natural immunity system health and wellness curriculum in the school?

787
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.500
Representative Boehm?

788
00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.500
Yes.

Representative Litchfield is yes.

792
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.500
Representative Lakers?

793
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.500
Yes.

794
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.500
Representative Moffitt?

795
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.500
Yes.

796
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.500
Representative Hobson?

797
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.500
Yes.

798
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.500
Representative Ford?

799
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.500
Yes.

800
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.500
Representative Soty?

801
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.500
Yes.

802
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.500
Representative Nelson?

803
00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.500
Yes.

804
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.500
Representative Luno?

805
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.500
Yes.

806
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.500
Representative Waltz.

807
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.500
Yes.

808
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.500
Representative Nelson.

809
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.500
Yes.

810
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.500
Representative Luno.

811
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.500
Yes.

812
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.500
Representative Waltz.

813
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.500
Yes.

814
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.500
Representative Cornell.

815
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.500
Yes.

816
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.500
Representative Tanner.

817
00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.500
Yes.

818
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.500
Representative Walner.

819
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.500
Yes.

820
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.500
Representative Mullen.

821
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.500
Yes.

822
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.500
Representative Woodcock.

823
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.500
Yes.

824
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.500
Representative Porter.

825
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.500
Yes.

826
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:13.500
Representative Hall yes and Representative Ladd Yes Representative Woodcock is that your principal voice?

827
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:17.500
Thank you What was that final vote please?

828

19 to 0 Thank you Consent?

829
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.500
Objections?

830
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.500
Thank you We will do that.

831
00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.500
Thank you, Mr.

832
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.500
Chair.

833
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:35.000
I move that we find House Bill 1311 ought to pass.

834
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Second.

835
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Thank you.

836
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Before we continue, Mr.

837
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Chair, I want to spice things up a little bit.

838
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.500
I have an amendment to this bill.

839
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.500
Would you so introduce your amendment?

840
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.500
I would.

841
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.500
It is 2022 0201H.

842
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.500
Is there a second for that?

843
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.500
Okay.

844
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:08.500
Representative Luno, Madam Clerk can get that down, so it's a different right here.

845
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.000
So the amendment is 0201H.

846
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.500
Motion on the amendment made by Representative Mullen and second by Representative Mullen.

847
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.500
There are copies of the amendment being circulated.

848
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.000
Representative Luna was the second.

849
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:32.000
And copies are coming around, and we'll discuss that when everybody has a copy of this.

850
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
I can see that.

851
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.500
It looks like there's six holes or five holes.

852
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:43.500
I've been accused of being an overachiever in the past.

853
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:49.000
Well, I think that comes from breathing the air in Bedford.

854
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
No, I would agree with them.

855
00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:02.500
Well, if you taught the junior grade books, you're a thinker, and you're just thinking maybe five are better than three.

856
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:14.500
Exactly, and now I'm going to ask what people see when they look at the holes, and that will give me loads of information.

857
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.500
Share the query.

858
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.500
I love it.

859
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.500
Okay, everybody has your amendment now.

860
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.000
Can you please explain it?

861
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Yes.

862
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:47.000
When we met last week and we dealt with House Bill 1311 and House Bill 1234, I made reference to the fact that RSA 189.13a is the RSA that prevents employment in a school system by anything on the Section 5 offenses.

863
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:56.000
At that time, we were also considering RSA 189.13C, which are the Section 5 offenses that prevent credentialing.

864
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Two different things, two different sections.

865
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000
The new section, Section C, created by Senate Bill 134 last year.

866
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:17.500
At that time, it was Representative Cordelli who actually said or asked the question, why are we not considering Section A and Section C concurrently?

867
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:21.500
Why are we doing it in two steps?

868
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:32.500
We talked a little bit with Attorney Fenton about the aspect of amending the bill to include Section A and Section C.

869
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:36.000
So the amendment before you does that.

870
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:49.500
It adds possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell and felony assault to the list of Section 5, 189.13C offenses that would prevent credentialing.

871
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.500
Thank you.

872
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.500
That parallels our discussion we had.

873
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.000
Is there any further discussion on this?

874
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Yes, Representative Bohm?

875
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:17.500
Yes, I'd like to concur because one of the problems we have is what we've heard is a lot of people come to New Hampshire to credential and then don't even work in New Hampshire.

876
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:23.500
So this will prevent credentialing if they have been convicted of this.

877
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.500
Yeah.

878
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.500
Representative Woodcock.

879
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.500
Thank you.

880
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.500
Representative Maugham, how far does this go back?

881
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500
Is this retroactive?

882
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
Is this current?

883
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
How does this work?

884
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:48.000
That question actually was asked of Attorney Fenton when she was in the hot seat last week.

885
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.500
And it is not retroactive.

886
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:57.500
So it would go into effect from the effective date should it become law.

887
01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500
Thank you.

Chair, that House Bill 1311 be found ought to pass as amended.

Is there any further discussion on the OTPA?

951
01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.500
Mr.

952
01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:49.000
Chair, could we clarify who made the second, please?

953
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.500
The second was made by Representative Boehm.

954
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500
Thank you.

955
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.500
If you need more time, Madam Clerk, just tell us.

956
01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.500
Barbara Shaw was very vocal in that sometimes.

957
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:11.500
She'd tell us to hold that up and slow down and let me get things together.

958

Representative Porter.

965

966
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000

So ought to pass with Amendment 19 to 0.

971
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:29.000
Any problems with putting on the consent?

972
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Everybody agreeable?

973
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Thank you very much.

974
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
The next bill which we have is 1234, HB 1234.

975
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.000
This is a bill relative to criminal background checks for an applicant for a teaching credential.

976
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And I recognize Representative Mullen for a motion.

977
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Thank you, Mr.

978
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Chair.

979
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.500
House Bill 1234 adds human trafficking to RSA 18913, Section C.

980
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:08.500
much in the same way we're a little bit the cart before the horse, horse before the cart.

981
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:17.500
This would prevent anyone who had been found guilty of human trafficking from being credentialed in New Hampshire.

982
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.500
Yeah, okay.

983
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:24.000
So I move that it is ought to pass.

984
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Thank you very much.

985
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.500
And Representative Likas, is there a second?

986
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.500
Sure is.

987
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.500
I second.

988
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.500

989
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:39.500

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.500

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.500

So any further discussion from committee members?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Not seeing any discussion, Madam Clerk.

997
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500
Thank you very much.

1000
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah, any objections to consent?

1001
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Not seen.

1002
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
It's on consent.

1003
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.500
The next bill which we're dealing with is 1243.

1004
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.500
Yeah, I know.

1005
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:24.000
I'm just trying to get my of students for public schools.

1006
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'd like to recognize Representative Boehm for a motion, please.

1007
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I make a motion of 1243 of ITL in expedient to legislate.

1008
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And Representative Hobson.

1009
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
That would be me.

1010
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Second, please.

1011
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Thank you very much.

1012
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.500
Representative Boehm, do any discussion?

1013
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:59.500
Yeah, we heard from the Department of Safety of all kinds of problems with this, including liability issues, including liability issues for the drivers that are doing this.

1014
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:04.000
If the school says, okay, you can do this.

1015
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.500
We know this is going on anyway.

1016
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:15.500
Drive other students and parents drive other students, but it's not for the school doing it.

1017
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:30.000
So this would allow the school to say, yes, you can drive those others, and that puts a liability issue not only on driver but also on the school.

1018
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
So ITL.

1019
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Is there a further discussion from the committee?

1020
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:44.500
We also heard, of course, from the Department of Safety on this, from the officer that appeared.

1021
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:47.000
Not seeing any further discussion.

1022
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll.

1023
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000
On HB 1243, relative to alternative transportation of students for public schools.

1024
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Representative Boehm.

1025
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Yes.

1026
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Representative Ford.

1027
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000

Representative Soty.

1029
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yes.

1030
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Representative Nelson.

1031
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Yes.

1032
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Representative Luno.

1033
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Yes.

1034
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Representative Waltz.

1035
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:43.000
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes This any objection to consent not see any words on consent next bill we have is HB 1058 1058 is relative to the time allowed for public school students to eat lunch.

1036
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Mr.

1037
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Chairman, I move ITL.

1038
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Thank you very much.

1039
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Representative Likas.

1040
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I second.

1041
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Second.

1042
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.500
Is there any discussion from Representative Nelson?

1043
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:04.000
Yes, it's really an ideal bill, but here's a big but.

1044
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:45.000
As a former principal and a a teacher I see problems with it working especially in a larger school you either have to extend the days or you're going to have to do something that I don't think is ideal and I think we should leave the scheduling to a local administrator thank you very much is there further discussion I concur it's something that can be decided at the local level, working with your school administration and staff in that school.

1045
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Yes, Representative Walz.

1046
01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:03.500
So I agree that the schedule proposed in here is not workable, limiting it from 11 to 1, but I really like the idea of making sure kids get 20 minutes to eat.

1047
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:15.000
Because I've actually heard this way back to when my kids were in school about they didn't have enough time to eat lunch.

1048
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:25.500
And I think there's something to be said for assuring that kids have enough time to eat in a healthy fashion.

1049
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:50.000
So I will vote for ITL on this, but I would encourage this committee to in the future pass something or attach something in the form of an amendment that makes sure kids do have 20 minutes to eat, which I don't think is an excessive amount of time.

1050
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Thank you very much.

1051
01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:26.500

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.500
Consent okay?

1062
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.500
Got it?

1063
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.500
Okay.

1064
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.500
Next bill is 1144.

1065
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:57.000
This bill requires public schools to teach labor history.

1066
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.500
I recognize represent Ford for a motion.

1067
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.500
As what?

1068
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:06.500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1069
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.500
You're going the other way, bud.

1070
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.500
Okay, thank you.

1071
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.000
So the motion is ITL.

1072
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.500
Is there a second that comes from Representative Soty?

1073
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.500
Thank you.

1074
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.500
Discussion?

1075
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:37.000
I believe that this is a curriculum issue and that it's probably already being covered within the courses and the instructors' purview in terms of getting the curriculum approved.

1076
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.500
It would include this material.

1077
01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.000
Further discussion from the second?

1078
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.500
Representative Woodcock, then Representative Tanner.

1079
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.500
Thank you, Mr.

1080
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.500
Chairman.

1081
01:14:48.500 --> 01:15:05.500
I'd just like to make a comment once again that like Representative Nelson's leaving local scheduling to local school districts, curriculum instruction should be left at the local level and not done in Concord.

1082
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500
Thank you.

1083
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.000
It says it's statutory, too.

1084
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.500
That's how we have it.

1085
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.500
It's a local issue.

1086
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.500
Representative Tanner.

1087
01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:27.000
Just to add to that, that I think this is important, just like some of the other issues that we've had.

1088
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.500
But, again, it's burdensome on the local school district, and it's a local control issue.

1089
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.500
Thank you.

1090
01:15:36.500 --> 01:16:00.000
And I don't think we want to be getting down in the weeds to in all aspects of our curriculum so with that madam clerk would you please call the roll on HB 1144 the motion is ITL requiring public schools to teach labor history Representative Boehm?

1091
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Yes.

1092
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Representative Hill?

1093
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Yes.

1094
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.500
Representative Litchfield is a yes representative Lakers yes yes yes Yes.

1095
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.500
Representative Soty.

1096
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.500
Yes.

1097
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500
Representative Nelson.

1098
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.500
Yes.

1099
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.500
Representative Luno.

1100
01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.500
Yes.

1101
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.500
Representative Waltz.

1102
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.500
Yes.

1103
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.500
Representative Cornell.

1104
01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.500
Yes.

1105
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.500
Representative Tanner.

1106
01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.500
Yes.

1107
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.500
Representative Walner.

1108
01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.500
Yes.

1109
01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500
Representative Mullen.

1110
01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500
Yes.

1111
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
Representative Woodcock.

1112
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500
Yes.

1113
01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.500
Representative Porter.

1114
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.500
Yes.

1115
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500
Representative Hall.

1116
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.500
Yes.

1117
01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500
Representative Ladd?

1118
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500
Yes.

1119
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500
This is ITL 19-0.

1120
01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
Any objection to consent?

1121
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500
Not seeing it.

1122
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500
We'll put on consent.

1123
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:13.000
We have two bills left here this afternoon, or this morning.

1124
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
This morning.

1125
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
It's great.

1126
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It's a good thing because I only had two papers.

1127
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Two papers left?

1128
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Wonderful.

1129
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.500
The whole I gave you.

1130
01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.500
Okay, the next bill is 1632.

1131
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:38.000
This is relative to civil rights education in public elementary and secondary schools.

1132
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.500
I recognize Representative Lakers for a motion.

1133
01:17:41.500 --> 01:18:16.000
I would like to move interim study Hobson you have a second I have a second thank you very much represent Lakers you have any discussion yes this this actually talks about instruction which is up to school districts however it is a important topic, and we do need to make sure that it actually is being taught, so that would be the interim study as opposed to ITL.

1134
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Further discussion?

1135
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Representative Tanner?

1136
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Yes, I think we need to be consistent on these.

1137
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.500
that, you know, yes, civil rights, labor ed, philosophy, they're all very important.

1138
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:40.000
But curriculum belongs at the local level, and schools are already up to their ears in requirements.

1139
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And this just adds one more.

1140
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:52.000
So I will be voting against the interim study, voting hopefully to bring forth a motion for ITL.

1141
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Thank you.

1142
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Thank you.

1143
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Further, yes, Representative Woodcock.

1144
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Thank you, Mr.

1145
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Chairman.

1146
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:17.500
I would support Representative Tanner's position and comments and once again identify that this is not our business instructing, giving instruction to the local school board on what they should do.

1147
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:26.500
And I would yield to Representative Fuhrer, who was here before, the Executive Director of the secondary schools.

1148
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:30.000
He said the teachers' tanks are empty.

1149
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.500
The school district administrator's tanks are empty.

1150
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.500
We cannot continue to add on.

1151
01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.500
Thank you.

1152
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.500
Thank you.

1153
01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:44.500
Representative Porter, did you have your hand up?

1154
01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.000
I did have my hand up, Mr.

1155
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:56.500
Chair, and I was going to say the same things that Representative Tanner and Representative Woodcock said.

1156
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.500
Is there further discussion?

1157
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.500
Not seeing any.

1158
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:04.500
Representative Litchfield, would you please call the roll?

1159
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:17.000

Representative Moffitt.

1166
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Yes.

1167
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Representative Hobson.

1168
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Yes.

1169

Nelson.

1176

Yes.

1177

Representative Luno.

1178
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
No.

1179
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Representative Waltz.

1180
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000

1181

Representative Cornell.

1182
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
No.

1183

No.

1185
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
No.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
No.

1189
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Representative Walner?

1190
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
No.

1191
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Representative Mullin?

1192
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
No.

1193
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Representative Woodcock?

1194
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
No.

1195
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Representative Porter?

1196
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
No.

1197
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Representative Hall?

1198
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000

And Representative Ladd?

1200
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Yes.

1201
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Okay.

1202
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So Bill 1632 for interim study.

1203
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
The vote is 10 to 9.

1204
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Thank you very much.

1205
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And we have one bill left.

1206
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It's HB 1125.

1207
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.500
Yeah, what you got to do is we have sheets there.

1208
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:27.500
They're probably most likely there'll be a minority report on that, I would would assume and so the sheet goes down to and your motion would be to ITL I'm assuming do you have the forms for them?

1209
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.000
We'll get that to you.

1210
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Okay.

1211
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Yeah.

1212
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.500
We were talking about that prior bill that we just finished.

1213
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
We're on 1125 now.

1214
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:45.000
1125 is relative to school emergency plans.

1215
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.500
And we have, Representative Hobson, are you prepared for a motion?

1216
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.000
I am looking for the amendment 0141.

1217
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.500
Okay, we have the amendment right here.

1218
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.000
This was, you know, discussed.

1219
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
We have extra copies right here.

1220
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And there's three holes in it we'll let everybody get a hold of this but but we need a motion on the bill itself.

1221
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
On the bill itself?

1222
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I'll pass.

1223
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Okay, I'll make a motion to OTP 1125.

1224
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.500
Okay, and is there a second from Representative Boehm?

1225
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500
Second.

1226
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:42.500
Okay, now we have discussion, and you would be introducing your amendment on behalf of Representative Cordelli, who is not here today, unable to be here.

1227
01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.500
Okay.

1228
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.500
Mr.

1229
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.500
Chair, I'm sorry.

1230
01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:52.500
I have not seen the amendment until now.

1231
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:56.000
Okay, so I'll speak to it then.

1232
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Okay, thank you.

1233
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Yes.

1234
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.500
As you all recall, that we had Homeland Security here to speak on this bill.

1235
01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:19.000
It's one where we've had in the past Homeland Security has digitized all the site emergency evacuation and plans of all school districts.

1236
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And the materials have always passed through DOE to them.

1237
01:24:24.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And there was, you know, initially when we did this several years back, there was concern about confidentiality of all materials which were going to homeland security at that time was director perry plumber who was the director of it now we're looking at those information being shipped directly to homeland security but having access and the amendment here changes so there's access to all plans shall be provided to the Department of Education seeing the Department of Education is accountable to make sure these plans are in and they have to have knowledge that Homeland Security has received and they also should have those plans available to themselves too.

1238
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:48.500
Amy Clark being the director over there so this this amendment was written with Homeland Security and Amy Clark at DOE who's in charge of building facilities and emergency matters and security within the schools so the new part is on line 9 and 10 adding in access to all plans shall be provided to the Department of Education.

1239
01:25:48.500 --> 01:26:07.000
We want to make sure that the DOE has access to plans which are sent directly to Homeland Security and can help Homeland Security in making sure those plans are delivered, having the accountability from the department.

1240
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Yes, Representative Mullen.

1241
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Thank you, Mr.

1242
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Chair.

1243
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.500
Did we not have discussion about changing the September 1 date?

1244
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:26.500
In the amendment, it says that these reports are due to Homeland Security by September 1.

1245
01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:41.000
And I think that Amy had suggested that we push it out to, I don't know, maybe October 1 or whatever to give – or the middle of October.

1246
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.500
We did have that discussion.

1247
01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.000
Representative Cordelli is not here.

1248
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.500
This is the amendment that – yes, Representative Lakers?

1249
01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:59.500
Yeah, we did discuss that, but then decided that schools really should have emergency plans when they start.

1250
01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.500
Okay.

1251
01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:18.000
The emergency plans are sent, and then if they're not updated, the school is responsible for notifying that it remains the same, so they don't have to send all that stuff in again.

1252
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.500
So once done, these things ought to be pretty much stable.

1253
01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500
Thank you.

1254
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.500
Yes, Representative Nelson.

1255
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:33.000
Will these plans be available to the public in some way?

1256
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.500
Some bad guy wants to find out.

1257
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.500
Could they get them from somewhere?

1258
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.500
No, they're not.

1259
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:50.500
And the initial reason why these plans, of course, obviously, we don't want them available to the public.

1260
01:27:50.500 --> 01:28:06.000
But they digitize these things so that if you have a sheriff responding or if you have a local police officer or a state trooper responding, they will see these plans.

1261
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:20.000
they will see the digitized map of the building access areas where various systems are located within the building like water and water shut off and all that.

1262
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.500
They'll see that in their screens in their car.

1263
01:28:24.500 --> 01:29:05.000
So when we had this initially done by Perry Plummer over there, they had a sergeant just tasked with this responsibility loan and they did all that at no cost to the schools at all digitizing these things really important stuff this is very important and and and the one loophole we have right now is we're not really collaborating or had the ability to collaborate between DOE and Homeland Security and that we are trying to do through this bill.

1264
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Yes, Representative Tanner.

1265
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.500
I think it also goes to emergency services and fire and emergency services.

1266
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.500
Exactly.

1267
01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.500
Yes.

1268
01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:21.000
Yeah, the ambulance service even has that.

1269
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:33.500
And they all have this in those vehicles, and that's exactly where we want to be in terms of being prepared for these bad situations.

1270
01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:37.500
So is there any further discussion on this?

1271
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.500
So did we introduce the amendment?

1272
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.500
I'm trying to recall.

1273
01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:50.500
No, I asked you if you would mind, because I had not seen it until now.

1274
01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:54.500
I was prepared to talk about the bill.

1275
01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.500
Okay, so we've introduced the bill.

1276
01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:05.000
So what we need to do is have this amendment introduced and make a motion.

1277
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.500
Yes, I would like to make a motion that we OTP the amendment.

1278
01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.500
Is that correct?

1279
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.500

1280
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.500

1281
01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500
Yes.

1282
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.000
Is there a second from Representative Boone?

1283
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Second.

1284
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.500

Well, we did it.

1342
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.500
On consent?

1343
01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.500
Yeah, on consent.

1344
01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.000
We made it through everything.

1345
01:33:51.000 --> 01:34:15.000
It's 1130, but I i'd like to remind everybody of the 102 bills we've now done 20 and and uh we have nine early bills done though which is good that leaves us um six to go on on the early bill side so um we're making progress.

1346
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
So, yes.

1347
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
So was everything except for 1632 on consent?

1348
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Yes.

1349
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Yes.

1350
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Excellent job.

1351
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

1352
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:42.000
We accomplished some things today, which is, I really appreciate everybody trying to keep the discussion down, and I know that education is known for discussion.

1353
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:57.000
However, I think we accomplished something today, and if we can get the type of votes where we come out all on the same page here, that's really a positive.

1354
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I agree with you, Representative Luno.

1355
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I appreciate everybody's help in doing that today.

1356
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:15.500
I know there was some compromise made on folks here, but I think we came out with the right answer on these bills.

1357
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.500
Great job.

1358
01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:21.000
We will pick this up again tomorrow.

1359
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:28.500
We have some hearings coming up, and the agenda keeps unfolding like that right through.

1360
01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:34.000
I will let you know regarding the issue with the legislation.

1361
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.000
It's like Thursday, the mask legislation, what's going on there.

1362
01:35:39.000 --> 01:36:31.000
The ruling is if you cannot fit folks into a room or if you're having a scheduling issue in terms of size, you can postpone, but you have to give up 24 hours notice on the postponement and so we're well within that timeframe I will be meeting with folks today try to get a better handle on that where we are working with chief of staff etc so I will let try to let everybody know by by dinner time tonight so but what we will be doing, though, if that is postponed, there will be a hole right there in our schedule.

1363
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:47.500
We will have the opportunity to address some of those other bills, the other 80 bills that we have to deal with, and we're going to try to get on top of that.

1364
01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:52.500
This is a huge task, and we'll get through it.

1365
01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.500
We'll get through it.

1366
01:36:54.500 --> 01:37:00.500
And we will be starting at 9 with the first two bills.

1367
01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:04.000
Yeah, because they're in the calendar already.

1368
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:11.500
And some people may say, well, I'm going to be down here at 9 o'clock.

1369
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:15.500
And they don't look again at this thing.

1370
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.500
And they show up.

1371
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:46.000
So we we'll take advantage if we do postpone those two bills we will exact in that time we will what exec on on thursday if we take those two bills off and have to postpone to trying to be announced that's what the general the process would be We're hearing that their finance room is busy.

1372
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.500
We've heard the general of the process would be.

1373
01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:54.500
We're hearing that their finance room is busy.

1374
01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.500
We've heard general court is busy.

1375
01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:03.000
And I want to make sure that we have proper security.

1376
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I want to make sure we have proper safety for all that are attending.

1377
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
And that's imperative.

1378
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:19.000
And it's just like a principal would do, right, Representative Woodcock and Representative Nelson?

1379
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Yes, usually.

1380
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Hopefully always.

1381
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:35.500
I just want to make sure anything that we're going to accept hasn't been something that we've talked about for amendments that we've worked on.

1382
01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.500
I will.

1383
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.500
I'll be in touch with you.

1384
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:43.500
I'll be in touch with you.

1385
01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:53.500
It comes to a point where we're going to have to start exacting some of these very difficult controversial bills.

1386
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:56.000
It's got to come up.

1387
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.500
There's no really easy bills.

1388
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:02.500
Yeah, there is in terms of our acting.

1389
01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.000
Every bill somebody's put some time into.

1390
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And so we want to be respectful in that regard.

1391
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.500
So I really appreciate what's happened today.

1392
01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:17.000
We're done for right now.

1393
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
People have 1 o'clock.

1394
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I got a 1.30.

1395
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.500
I got a percent in another meeting.

1396
01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:27.000
So thank you for coming.

1397
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Ripson Hobson.

1398
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Hi, thank you.

1399
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.500
I just wanted to look ahead to the calendar next week.

1400
01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:45.500
It looks as if there will be subcommittee meetings on Monday and potentially no education hearing on Tuesday.

1401
01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:48.500
Is that what I see correctly?

1402
01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.500
I will look.

1403
01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:53.000
I believe that is correct.

1404
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.500
We have hearings strung out throughout Wednesday the 2nd.

1405
01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:01.500
On the 3rd, we have hearings as well.

1406
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:05.500
And on the 4th, we also have hearings.

1407
01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:23.500
So that's why you got the Tuesday off, because we're working four days a week, in some cases for those that are on these subcommittees, it could be five days a week, and it has been.

1408
01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:38.000
We had two subcommittee work groups yesterday, one dealing with a four-year degree offered by the community college system, and the other was dealing with the foundational budget bill.

1409
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Those will continue for the next two Mondays.

1410
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
We'll continue.

1411
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:57.500
Also, I have added in on the Tuesday, the February 8th, you'll see in the calendar that we have one bill at 145, and then we stop.

1412
01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:07.000
I've set something up for 2.30 when inviting over the Commissioner of Agriculture and Marketing, et cetera, over here.

1413
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.500
Remember, we had a couple farm bills, which we wanted more information from the department.

1414
01:41:14.500 --> 01:42:34.500
So we will be doing that it will be a work session committee of the whole committee of the whole so I'm not saying you're on it you're not on it everybody's welcome in a committee the whole and we will be looking at that was one of the bills that I addressed today in a proper I guess when I was talking to your one tier two and there's the other bill agriculture in the classrooms that committee there may be some need for us to realign the structure of that committee the committee is made up of non legislators remember as you recall other organizations and there's issues regarding profit nonprofit and all that in on terms of these various groups so we want to get to the bottom line that commissioner jasper does have some uh thoughts on that so he'll share it with us so that's that will be on tuesday february 8th at 2 30.

1415
01:42:34.500 --> 01:43:00.000
