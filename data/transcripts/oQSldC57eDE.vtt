may i follow are you gonna are you gonna
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%

this 12th
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
and the reason i'm saying that is
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
because i've already made an appointment
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
with an orthopedist for the for late in
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
the afternoon on the 12th but that won't
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
make it home
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna if you're going to exact
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
late in the afternoon
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
well you can discuss that with your
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
caucus leader maybe you need to take
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
that day off and arrange for a
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
substitute maybe i need to discuss that
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
with my chair the way that the way this
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
the situation goes which bills are you
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
do you know which bills you're going to
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
do on april i do i cannot tell you that
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
the other piece of business that you
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
need to know about is that there are
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
senate hearings happening today
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
concurrent with the hearings that we're
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
holding here today
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
so there will be members of senate
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
energy and natural resources coming over
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
here and there will be members of our
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee going over there
 
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
so people will be coming going coming
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
and going all day long so don't be
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
alarmed when you see people get up and
 
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.269 align:start position:0%
alarmed when you see people get up and
leave

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
and with that preamble i think we're
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
ready to begin our work for the day so
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
i will open the public hearing on house
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 256
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
feasibility of replacing the site
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and i'll introduce
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
the bill's sponsor senator geiger
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
welcome senator
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the record
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
of senate energy and natural resources
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
and prime sponsor of
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 256.
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
prior to commencing the hearing you may
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
have see me passing out a document
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
that document is the report of the
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee that met over the summer
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
chaired by senator ward
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
to look at the issues relative to the
 
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.430 align:start position:0%
to look at the issues relative to the
sec

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
sec
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
the results of that were two pieces of
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
legislation one sponsored by
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative vos the second by myself
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
256 establishes a committee to study the
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
feasibility of replacing the site
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is necessary for num for a
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
number of reasons uh one of which is of
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
course the evolving department of energy
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
and defining
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
as it goes right now its role where it's
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to fit in the in the site
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation process
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion was held during that
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh that committee meeting over those
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee meetings over the summer so
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's one purpose
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh the second purpose is to look at
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
funding uh as you know the sec is
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh the business of the sec is done
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
sporadically there's no pattern of
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
requests for
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
for site evaluations to be done so the
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
funding which is tied generally to
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
fees is sporadic and so
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's the second purpose we're going to
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
take a look at with this proposed
 
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
take a look at with this proposed
committee

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
and then of course uh look at process
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the authority and the funding of
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
other organizations similar to our sec
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
that operate in other states perhaps get
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
a pattern from them that might work
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
better than what we have
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
and of course the role the department of
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
energy in
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
in all of this as we
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
move into what i would call the next
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
phase of energy development in our state
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
and with that mr chairman i'd be happy
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for that excellent
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
introduction to this bill we have
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator representative
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
i just have one quick question
 
00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.350 align:start position:0%

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee it says here in this bill that
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
as of a certain date does that
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
inherently mean that the function of the
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee is over at that point
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and if if not
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to something in
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
there that just says that the committee
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
will end after it submits its final
 
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.470 align:start position:0%
will end after it submits its final
report

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
i would think that since the final
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
report is the final report it would not
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
be improper to amend this to say that
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
that the committee goes away
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
it does have an effective date
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
i think wouldn't harm the bill to do
 
00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.069 align:start position:0%
i think wouldn't harm the bill to do
that

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
senator to clarify representative
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
it appears from the language of the bill
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
that it does not actually put
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
this language into statute it just
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
i've forgotten the term they use now um
 
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.470 align:start position:0%
i've forgotten the term they use now um
dormant

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
dormant
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know chapter law i think is that
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.269 align:start position:0%
that's the
term

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
so it just becomes chapter law so if it
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
is chapter law it will expire
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
with the end of the
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
calendar year is that true
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
it will okay thank you
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee had a question
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.230 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
um

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
my concern in the description that you
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
gave for
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
um reviewing the sec and whether it
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
under or rolled in with the department
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
of energy now that we have a department
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
is the same concern that we had when we
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
first looked at the 80 pages of language
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
that went into hb2
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
concerning whether there would be a
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
bright red line between regulatory
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
functions and
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
administrative or executive agency
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
functions which are
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
distinct in many ways but the regulatory
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
i think is intended to be separate so
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
that there
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
is no politics played in the discussions
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
around whether something should be cited
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
or how it should be cited
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
so i wonder if you could speak to the
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
concern that
 
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.030 align:start position:0%
concern that
um

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory body although it is used
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
infrequently uh at least has that bright
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
red line intact and that um and and
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you could just answer whether or
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
not that would be a consideration that
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
um kept in place for any committee that
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
is designed to try and replace what we
 
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:27.990 align:start position:0%
is designed to try and replace what we
have

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
that's excellent question thank you for
 
00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:30.389 align:start position:0%
that's excellent question thank you for
that

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
sec is seen now as more of an
 
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.389 align:start position:0%
sec is seen now as more of an
adjudicative

00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
adjudicative
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
rather than regulatory and that's where
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
we want to go that was the the consensus
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee going forward that met
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
so i think there'd be very clear line
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
that the sec would be adjudicative
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
and as we discussed the department of
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
energy would be the collector of data
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
for applications and the monitoring and
 
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.949 align:start position:0%
for applications and the monitoring and
enforcement

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh functions would be held over the
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy but the sec would
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
then be strictly adjudicative and
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
therefore removed from
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
the process of gathering the evidence
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
and and the uh the data that they need
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair follow-up thank you
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's helpful the clarification's
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
helpful so um
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
so with that being said
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
if it is an adjudicative body
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
and the information gathering would be
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
very similar to how the puc has been
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
reconfigured right that the department
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
of energy has the resources now from
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
that staff and
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
that would happen there um
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
i i guess the question would be
 
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
i i guess the question would be
um

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.829 align:start position:0%
um
on

00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
reconstituting the site evaluation
 
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.230 align:start position:0%
reconstituting the site evaluation
committee

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
what are the considerations around that
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
reconstitution in terms of
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
what would be
 
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.670 align:start position:0%
what would be
changing

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think i'd be less left up to the
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
committee to determine
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
again the function of this bill is to
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
put together a group to look at those
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
very types of questions
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
what does the future hold for the sec do
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
we even have an sec again i'm just
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
stating this hypothetical questions but
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
that's the function of the committee is
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
to sort that stuff out and come up with
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
the best proposal that will then come
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature for
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully answer those types of
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative vincent thank
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you senator
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh you had uh touched on um
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh funding
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
and how sporadic it was um
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
is it a great cost on the funding can
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
you give me any ideas
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
i think the funding depends on the
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
particular projects but the concern is
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
maintaining a staff
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
right that isn't that is not sporadic
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay so how often do these projects come
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
in not very often right so because of
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
that there's no general funds that i'm
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
aware of that are given to this they're
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
totally self-funded but
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
not having the ability to level you know
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
to maintain a stable budget
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh plays havoc with their ability to
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
function so that's the functionality of
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
the funding issue that i think will be
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
looked at how do we fund this more
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
effectively and there's some some
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
considerations that were given and
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts that were shared during that
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee process but again that would
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
be looked at by this committee
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you again
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
do you so you don't have a figure i mean
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
if we had to go pack for the last three
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
years or whatever it was i mean
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
is it like an over-the-top amount
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
or is it just uh i'm just trying to
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
understand um the reasoning for the
 
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.470 align:start position:0%
understand um the reasoning for the
funding

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
well the reason for the funding is to
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
enable the sec to function no i don't
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
have specific numbers but those are
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
available you know from the sec
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
okay one more follow-up thank you this
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
has to be the last time i appreciate
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
that and i understand that this is just
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
you want to set up a committee to study
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
study it um
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
uh and i understand uh what the prior
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
asked and i understand your answer
 
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.150 align:start position:0%
asked and i understand your answer
however

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
in fourth in in the forward thinking
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
thinking in do you have any
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
idea on
 
00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.110 align:start position:0%
idea on
how

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
these things would be looked at if you
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
didn't have
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
this event if you didn't have this site
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
at present time you wouldn't have any
 
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.350 align:start position:0%
at present time you wouldn't have any
any

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
capacity to evaluate these projects and
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate yes or no on these sites
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay they they bring in data from a
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
number of different sources department
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
of environmental you know des
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
transportation in a number of different
 
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
transportation in a number of different
departments

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
we felt that the department of energy
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
would be the best place to aggregate
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
that data to then present it
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh to the sec for them to then
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicate this is a good site this is
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
not a good site this needs to be changed
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
again that's a function of the study
 
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.150 align:start position:0%
again that's a function of the study
committee

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
we had neither the people nor the
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
resources nor the time over the course
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
of this one summer to look into the
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
depth of those but what came very clear
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
from our discussions was that we need to
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
look into this to make this more
 
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
look into this to make this more
efficient

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
more

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
rational less political
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
the efficiency piece is very important
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
i thank you senator and thank you mr
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative callie
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
pitts is recognized for a question
 
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.510 align:start position:0%
pitts is recognized for a question
finally

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.789 align:start position:0%
finally
um

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
this there's a couple of points i'd like
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
to make first one was
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
this last line on
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
page 20 is line 28 who the report goes
 
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.190 align:start position:0%
page 20 is line 28 who the report goes
to

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go back to the energy or the
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
i i would presume that if it goes to the
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house that being an
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
energy thing would go to the
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
energy committee right now technology uh
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh senator guider i would never assume
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
or presume well that's okay i think i i
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
think it's your representative
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
we're here to ask questions to gather
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
information not to debate and i think it
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
should be added do you do you present an
 
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.110 align:start position:0%
should be added do you do you present an
amendment

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's your function
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
so you would not object to that
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
no but i would object to the tone of the
 
00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:21.830 align:start position:0%
no but i would object to the tone of the
inquiry

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you the committee
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative you need a follow-up yes
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
i do okay october 15th is the date on
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
this of 2022
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
and we know that the house
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
does not meet for two months in the
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
summer committees etc there's kind of a
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
a block on those and they do not meet
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
so i think it's july and august and the
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
chairman can
 
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.549 align:start position:0%
chairman can
can

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
confirm that it's july and august
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
so when this committee and if this
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee gets going it will have one
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
out of this committee that this
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
committee has i i think has already gone
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
over haven't they
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
no the committee has not gone over those
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
and uh what the house rules are is up to
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
the house if you think the bill needs
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
amending then amend it
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
but we we need this done fairly soon and
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
i know that there were house members in
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
attendance at our meetings over the
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
course of the last summer
 
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.990 align:start position:0%
course of the last summer
so

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.830 align:start position:0%
so
again

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
this needs to get done if you feel the
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
bill should be amended i welcome you to
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
do so you have the power to do that
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you any further
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
we have another
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill coming over from the senate dealing
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
what what's your position on
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
you know one one says let's have a
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee to study what we should do and
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
the other one says here's what you
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
should do
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
could you give us a little insight into
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
that sure because there were there were
 
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.310 align:start position:0%
that sure because there were there were
two

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
there was a short-term and a long-term
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
look all right the short-term look is
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
fixed that we need to do right now
 
00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:09.430 align:start position:0%
fixed that we need to do right now
to

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
enhance the efficiency and enable the
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
continued functionality of the sec in a
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
way that meets the needs of the public
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's the short-term bill this is the
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
longer term bill this says okay let's
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
look long-range and let's take a look at
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
how we how we structure the relationship
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
between energy and sec how we fund the
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
sec and the issues that are presented in
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you very much so
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking for confirmation that
 
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.789 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking for confirmation that
by

00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill we're not
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
and that bill we're not creating a
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
conflict so there there's a definite
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
sense here of a short term in the long
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
term and the one does not presuppose the
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
actions of the other that is correct
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
bernardi is recognized for a question
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
senator gaida um
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
so as i understand this bill
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to rev
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
essentially reassess or revalidate the
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
the recommendations that
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
the earlier committee has done quite
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it looks
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
and then potentially offer a
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill that would uh
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
address those and
 
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
and turn those
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
reconsolidated or revalidated findings
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
into a piece of legislation is that that
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
do i have that right yes sir you
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely do thank you very much
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative samsich is recognized for
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
um and i i think the the last answer was
 
00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:02.950 align:start position:0%
um and i i think the the last answer was
really

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
really
good

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
useful information
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
however when i look at the bill it says
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
a committee to study the feasibility of
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
replacing the site evaluation committee
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
when you when you say replacing
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
are we talking about a new entity
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
entirely or are we just talking about
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
absorbing the functions within the
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think that the feasibility
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
would look at both sides
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
all right should we keep it as it is
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
should we change it should we eliminate
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
it so feasibility meaning
 
00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
it so feasibility meaning
the

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:39.450 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.710 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
effectiveness or efficiency of
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
continuing it forward so i think it'll
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
look at both sides and that's certainly
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
the intended legislation just to look at
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
all possibilities
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
oh yes sir thank you and just to clarify
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative vincent's question
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
are you do you know how many people
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
currently are
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
that this comprise the staff of the sec
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%

00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
i do not
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
i mean is it one person
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
two people i know i know at least we
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
have one person probably but uh is it a
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
dozen i do not know there are other
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
people who will testify who can probably
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
answer that question okay thank you very

hampshire department of environmental
 
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of environmental
services

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
um wanted to address some of the
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
questions that come came up
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually no one is working there is no
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
sec staff right now
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
um there are zero people
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
um representative vincent when diane
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
martin was the commissioner of sec she
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
did a report on funding needed for it
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to get that information
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
to the committee i've already made a
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
note to follow up on that
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
just so everyone knows for the sec
 
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.070 align:start position:0%
just so everyone knows for the sec
functions

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
functions
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
they're funded through the fees
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
collected by the applicants putting in
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
to build the sites
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
and there are many challenges with that
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
for instance when a
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
project receives a certificate from the
 
00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.470 align:start position:0%
project receives a certificate from the
fcc

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
fcc
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
part of the sec's responsibility is to
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
follow up on public complaints
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
right now that's not funded at all
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
existing projects that have complaints
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
outstanding that when you combine the no
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
staff with you know the uh and because
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
even if you had the one staffer who's
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
more administrative in function you need
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
to contract out the folks who do the
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
actual testing do the sound checks or
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the nature of the complaint is
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
um those aren't fun uh funded right now
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.549 align:start position:0%
at all
so

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
um there are oh by the way just so the
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee knows myself or bob scott who
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner scott acts as the
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh vice chair of sec in his role we both
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
served on this committee
 
00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:26.710 align:start position:0%
served on this committee
um

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
that came up with these recommendations
 
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.549 align:start position:0%
that came up with these recommendations
um

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
so the the gaps in the system are wide
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
and just so the committee knows
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
committee members know the way it
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
functions now if something comes up in
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
the process that's a des item it gets
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
referred to us if it's a fish and game
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
item it gets referred to fish and gabe
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
and then they handle it um
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
but if it's one of the if it's one of
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
the regulatory responsibilities that
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
specifically comes under the sdc
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's what that committee handles in
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
terms of responsibility
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
the the vision we had and center guided
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
a great job of of
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
kind of phrasing it we kind of had a two
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
phase idea with this last committee the
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
other bill that was mentioned that will
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
help with some just functions of
 
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.389 align:start position:0%
help with some just functions of
the

00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
the existing scc reducing threshold for
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
quorum because right now it's extremely
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
hard to get the committee to even meet
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
some ability to better fund it so it's
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
just addressing some of the
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
logistics challenges that exist with it
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and it functioning
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
um the goal of this would be to come up
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
with longer term solutions
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
um and to a couple of the questions out
 
00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:44.310 align:start position:0%
um and to a couple of the questions out
there

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
a logical
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
approach to this would be
 
00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:49.350 align:start position:0%
approach to this would be
to

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
fund a piece of the doe to handle the
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
regulatory responsibilities
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
just like
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
des does for our regulatory
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
responsibilities just like fish and game
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
does for their regulatory
 
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.190 align:start position:0%
does for their regulatory
responsibilities

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
and to the question of the bright red
 
00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
and to the question of the bright red
line

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that this is exactly the
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
kind of function
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
doe was meant to perform
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
just like the department of agriculture
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
department environmental services
 
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.470 align:start position:0%
department environmental services

the
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
correctly staffed department
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
that has experts in those areas
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
oversees the permitting process for them
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
that's how the rest of our state

this is opinion not represented of
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
myself as an individual
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
i would actually think it would be less
 
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.789 align:start position:0%
i would actually think it would be less
political

00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
it would function much more of the way
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the regulatory
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in in our state
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
function so with that happy to answer

thank you
commissioner

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
um how did the sec get here
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
how do we get to zero people and not be
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
being able to reply to to complaints uh
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner uh is it a was it
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
mainly a matter of of money funding or
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
was it a matter of
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh somebody not watching what's going on
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden everything kind of
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
blew apart
 
00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:46.230 align:start position:0%
blew apart
um

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
well indeference saw the folks who were
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for these and i i'll try and
 
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.110 align:start position:0%
responsible for these and i i'll try and
be

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
polite in my response it's a combination
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
of the things you mentioned funding has
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
always been a a challenge with it
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
it's an ad hoc group of folks all of
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
whom including the chair and the vice
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
chair have other responsibilities you're
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
the chair is the puc chair the
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
vice chair is the commissioner of
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
at most it's actual staff was always
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
only one person
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
um so it
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
again this is why i would argue it's
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
for something as important as energy
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure citing in the state
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
that's why i'd argue that the current
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
setup is is inadequate you you
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
you you don't you you think of all the
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
other regulatory responsibilities and
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
the staff that the the state dedicates
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
to those um and um
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
and and part of the challenge is its
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
feet it's completely fee funded which
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
can certainly work
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
just like fishing game a lot of our our
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
department can certainly work fee
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
structured but it needs a much better
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
structure than the one it has right now
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
so we we got here by
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
it probably
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
inadequately being set up
 
00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:07.110 align:start position:0%
inadequately being set up
and

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.029 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the committee being
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
larger than originally intended and
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
never really having a great funding
 
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.710 align:start position:0%
never really having a great funding
structure

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
i seem to recall and i wish
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
remind me that we
 
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.190 align:start position:0%
remind me that we
funded

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.389 align:start position:0%
funded
the

00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
sec with an additional funding was it
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
150 000
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
staff person
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
permanent staff person yep and
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
is that permanence
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
may i follow up
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
certainly is that staff person still
 
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.230 align:start position:0%
certainly is that staff person still
there

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
there
no

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
there uh that position has been open
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
going on you're probably about a year
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
now no one has filled that that role is
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
lack of interest
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
or is it because it wasn't actively
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
sought to refill that position
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of effort i promise
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
you um to try and find someone to fill
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
that position
 
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.669 align:start position:0%
that position
um

00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's uh the type of work it
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
and i know you guys have a lot of bills
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
in a real short version of the story
 
00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:29.430 align:start position:0%
in a real short version of the story
um

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.630 align:start position:0%
um
if

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
if you want to get a lawyer with a
 
00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:34.549 align:start position:0%
if you want to get a lawyer with a
background

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
in energy
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
policy energy law the type of folks that
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
was desired and
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
the qualifications of the last person
 
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.190 align:start position:0%
the qualifications of the last person
um

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
the salary is challenging in that market
 
00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:50.070 align:start position:0%
the salary is challenging in that market
um

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:50.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
it's a less known
 
00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:54.230 align:start position:0%
it's a less known
function

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
function
um

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of challenges in
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
terms of recruiting uh to get someone to
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
fill that role and the other big
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
challenge is the first person who gets
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
in there is going to have a whole list
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
of complaints
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
of on pre-existing projects that they're
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
not going to have any funding to address
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
so it's it's um
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's not overly attractive at the moment
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
to go in and you'll be dealing with a
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
lot of folks who have been waiting over
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
a year to have their complaint addressed
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
and you don't have any funding to
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
follow up on for them
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
i i need to follow up on that one more
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
that hundred and fifty thousand dollars
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't doesn't sound like a lot of
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
money but that hundred and fifty
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
thousand is additional to anything else
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
that was collected by fees is that
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars still
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
sitting in obey in some place or yeah it
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
hasn't been i mean again i'm not
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not the accountant for the sec but
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
the there is funding right now if we
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
um if between the commissioner and uh
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the if we were able to
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
identify a candidate we would be able to
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
hire that person
 
00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
hire that person
immediately

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's the other functions that wouldn't
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
be funded
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
that would make that role
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
so the role is funded if we if we if
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
there was someone who was
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
um who was interested in the job we
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
could hire that person right now
 
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.550 align:start position:0%
could hire that person right now
but

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't collected
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
the sec hasn't collected the necessary
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
funding on the last estimate and please
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
don't hold it to me i will get the
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
committee the report from
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
diane martin and pam monroe the last
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
administrator for sec did
 
00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:44.390 align:start position:0%
administrator for sec did
but

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
it would need
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
a we when we did the committee
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
we needed like 500 000
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh we needed around 500 000
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
to follow up to be able to hire the
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
technicians that would be needed to
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
follow up on the complaints to to do the
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
work that would be required in terms of
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
following up
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the the public inquiries that have
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
represent little wiki you're free to ask
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
a question okay thank you mr chairman
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
can you give us an idea of how much on
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
in an average year is generated by fees
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
to the sec because clearly
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to fund the whole
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
thing out of general fund and if there
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
is some base
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
line that we can work from then that
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
would let us have an idea of how it
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
could work
 
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.030 align:start position:0%
could work
so

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
again the report that i'll get you all
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
is going to be much more illuminating
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
than my testimony
 
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.750 align:start position:0%
than my testimony
but

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.190 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
it is challenging to
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
do an average because it's purely based
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
on the number of
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
applications so
 
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.510 align:start position:0%
applications so
you

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
if you if there's a year where there
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
were three applications to the sec
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
for a certificate that year's
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
fee collection is going to be much
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
higher than a year where it hasn't had
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
any the sec
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't really met in about a year so
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been any um applications or
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
collection of
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
of fees
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
going on a year now so um that's why
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're in we're in a challenge where
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to meet quorum just
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the membership
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
um we haven't had an administrator
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
and we haven't had the funding
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
to perform the responsibilities of the
 
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.790 align:start position:0%
to perform the responsibilities of the
sec

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
sec
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
how do i phrase this a couple of people
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
have mentioned that it's become
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
political and maybe
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
pull back
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
in my view sec has gone for a body that
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
reviews an application
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
and then suggests improvements or
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
changes to make it acceptable to a
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee of no
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
and is is the uh
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
reason why there it hasn't met any years
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
because it's a committee of no so no
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
applications are going to be coming
 
00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:12.550 align:start position:0%
applications are going to be coming
forth

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
well i would say
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
there's certainly an element of that
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative i i'd honestly say the
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
bigger reason it hasn't met for a year
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
is for most of them
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
designated members um this is
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know low on their priority list the
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioners the state librarian
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the folks who are the the members of
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
the sec this is a second job and
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
not their area of expertise for a lot of
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
them and not their primary of
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility and it's just hard to get
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
seven of them
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
at any given moment to to meet
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
and and and be able to have a full
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
meeting of quorum under the current
 
00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.870 align:start position:0%
meeting of quorum under the current
statute

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
so i i'd more lean it towards
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
for most of the membership this isn't
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
their primary
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility or priority
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr sanborn i have one
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay i was gonna have a final question
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
but i'll defer to uh representative
 
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
but i'll defer to uh representative
pimentel

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
pimentel
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um
 
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.470 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um
this

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
what the sec does is very important to
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
the people who are waiting to get a
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
response so that their project can move
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
i mean this is the complaint not what
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
the decisions are but how long it takes
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
to get them
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
we've talked about how sporadic
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
the the work is for the scc because it's
 
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.190 align:start position:0%
the the work is for the scc because it's
and

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i i my question is
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to
 
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.270 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to
either

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
expand the scope of the sec to give them
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
more work and therefore less
 
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.430 align:start position:0%
more work and therefore less
sporadic

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
sporadic
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
or to just
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
find a suitable
 
00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:08.550 align:start position:0%
find a suitable
home

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.349 align:start position:0%
home
for

00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
what is done at the sec
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
with some other body to kind of
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know so so that there is not that
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
sporadic nature yeah no no it's a great
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
question and it is what this committee
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
would look at
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
without being too presumptuous and
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
offering again my individual opinion
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
versus official administration policy um
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
i tend to fall in the latter of your two
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
options um
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
with the creation of the department of
 
00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:41.829 align:start position:0%
with the creation of the department of
energy

00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
and you know seeing how the
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
similar functions on different subject
 
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.510 align:start position:0%
similar functions on different subject
areas

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know the poor mining process
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
happens at des fish and game agriculture
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
i think for the
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
the regulatory permitting
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
functions of the sec that aren't
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
assigned to other
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
other agencies would fit very nicely
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
at a well-staffed
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
department of energy that could still be
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
fee-based you know it doesn't have to
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
all be funded through the
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
general fund and um but it would be part
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
of a department that um could better
 
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.190 align:start position:0%
of a department that um could better
structure

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
an organization
 
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
an organization
um

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
with folks who this is their primary
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility versus an ad hoc that um
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
is only administratively attached to
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
another body
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't have the resources of
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
that would be offered by a full
 
00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:46.630 align:start position:0%
that would be offered by a full
department

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative mann one one
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
question please yes thanks um thank you
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh as i recall the
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee got started
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
because of uh northern pass
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
and p an enormous objection
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
to people uh to their what would they
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
they considered a you know an
 
00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.510 align:start position:0%
they considered a you know an
unreasonably

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonably
 
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.470 align:start position:0%
unreasonably
ugly

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
ugly
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
transformation of our wonderful forests
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
it does
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
could the
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:29.109 align:start position:0%
 
scope

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
scope
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
full scope of a
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee could be
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
contained in
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
just the department of energy without
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
bringing in
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
people representing uh
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
other perspectives uh interests and so
 
00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:44.790 align:start position:0%
other perspectives uh interests and so
on

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
so the site of actually the committee
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually did exist prior to northern
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
pass it it was created to address
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
um like very common in new hampshire you
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
know very well um it was created to
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
address a gap
 
00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:04.230 align:start position:0%
address a gap
in

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the permitting process the
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
it of course became a lot better known
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
because of northern pass
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
and the conversations as a resulting
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
from that so
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
um and this committee part of what this
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
committee would do
 
00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:20.470 align:start position:0%
committee would do
is

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.750 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
try and
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
the the public transparency in the
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
public input is the piece you're talking
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
about and that
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
we talked a lot about it
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
over the summer
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
and that would certainly be a big part
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
of the conversation
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
i will say this
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
it would have the same public
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
transparency and the and the same
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
ability for public input
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
and um appeals
 
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
and um appeals
that

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
any permit we make right now at des
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
there every permit we do at des there's
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities um for folks to appeal our
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
decisions and and and and
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
challenge whether des got it right and
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
um that would exist and that's the same
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
the other state agencies and and that
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
would that could very easily exist with
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
this thank you thank you
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%

01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
bill uh 440. this is uh one of a pair of
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
um offshore wind bills that you're going
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
to see from me
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
and they are interlinked so i just want
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
to mention that at the
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
at the start
 
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.990 align:start position:0%
at the start
um

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
by way of some background i know members
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
of this committee are well aware
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
development of offshore wind in the gulf
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
of maine and the great efforts that have
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
been under
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
taken by our department of energy and
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
mark sanborn of assistant commissioner
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
sanborn of
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
des we do have an offshore
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
wind and port development commission
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's been meeting for a couple of
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
years members of the committee are are
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
on that and we do have the bureau of
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
ocean energy management uh task force
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
meeting for the gulf of maine coming up
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
on may 19th so a lot going on and i
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't really feel any need to rehearse
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
what's going on about offshore wind
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
along the atlantic coast and
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
particularly in the gulf of maine
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
because that's that's all out there
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about
 
01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:03.430 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about
really

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
what we may or may not think of offshore
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
wind and how it's coming how it's being
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
developed it's about protecting new
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire's interests
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
and so what senate bill 440 proposes to
 
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
and so what senate bill 440 proposes to
do

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
is to direct our
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
still relatively new
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
office of offshore wind industry
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
development to look at what criteria we
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
need to develop that protects new
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire ratepayers and our interests
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that time when we will
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
begin to see
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
utilities come in with power purchase
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
agreements for that power
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that is particularly uh
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
what this is about
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
and i will say the state has been
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
investigating through a number of
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
studies that
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
authorized for executive authors and
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
otherwise to how to properly foster
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
economic development related offshore
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
wind and what the powers should be going
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
forward requiring
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
cost of energy power purchase agreements
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
and renewable energy credits and so
 
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.910 align:start position:0%
and renewable energy credits and so
forth

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
and i will note that you know governor
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
sununu's leadership and offshore wind he
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
called for the formation of the task
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
force a couple years ago and that task
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
force of maine new hampshire and
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has been has been formed
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
had one meeting back in december
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
of uh 2019 and coveted came and now
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
we're having our next meeting
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
on may
 
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.069 align:start position:0%
on may
19th

01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
19th
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
i will also notice as well that
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
sanborn has taken the lead in making
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
sure we have additional information the
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
governor authorized us an rfp to be
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
done for a really comprehensive study of
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
the offshore wind industry and we will
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
shortly have an announcement about that
 
01:03:51.839 --> 01:03:52.950 align:start position:0%
shortly have an announcement about that
rfp

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
rfp
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
so the timing here is is quite good for
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
this bill we are going to have over the
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
next six to nine months
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
a great deal of information
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
coming through that rfp about everything
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
that we need to know about offshore wind
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
and its impacts on
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire and the timing is also
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
good for this report because if as the
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
plan seems to be that we begin to see
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
lease areas identified
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the auction occurring in 2024
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
that's the time in which we need to be
 
01:04:21.839 --> 01:04:22.950 align:start position:0%
that's the time in which we need to be
ready

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
to determine what how we will view these
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
agreements that come
 
01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.470 align:start position:0%
agreements that come
in

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
so the bill is fairly simple in its uh
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
statement here you'll see starting on
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
line seven at the office of offshore
 
01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:36.069 align:start position:0%
line seven at the office of offshore
wind

01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
wind
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
industry development which the
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for this um shall
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
consult with the appropriate agencies
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
receive those reports that are under way
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
stakeholders utilities and so forth on
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
and create recommendations regarding
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
development of clean energy resources
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the gulf of maine
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
the particulars of this start on line
 
01:04:55.839 --> 01:04:57.510 align:start position:0%
the particulars of this start on line
12.

01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
what should the criteria be for
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
evaluating power purchase agreements for
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
and particularly note starting on line
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
14. here's where we protect new
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire's interests
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
these contracts ought to be
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable and then most
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
importantly cost effective for electric
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
rate payers in new hampshire
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that as we do need to
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
diversify our
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
energy sources to make sure that there
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
is reliability here
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
and uh that there are environmental
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
benefits uh and i think particularly
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
that there are not environmental
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
consequences um and then also that we
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
look to contracts that are likely to
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
help us economically and in terms of
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
jobs and economic development and not
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
that those
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
resources are just going to other states
 
01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.190 align:start position:0%
resources are just going to other states
workers

01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
and secondly and this is
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
starting on 18 which is relates to what
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to see senate bill
 
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.109 align:start position:0%
you're going to see senate bill
268

01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
268
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we need to make sure that new
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire's interests on fisheries and
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
the environment are respected in
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
whatever contracts come forward for the
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
purchase of offshore win
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
so this is the interlinking here
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
that as we if we pass senate bill 268
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
and we declare consistency under federal
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines which means that we have
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority not just three
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
miles out but 200 miles out so we can
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
protect our fisheries and our
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
environment under that consistency
 
01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:38.789 align:start position:0%
environment under that consistency
provision

01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
that then
 
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.430 align:start position:0%
that then
this

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
these contracts have to respect the
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
evaluation made under that consistency
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
process and this is just crucial
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
to our environmental and our commercial
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
and transit interests out in the gulf of
 
01:06:56.559 --> 01:06:58.069 align:start position:0%
and transit interests out in the gulf of
maine

01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
and then finally what are we going to do
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
about the renewable energy credits that
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
are produced by offshore wind how are
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
they they're going to be very valuable
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be distributed how
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
are they going to benefit new hampshire
 
01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.230 align:start position:0%
are they going to benefit new hampshire
ratepayers

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
so that's the purpose of the bill mr mr
 
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.829 align:start position:0%
so that's the purpose of the bill mr mr
chairman

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
it is meant to
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
make sure the office of
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
the office of offshore wind industry
 
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.950 align:start position:0%
the office of offshore wind industry
development

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
development
takes

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
takes
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
does his activities here
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
of course we have that office there
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
because of the offshore wind
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
development that's coming along and
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
it was passed and that's why the
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
governor funded it
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
but i think even more importantly given
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
the division between the department of
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
energy and the puc it should be the
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
department of energy which creates the
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
criteria for this contract evaluation
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
because the puc can't do that anymore
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
and so we will be teed up and ready to
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
go to to direct the puc as the
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
legislature should do
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
as to the criteria to use to evaluate
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
these resources thank you and i'll take
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you senator uh representative
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
plett you have a question yes i do thank
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
or a hand jammer
 
01:08:08.799 --> 01:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
or a hand jammer
a

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
that was a shaky remark
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you son of the waters for
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned the
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
office of offshore
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
in uh what is it in this
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
site of in the in the department of
 
01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:26.149 align:start position:0%
site of in the in the department of
energy

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry development is
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
that fully existing fully funded big
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
enough to handle this now and that's why
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you that's all
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative harrington
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman thank you for
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question senator uh you know i
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
read through this bill and i say
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
seems to make pretty much sense to me
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
but my question is
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
isn't this what the offshore wind
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
development uh
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
agency is supposed to be doing anyways
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like we're writing a bill
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
to say go do your job
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see much of anything in here
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't and shouldn't be doing
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
without legislation normally we don't
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
unless it's something very unusual or
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
different we usually don't legislate a
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
agency to say you'll be like saying des
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
make sure you issue permits only issue
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
permits for
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
a pollution that's within the limits set
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
by law we don't tell them to do that
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
because it's implied they will is this
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not without disagreeing on the
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
particulars of the bill is it really
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
necessary for the bill especially given
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
that rfp you were talking about
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
uh thank goodness inheritance you know i
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
was i was excited there for a minute
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
when you said you liked the bill and it
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
seemed to make sense but i was waiting
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
for the butt okay
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
and i got it so
 
01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.349 align:start position:0%
and i got it so
um

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
well here's the thing see what the bill
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
does is it amends the duties of that
 
01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.309 align:start position:0%
does is it amends the duties of that
office

01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
because as with the des or elsewhere the
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to define
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
what the duties of the various agencies
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
and offices are so that's why that's why
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's important for this to lay it out
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the particularly mr gemini could
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
follow because they make this faster so
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
you're saying it expands and defines
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
some additional duties to the office
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and you've answered my question
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm just saying those particulars
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
are important the consistency references
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
the cost effectiveness and benefit for
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire these are things i think
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants to ensure that we
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
protect new hampshire ratepayers and
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is how we do it
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you senate waters i have one last
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
question seeing no others just a
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
curiosity question
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
i see nowhere in this bill any reference
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
to the offshore wooden port authority
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
development commission
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
was that intentional or should there not
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
be some tie-in like sending reports to
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
that commission as well for instance
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
well i i thought i thank you for your
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
question and i thought that um
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
that was kind of covered in line eight
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
um you know other relevant stakeholders
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly that commission will
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know we have a lot of hearings we've
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
already had a lot of information we can
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
we can provide i personally think the
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
most important thing here
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
is the results we're going to get from
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
the rfp that assistant commissioner
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
sanborn has um
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
has developed with the department of
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
energy and but yes of course they'll be
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
involved but that's why i phrased it
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay so there will be interaction
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you so much thank you
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
and i have to uh please if any other
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
questions come up you know where to find
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay mr roberge from department of
 
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.229 align:start position:0%
okay mr roberge from department of
energy

01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thomas members of the
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record uh griffin
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
roberts from the new hampshire
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.390 align:start position:0%
department of energy
um

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on senator
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
waters senate bill 440.
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
just by way of background the office of
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry development was
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
originally created i believe and mark
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
you can correct me
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
under house bill 1245
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
in 2020 it was originally housed in the
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
department of business and economic
 
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
affairs but with the reorganization of
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
the department of energy it was housed
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
with us under the last budget
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
so obviously as amended the bill does
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
two things
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
in section one it adds a duty to the
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
office of offshore wind industry
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
development advising the governor state
 
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.229 align:start position:0%
development advising the governor state
agencies

01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
puc and the legislature on the
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
development of clean energy resources in
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
the gulf of maine
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
section two is where it comes down to a
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
requirement for the individual in the
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
office of offshore wind industry
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
development to generate a report based
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
on the criteria outlined in section two
 
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
and that runs from about lines 6 to
 
01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.030 align:start position:0%
and that runs from about lines 6 to
24.

01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
24.
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
on line 25
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
the office shall issue its report by
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
june 30th of 2024
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh the report is to be issued by
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
to a number of entities as outlined in
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
that section
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
again while while the department doesn't
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
take any position on the bill we're
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
confident that the office uh would be
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
able to complete the report within the
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
proposed timeline and as noted in the
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note with existing staff and
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
existing resources um that concludes my
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
comments and happy to take any questions
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr roberts i see a question
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative harrington thank you mr
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
question so it sounds like you agree
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
with senator waterstone that there is an
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
expansion of the duties of the offshore
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
wind uh department yeah
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
in looking at it just adds one duty to
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
clearly advise the governor and state
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
agencies and public utilities commission
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
obviously there are other duties part of
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
that office but i guess you could say
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
so you know the first no other questions
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr griffin thank you i will
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
morning again for the record mark
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
sanborn d.s assistant commissioner
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
i know you guys have a lot of bills just
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to really quickly
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
um reiterate the importance of this bill
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
along with other senator waters bills
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
whether you're pro offshore wind neutral
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
or have concerns with offshore wind
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
i've been leading our effort in terms of
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
interacting with boem
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
and that process because a lot of what
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
they look at is the environmental side
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
because this will be happening in
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
federal waters whether new hampshire
 
01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.110 align:start position:0%
federal waters whether new hampshire
supports

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
supports
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
offshore wind in the gulf of maine or
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
not it could come
 
01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.070 align:start position:0%
not it could come
so

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
the critical
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
why the two bills are critical is the
 
01:14:52.719 --> 01:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
why the two bills are critical is the
one

01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
the one ability a state has to make sure
 
01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.709 align:start position:0%
the one ability a state has to make sure
their

01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:14:58.719 --> 01:14:59.750 align:start position:0%
their
um

01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
their impacts to their state and their
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
constituents are addressed is through
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
federal consistency if you're a coastal
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
community a coastal state
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
but the but the rub with federal
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
consistency is you can only claim
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
federal consistency in federal waters if
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
state legislation exists on that subject
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
so you can't
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
you can't talk about
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
wanting to protect your new hampshire
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
commercial fishing industry if you don't
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
have state legislation talking about
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
doing that if it were to happen in the
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
three miles off of the state coast
 
01:15:39.679 --> 01:15:40.550 align:start position:0%
three miles off of the state coast
so

01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
the the real importance of senator
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
waters bills and why we've been working
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
with them on them is it puts into state
 
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.550 align:start position:0%
with them on them is it puts into state
statute

01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.350 align:start position:0%
statute
the

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.550 align:start position:0%
the
issues

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
um and and how new hampshire would
 
01:15:53.199 --> 01:15:54.229 align:start position:0%
um and and how new hampshire would
approach

01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
um compensating commercial fishermen
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
protecting our environment protecting
 
01:15:58.800 --> 01:15:59.830 align:start position:0%
protecting our environment protecting
uh

01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know our approach to offshore wind
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
so and because it won't happen within
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
three miles it probably won't even
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
happen within 20 miles of the coastline
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
it'll be in federal waters this will
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
give new hampshire the ability to even
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
if it's another state and the federal
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
government moving forward at least have
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
a voice and a seat at the table so you
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
know so representative harrington this
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
gets a little bit to your question the
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
other reason to get this on
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
on the wreck in our state statute more
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
definitively is it would help us if we
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
had to go to noaa with with uh arguing
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
state of federal consistency if we
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
weren't comfortable with the direction
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh a project was going
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
so i just i just wanted that's a key
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
part of why we've been working with
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
senator waters on this and his other
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr sanborn uh so just for
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
clarification uh uh pardon me from
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
stating it three times in other words
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would make new hampshire a
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholder yes exactly and and and it
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
would check the boxes needed to be
 
01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:05.189 align:start position:0%
would check the boxes needed to be
checked

01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
checked
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
for us to work with the federal
 
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.229 align:start position:0%
for us to work with the federal
government

01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:17:08.239 --> 01:17:08.950 align:start position:0%
government
to

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
to
assert

01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
assert
 
01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
assert
um

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
our approach to these uh if a project
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
was happening in federal waters because
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
it is in our state statute if we don't
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
have it in state statute you can't claim
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
federal consistency
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
very good makes sense
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
is there anything consistent about the
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
wow we don't have nearly enough time to
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay no seeing no further questions
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr sanborn thank you seeing no
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
other speakers on the docket i will ask
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
again representative vincent if he could
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay one is pro is kelly
 
01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.790 align:start position:0%
okay one is pro is kelly
bucknan

bucknan
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
and we have 33 in support
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
online zero opposed zero neutral it's
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
still open until tonight for people
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
watching online who'd like to sign it
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
with that said i declared the public
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
hearing for 440 closed
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
meet again at 11 o'clock
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.239 --> 01:19:20.229 align:start position:0%
 
11.

01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.239 --> 01:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.440 --> 01:21:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to call to order
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
the public hearing for
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%

259
i

02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
am looking to see if any of the
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill are here that would
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
introduce it
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i do not see any
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
so what i would do with this point is
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
out of courtesy i will introduce the
 
02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.510 align:start position:0%
out of courtesy i will introduce the
bill

02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:01:15.679 --> 02:01:17.189 align:start position:0%
we can
either

02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
well i would say recess until they got
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
here but i think it's getting kind of
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
late so we can just go ahead with
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
some of our speakers that we have listed
 
02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:25.990 align:start position:0%
some of our speakers that we have listed
here

02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%

definition of a municipal host
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%

02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%

elvis has left the building so thank you
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i am here today
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
to to introduce senate bill 259
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 259 is a small housekeeping
 
02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
item related to the passage of hb 315
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
that we passed last year
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
hb 315 touched on many energy related
 
02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
hb 315 touched on many energy related
issues

02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
but today's bill focuses solely on what
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
is considered to be eligible municipal
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
customers under the expanded net
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
metering provision
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
while hb 315 raised the net metering cap
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
from one to five megawatts it limited
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
parties participating
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
participating customers exclusively to
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
which is important so under hb 315
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions are defined as
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
quote any city town county school
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
district charitable public schools
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
villages a village district sau or any
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
district are entitled to create a
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
special purpose administered or funded
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
by any of the above named government
 
02:03:51.599 --> 02:03:52.470 align:start position:0%
by any of the above named government
units

02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
units
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
as originally introduced sb 259
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
sought to slightly amend this definition
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
by adding
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and offering
 
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
charity as the eligible housing
 
02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:04.709 align:start position:0%
charity as the eligible housing
authorities

02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
the bill was also amended in the senate
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
to include the peace development
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
authority and similar quasi-public
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
entities to the definition and i hope
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
you will support this bill
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative vox name
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
you for being here and for introducing
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
this bill um i have a related problem in
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
my area of the uh
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
where we have multiple
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
service territories that do not coincide
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
with municipal lines and i'm wondering
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
if you would support an amendment
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
that would remove line the one sentence
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
on lines six through eight
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
which specifies that a municipal host
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
shall be located in the same
 
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:57.270 align:start position:0%
shall be located in the same
municipality

02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
as the group members
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
for our
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
group hosts we only require that they be
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
part of the same service territory
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that they'd be in
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
the same service territory and in the
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
same municipality
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
and since county and state are here it
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
seems to introduce an inconsistency in
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
the bill and removing this one sentence
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
would eliminate that problem
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you might support
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
that amendment if all of you do
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
all of this how about a majority
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
the majority if you if you support it
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
then i'm not married to it if you want
 
02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:36.470 align:start position:0%
then i'm not married to it if you want
to

02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
i want to build a pass and i know that
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
there was some heartburn with quasi
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
public entities
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
so uh if you want to change that to uh
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
maybe university system which you know
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm again it's uh
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's up to your discretion you know i
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
just want to make this this malleable
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:05:55.199 --> 02:05:56.550 align:start position:0%
and and
eligible

02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
for uh yeah it's in there
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah if you have heartburn with that
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
just uh let us know i know senator
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
perkins cuoco she was really concerned
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
about the university systems
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
and uh that that might disqualify them
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure if it does or not so
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we put in the language
 
02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:15.990 align:start position:0%
that's why we put in the language
quasi

02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
quasi
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
public private yeah public or private
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
entities so
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
with that you know i'm going to leave it
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
up to you folks and we'll we'll come up
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
with some type of compromise on that but
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the suggestion
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
if there's one more question mr chair i
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take it but i got to fly i
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
do know you're busy
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
if we'll take one more question
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel if it's a short
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
question please yes thank you mr
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:40.870 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
question

02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i like the quasi public
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
youtube entity because it
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's kind of vague and i'm just
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
wondering in your opinion
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
would something like a mobile home park
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
fit under that
 
02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
fit under that
quasi

02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
quasi
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
public entity i don't think so
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm not i don't think a public
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
mobile public park
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think that follows under
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation but i
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
maybe for future if you want to address
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
that in another piece of legislation
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that follows under
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
that and i think that's why there's
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
heartburn because of it's quasi so it's
 
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
heartburn because of it's quasi so it's
like

02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
what's quasi
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you senator uh for your
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%

02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%

02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
speaker which is
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
kelly buchanan from clean angie speak
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%

good morning everyone thank you for the
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak this morning my
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
name is kelly buchanan i represent clean
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i would like to speak in support of
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
senate bill 259 we see this is a
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
housekeeping item as senator avard
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that clarifies the definition
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
of a political subdivision of the state
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
under house bill 315's changes from last
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
year and this makes the bill clear to
 
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
implement and removes any possible
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
ambiguity from the implementation
 
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
approval of these municipal net metering
 
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.350 align:start position:0%
approval of these municipal net metering
plans

02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
plans
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
this more accurate definition also
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
supports the goals of house bill 315
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
that this committee worked on and helped
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
strengthen local choice energy
 
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
independence and opportunities for
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
energy cost savings at the local level
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we're glad to support this we
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
personally do not have any heartburn
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the quasi
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
public entity but if the committee sees
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
i just fit to change that we would happy
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to consider that especially as
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
senator abraham mentioned with the
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
university system that came from senator
 
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
perkins cloka's bill which was senate
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill 370.
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
so just finding a way to combine those
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
is the goal here
 
02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
so i'd be happy to take any questions
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative oxnam
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and it's the same
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
question that i just gave to the sponsor
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
would you support removing that one
 
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
sentence line six through eight which
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
puts an inconsistency into the bill
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
sure i haven't had an opportunity to
 
02:09:44.229 --> 02:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
fully digest that change but i would
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
echo the sponsor in saying that if it
 
02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:47.270 align:start position:0%
echo the sponsor in saying that if it
was

02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
the majority opinion of this committee
 
02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
we certainly would support that thank
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
my question this is a clerk question i
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
was trying to scan your letter testimony
 
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i missed what you said about senate
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill 370. so would you repeat that
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
please yes uh of course thank you
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative senate bill 370 was um a
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
bill from represent or excuse me senator
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
perkins quoca
 
02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:14.149 align:start position:0%
perkins quoca
that

02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
also attempted to clarify the definition
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
of a political subdivision and on the
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
senate side of things when both of these
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
bills were heard both senate bill 259
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 370 there was some
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
discussion of that they could not be
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
separate bills due to the legislative
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
process and
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
which one would be assigned into law
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
first that could possibly
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
negate the other so the committee worked
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
to find an amendment to the preferable
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle which is senate bill 259 so that
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
they could be combined
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
and that has been achieved with the
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
addition of quasi public entity in this
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
bill as well as peace development
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
authority as a political subdivision
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands up now so i'll ask
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
one final question
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
for my own edification could you explain
 
02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:11:08.550 --> 02:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes what exactly will it
 
02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:09.350 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes what exactly will it
do

02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
and will it have any effect whatsoever
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
on the electric rate payers
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
i do not believe it will have an effect
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
on the electric rate payers i think this
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill is entirely within the scope of
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 315 which this committee
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
passed last year and i think what's been
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
seen is that in the implementation of
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 315 the department of energy
 
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
has done an admirable job of
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
interpreting the language of that
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
statute but i will not speak for the
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
department but i have heard from folks
 
02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
that have applied for these programs
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
that there is some ambiguity in exactly
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
what political subdivision means and so
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here in senate
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill 259 is to clarify that to make the
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
department's life easier to make this
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
process easier for those applying for
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
the programs
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
all while staying within the scope of
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
the intentions of house bill 315 which
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
was quite a limited expansion of net
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
metering simply for municipal and
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
02:12:07.679 --> 02:12:08.709 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
okay

02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you see any other questions thank
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%

02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
senator avar senate bill 259
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
as you've heard and by way of background
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 315 was signed into law last
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
year that expanded net metering above
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
the current one megawatt net metering
 
02:12:49.119 --> 02:12:50.229 align:start position:0%
the current one megawatt net metering
cap

02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
cap
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
creating this definition that you see in
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
for municipal hosts which are customer
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
generators between 1 and 5 megawatts
 
02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
that can group a net meter with
 
02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:04.229 align:start position:0%
that can group a net meter with
exclusively

02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
with a group consisting of one or more
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
customers who are political subdivisions
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
and then within that definition of
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
municipal host there's a definition of
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
the bill obviously expands the
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
definition of political subdivision to
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
include state of new hampshire housing
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
authorities quasi public entities and
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
the pease development authority um again
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
by way of background since that bill has
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
become law the department has registered
 
02:13:33.669 --> 02:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
for municipal hosts in the state uh all
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
four are our hydroelectric facilities
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
located in gorham berlin hillsborough
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
and milton
 
02:13:40.639 --> 02:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
and milton
um

02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
as i said then has been stated senate
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
bill 259 would expand the definition of
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
political subdivision to include those
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
entities you see outlined in bold um
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
again the department is neutral but we
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
did want to raise a technical concern
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
that appears to have been raised
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
already in the phrase quasi-public
 
02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:00.550 align:start position:0%
already in the phrase quasi-public
entities

02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
entities
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
that that phrase isn't defined anywhere
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
in state statute and could be read
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
rather ambiguously
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
so if this bill were to move forward i
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
think the department would welcome some
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
specificity on what the legislature
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
wants to define quasi public entity as
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
additionally and i'm
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
at the risk of having somebody throw
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
something at me the department does have
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
an ongoing vdr study
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
that is slated to be released in late
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
spring of this year
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
and that will also help the guy help
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
guide the future of net metering in the
 
02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:37.910 align:start position:0%
guide the future of net metering in the
state

02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
that really concludes my comments and uh
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
more than willing to take questions
 
02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes what's a vdr study i apologize uh
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
vder stands for value of distributed
 
02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:52.830 align:start position:0%
vder stands for value of distributed
energy

02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
resources and that study uh has been
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
conducted as part of the net metering
 
02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:01.189 align:start position:0%
conducted as part of the net metering
docket

02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
docket
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
and that study should be concluded uh in
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
you just represented you're free to
 
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
you just represented you're free to
speak

02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chair
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
um while we have you mr robert yes
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about the bder study
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
can you give us just a little bit more
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
insight into
 
02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
who's working on it and
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
approximately what it will encompass
 
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
sure so the department has retained a
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
consultant please forgive me i don't
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
have the specific name of the consultant
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but um it's it
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
would be looking into issues such as
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
potential cost shifts that shifting that
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
might be occurring in the state
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
potential cost increases rate billing
 
02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
impacts and that type of thing and it
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
would largely
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire new hampshire-centric data
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
rather than you know say nationwide
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
region-wide and that type of thing and
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
again slade to be released in late
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
spring of 2022. follow up
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
so you said it's new hampshire-centric
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
data regarding potential cost shifting
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
for distributed energy um
 
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
are you looking at any other precedent
 
02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:09.669 align:start position:0%
are you looking at any other precedent
studies

02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
studies
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
that other states have done similar i
 
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't comment definitively on that
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
just because
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not involved day to day in the study
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
but i can certainly follow up with would
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
you love to get some follow-up on that
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and if i
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
might just follow up on that line of
 
02:16:32.479 --> 02:16:33.669 align:start position:0%
might just follow up on that line of
inquiry

02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say i've been involved in
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
the puc docket that created the vdr
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
study from the beginning and i just
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
would like it to be included in the
 
02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
record it is not simply about cost
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
shifting or potential cost increases it
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
is about the value of distributed energy
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
resources and as other states have found
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
there are many instances in which
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
the value of those resources is
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
undervalued and they're so it's it's a
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
wide open uh mandate to look at
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
what is the contribution of those
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
resources to our energy system
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that's correct yes
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that statement question
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
let's stick to questions for
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr roberts
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
i guess my
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
concern is it's something that i don't
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
power lines distribution systems
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
are not
 
02:17:46.319 --> 02:17:47.429 align:start position:0%
are not
uh

02:17:47.429 --> 02:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:47.439 --> 02:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
uh
necessarily

02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
to a particular town power lines
 
02:17:52.399 --> 02:17:54.150 align:start position:0%
to a particular town power lines
crosstowns

02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
crosstowns
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh distribution systems will
 
02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:58.230 align:start position:0%
uh distribution systems will
uh

02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
as for instance in
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
my town of henniker
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
i seem to be on a distribution system
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
that comes from
 
02:18:06.559 --> 02:18:07.589 align:start position:0%
that comes from
warner

02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
warner
 
02:18:07.599 --> 02:18:08.790 align:start position:0%
warner
and

02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
most of the town
 
02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:11.910 align:start position:0%
most of the town
is

02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
attached to a distribution system which
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
comes up from where
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering how does that
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
would that relate
 
02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
would that relate
to

02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:22.950 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
if there were if
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
one or the other was a municipal host
 
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.349 align:start position:0%
one or the other was a municipal host
um

02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
if it if it doesn't cross town lines
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
so basically the question that uh
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham was asking about
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
i mean how can you
 
02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
yeah it cuts that up i thank you for the
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
question representative so you know
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
obviously the language that
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham specified on
 
02:18:47.439 --> 02:18:48.709 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham specified on
lines

02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
six to eight um are you know it clearly
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
says that the municipal house shall be
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
located in the same municipality as all
 
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
group members so you know taking the
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
example as you referenced you know if
 
02:18:58.800 --> 02:18:59.669 align:start position:0%
example as you referenced you know if
you're

02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
a municipal host that's located in
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
henniker and you came into operation
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
after january 1 of 2021 you could only
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
serve group members located within that
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
municipality in henneker you couldn't
 
02:19:12.629 --> 02:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
say have a municipal host in henneker
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
and serve say a group of customers down
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
in where and forgive me i live in maine
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
so my sense of new hampshire geography
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
might be off um but um that's at least
 
02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
the way the language reads now
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
you know i know representative oxenham
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
asked about you know potentially
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
removing that language i'm not in a
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
position to articulate what would be the
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
impact of the removal of that language
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
today but it's certainly something i'd
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
be willing to follow up with the
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
committee on yeah
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up so so
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
the instance i'm thinking of is that if
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
there was a municipal host in
 
02:19:44.639 --> 02:19:45.669 align:start position:0%
there was a municipal host in
warner

02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
warner
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that's where my power is coming from
 
02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:50.309 align:start position:0%
and that's where my power is coming from
um

02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
what would that
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
do as far as
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
what i would know not be able to
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
participate what would happen i i just
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so if you're a municipal host
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
located in warner and you wanted to
 
02:20:04.399 --> 02:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
located in warner and you wanted to
serve

02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
serve
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh political subdivision and or uh
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
political subdivision entities as
 
02:20:12.790 --> 02:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
specified in the bill you could and
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
again came into operation after january
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
1 of 2021
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
you could only serve those types of
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
entities within that same municipality
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
you couldn't you know extend beyond a
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
municipal border or anything like that
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
unless you were
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
prior to january 1 of 2021
 
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up last one so would
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
they have to like redistribute how i get
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
my power
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think my power comes from there
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
from warner you're saying right yeah
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
i have to
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
let me get back to you on that one
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
sure i'm sorry i apologize for that but
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh sorry i missed
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
heartless but i had to testify in the
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
senate um going to the bill that talks
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
about quasi public entity
 
02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:07.670 align:start position:0%
about quasi public entity
um

02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
as far as that i guess that would mean
 
02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
the university system of new hampshire
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
so circling back to uh kelly buchanan's
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
testimony there were two bills in the
 
02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
senate uh senate bill 259 that you have
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
in front of you and senate bill 370
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
which was senator perkins quocus both of
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
them sought to include new language in
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
the political subdivision
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
um definition in this statute
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
her bill at senator
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
perkins cuoco's bill as introduced would
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
have inserted
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
ccsnh and its components the university
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire and its
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
components in any state entity
 
02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
have one bill rather than two is that
 
02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:52.309 align:start position:0%
have one bill rather than two is that
they

02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
put the focus of both bills onto this
 
02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:55.510 align:start position:0%
put the focus of both bills onto this
bill

02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
but they changed the phrase to
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
quasi-public entity i don't know
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
again one of the things the department
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise is that
 
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
that phrase isn't defined in state
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
statute so it's rather ambiguous so we
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
welcome additional clarity on that okay
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
well thank you that's i i didn't know
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
what it meant either that's why i asked
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
the question but
 
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
on a broader question and and you may
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
may not be able to answer this but i'm
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
trying to look at this and say
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
this is really a huge ex possible
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
expansion because if we're bringing in
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
entities like the university of new
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the pease development
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
authority they have a very large
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
electric load is there anything
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
in this will prevent them from putting
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
up say i don't know
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
four or five uh four and a half megawatt
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh solar generators and uh
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
using them as net metering forgive me
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you said four or five
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
megawatts i'm sorry yeah less than five
 
02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah less than five but the
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
universities new hampshire could have
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
like four of them sure i don't think
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
anything would preclude them from doing
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
so obviously the the
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
tariff for the the
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
the credit mechanism they would receive
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
for the power that they could put back
 
02:23:03.429 --> 02:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
on the grid would be entirely different
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
under this uh you can group net meter
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
above net one megawatt if you're a
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
municipal host based on the language but
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you're just a private entity um that
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
wants a net meter above one megawatt you
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
can but you're not going to be open to
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
the current net metering tariff all
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
i have a question uh just out of
 
02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:24.309 align:start position:0%
i have a question uh just out of
curiosity

02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
curiosity
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
since the inception of hb 315
 
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
have we
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
given it enough time yet to see how it's
 
02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:32.870 align:start position:0%
given it enough time yet to see how it's
working

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
i i can uh thank you for the question
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative again um you know since
 
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
the bill has been signed into law the
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
department again has registered just
 
02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
four municipal hosts in the state and
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
all four hydroelectric facilities
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
again located in gorham berlin
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
hillsborough and milton
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for the future of of a
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
municipal host it's obviously as the
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
applications come in and are vetted by
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the department and approved
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
i did check with
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
a member of the staff today and i'm not
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
aware of any currently pending
 
02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:04.950 align:start position:0%
aware of any currently pending
applications

02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
applications
 
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay i was just getting trying to get a
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
before we
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
add more to
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
what would be had been 315
 
02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
to have an idea of how 50 315 was
 
02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:17.990 align:start position:0%
to have an idea of how 50 315 was
working

02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
the vder report will that cover that
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
area and
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
also when do you think that report will
 
02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
be released so i'll answer the second
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
last the report will be released is
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
expected to be released late spring of
 
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
this year um and will the vdr study look
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly at municipal hosts
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
i couldn't speak to that again i'm not
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
involved in the day-to-day but again
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
it'll look at the value of distributed
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
energy resources holistically in the
 
02:24:45.359 --> 02:24:47.110 align:start position:0%
energy resources holistically in the
state

02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
i get just for clarification when you
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
say late spring it'll be really sometime
 
02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:53.270 align:start position:0%
say late spring it'll be really sometime
after

02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
the middle of april
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
i would say so correct yes
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you for
 
02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you anybody else
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
speaking desire for this bill
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will ask representative
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%

hampshire over the past three years we
have

have
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
built roughly seven one megawatt

projects throughout the state
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
with our development partner gssg solar
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
the comment that i wanted to make was
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
directly regarding that question about
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
the effect of 315 and the
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation that representative
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
oxenham had made
 
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
as we look forward into
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
the expansion of the municipal bill here
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
we currently have a project located
 
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
planned for
 
02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:57.670 align:start position:0%
planned for
the

02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
landfill cap landfill in laconia
 
02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:01.750 align:start position:0%
landfill cap landfill in laconia
in

02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
meeting the requirements of the
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
municipal bill uh hp 315
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
we are currently laying constrained
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
there maximum we could build their uh
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
and get on the lines uh
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
working with eversource it's about 2.8
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
city of laconia has
 
02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:25.110 align:start position:0%
city of laconia has
committed

02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
committed
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
over a million kilowatt hours to their
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
hydro dams in the area
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
currently under the existing law
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
struggling to find enough off-take
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
within the city of the city boundaries
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the municipality of laconia to fill
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
out that project
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxfam's recommendation
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
of removing the line
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
a municipal host shall be located within
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
the same municipality as all group
 
02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:51.190 align:start position:0%
the same municipality as all group
members

02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
if that line was removed that would
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
allow us to go out to guilford to allow
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
us to go out to a number of different
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
in order to fill that out
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
second thing is that representative or
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
hp 315
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
is slanted towards the larger
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities here in the state
 
02:28:13.349 --> 02:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
that have the load that can serve these
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
larger projects however the land mass
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
is really represented by the smaller
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do not have the load
 
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
to participate in this program even if
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
and so my point there is that if
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
per representative ox
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation senator avard's agreement
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
about removing that line that would
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate that problem
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
it eliminates the issues where you have
 
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:44.950 align:start position:0%
it eliminates the issues where you have
multiple

02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
service territories in an area
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh that cross over municipal boundaries
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
and it also
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
evens the playing field
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
for the the smaller municipalities that
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
have the land that can be a municipal
 
02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:57.670 align:start position:0%
have the land that can be a municipal
host

02:28:57.670 --> 02:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
host
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
but they don't get the state offices
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
they don't get the uh
 
02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:03.030 align:start position:0%
they don't get the uh
the

02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:04.150 align:start position:0%
the
uh

02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
universities they don't get the
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
community colleges located in their
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
areas and therefore they don't get to
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
participate by removing that line
 
02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
now they can
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
that was my point
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
for mr fenner yes riverside
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you my question if there was a
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
cost shift to other ratepayers why would
 
02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
we want to expand
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
this this is a
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
as the governor likes this is a
 
02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:34.309 align:start position:0%
as the governor likes this is a
market-based

02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
market-based
 
02:29:36.389 --> 02:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity if the
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
towns elect to participate
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
as a municipal
 
02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.070 align:start position:0%
as a municipal
off-taker

02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
off-taker
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's their choice they don't have to
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
nobody's forcing them to this just
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity for them to
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
very similar to the community power law
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's a market-based mechanism which
 
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
we live in new hampshire live free or
 
02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:57.110 align:start position:0%
we live in new hampshire live free or
die

02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
die
 
02:29:57.120 --> 02:29:58.230 align:start position:0%
die
and

02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a market mechanism i
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you did you say
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
you were in the eversource territory
 
02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:09.750 align:start position:0%
you were in the eversource territory
um

02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
um

04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
testifying today
 
04:31:15.920 --> 04:31:17.750 align:start position:0%
testifying today
um

04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
but if we're trying to encourage people
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
to produce solar energy
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
and if they produce
 
04:31:28.080 --> 04:31:29.670 align:start position:0%
and if they produce
and

04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:29.680 --> 04:31:30.950 align:start position:0%
and
use

04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:31:34.149 --> 04:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
20 percent behind the meter
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
that difference between what they
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
produce and what they use
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
is a credit
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
and right now they get paid
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
once a year
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
they've made all this investment
 
04:31:48.000 --> 04:31:49.349 align:start position:0%
they've made all this investment
equipment

04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance on the equipment
 
04:31:52.000 --> 04:31:52.870 align:start position:0%
maintenance on the equipment
and

04:31:52.870 --> 04:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
they have to wait a whole year
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i felt that was
 
04:32:00.870 --> 04:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
unfair the original bill asked for the
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
payments to be monthly
 
04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
i said well let's back off of that a
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
little bit and try something a little
 
04:32:06.960 --> 04:32:07.910 align:start position:0%
little bit and try something a little
different

04:32:07.910 --> 04:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
so we settled on quarterly
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
and that's the bill you have in front of
 
04:32:12.399 --> 04:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
and that's the bill you have in front of
you

04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
the energy department will say well
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
because they called me up last night and
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
gave me a warning that it's in the wrong
 
04:32:21.040 --> 04:32:22.630 align:start position:0%
gave me a warning that it's in the wrong
statute

04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
we're in the wrong place that it only
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
affects this and that and the other
 
04:32:25.920 --> 04:32:26.950 align:start position:0%
affects this and that and the other
thing

04:32:26.950 --> 04:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:32:26.960 --> 04:32:28.309 align:start position:0%
thing
well

04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
at noon time today after my energy
 
04:32:30.720 --> 04:32:31.910 align:start position:0%
at noon time today after my energy
hearing

04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
i went over to ols and said go figure
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
out what the right statute is
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
so that we can make this and
 
04:32:42.309 --> 04:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
if we again we should be given these
 
04:32:42.319 --> 04:32:43.830 align:start position:0%
if we again we should be given these
payments

04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
payments
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
to these individuals at least quarterly
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
that there be an option for that
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you senator gray do we have
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator about this
 
04:32:59.120 --> 04:33:02.070 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator about this
bill

04:33:02.070 --> 04:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:33:05.830 --> 04:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
i have at least one and that is
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
what is your expectation for the
 
04:33:07.920 --> 04:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
what is your expectation for the
amendment

04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
right now since they haven't identified
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
i did ask the department of energy also
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
to look at what
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh statute they thought it should be in
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:33:25.510 --> 04:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
possibly by the end of today or the end
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the week i will have a better answer
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
for you of exactly where the statute
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know what the statute language
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that it hurts to leave
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
it in the statute that we have
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
because it deals with whether or not
 
04:33:47.029 --> 04:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
you're you're net metering
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
and mr
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
griffin roberts will
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
be able to speak more to that when the
 
04:33:55.990 --> 04:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:57.990 --> 04:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much senator
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
04:34:01.429 --> 04:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm just curious
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
other than
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
you believe it's the right thing to do
 
04:34:09.359 --> 04:34:11.189 align:start position:0%
you believe it's the right thing to do
what

04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
what is the benefit of making quarterly
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
payments um are are these people um
 
04:34:17.760 --> 04:34:18.709 align:start position:0%
payments um are are these people um
uh

04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
are they far behind in their bills do
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
they need the credits more frequently
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
and what does this do to the accounting
 
04:34:26.310 --> 04:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
for the utilities they have to make up
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
those credits i'm just wondering what
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
the background was on this well i'm not
 
04:34:32.551 --> 04:34:32.561 align:start position:0%
saying that they're far behind in their
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
bills or anything else i mean if they
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:41.109 --> 04:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
they want to produce the energy
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
and the equipment that they have
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
invested in produces
 
04:34:46.480 --> 04:34:47.830 align:start position:0%
invested in produces
70

04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
70
 
04:34:50.470 --> 04:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
or 70 percent more than what they need
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
so they're using 30 of that power behind
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
the meter
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
why should they have to wait a year
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
the bills that they get from the public
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
service company
 
04:35:00.719 --> 04:35:01.670 align:start position:0%
service company
show

04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
show
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
what the status is
 
04:35:04.561 --> 04:35:07.109 align:start position:0%
what the status is
the

04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
power companies said that it was going
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
to cost them a lot of money to do this
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
the senate committee was not
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
overly impressed by that
 
04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
especially because a lot of that plus
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and minus
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
is already on the bills but certainly
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
you should listen to them
 
04:35:24.799 --> 04:35:26.629 align:start position:0%
you should listen to them
but

04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
my answer to your question
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
in short terms would be fairness
 
04:35:33.830 --> 04:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
if you make an investment
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
to help out the environment to help out
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
your fellow citizens you know to provide
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
green energy
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
why should you have to wait a year
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you

representative flett is recognized for a
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you for taking
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
my question senator gray as you know
 
04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
solar is very variable and it may
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
produce a lot in july and august
 
04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
may produce very terribly in december in
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
january so
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
would to quarterly make the utility pay
 
04:36:06.390 --> 04:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of money one way and
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
some quarters and then beg it back in
 
04:36:11.189 --> 04:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
it may be that that very well could
 
04:36:13.760 --> 04:36:14.869 align:start position:0%
it may be that that very well could
happen

04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
depending on how they choose the
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
quarters depending on how different
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
things are going
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
but right now
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
is that the utility company is
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
if they owe you money is getting the
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
benefit of that
 
04:36:29.279 --> 04:36:30.551 align:start position:0%
benefit of that
for

04:36:30.551 --> 04:36:30.561 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
a number of months
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
and you get nothing
 
04:36:34.879 --> 04:36:38.230 align:start position:0%
and you get nothing
nothing

04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
you are making an interest-free loan to
 
04:36:40.561 --> 04:36:41.429 align:start position:0%
you are making an interest-free loan to
them

04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%

representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
04:36:47.119 --> 04:36:50.629 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
question

04:36:50.629 --> 04:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
i get it you want to go no
 
04:36:53.279 --> 04:36:54.629 align:start position:0%
i get it you want to go no
yeah

04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
um i i agree with you i think that it's
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
their money but um the question that i
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
have is that the language that's bolded
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
here says provided that the commission
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
requires the option of payment at least
 
04:37:07.920 --> 04:37:08.949 align:start position:0%
requires the option of payment at least
quarterly

04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
is it
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
is it
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh like a shoring up annually that
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
creates a check to the customer
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
and would we be talking about
 
04:37:18.639 --> 04:37:20.070 align:start position:0%
and would we be talking about
um

04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:20.080 --> 04:37:21.189 align:start position:0%
um
a

04:37:21.189 --> 04:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:37:24.230 --> 04:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
check four times a year or would we
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
want to ask them to
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
credit the bill for the amount that
 
04:37:28.959 --> 04:37:30.070 align:start position:0%
credit the bill for the amount that
they're

04:37:30.070 --> 04:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
in excess of i'm just wondering i think
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
you know uh for what it is we're
 
04:37:37.349 --> 04:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
what it is we're going to get if this
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill goes through whether it would make
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
more sense to ask for the shoring up to
 
04:37:41.520 --> 04:37:42.949 align:start position:0%
more sense to ask for the shoring up to
be

04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:37:45.670 --> 04:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
done through the bill if i am a business
 
04:37:45.680 --> 04:37:46.789 align:start position:0%
done through the bill if i am a business
person

04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:37:49.590 --> 04:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i invest in solar
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
and i know what my energy needs are
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
for the year
 
04:37:57.600 --> 04:37:58.709 align:start position:0%
for the year
okay

04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
or for any particular period
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
if i produce
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
and use the 20 behind the meter which is
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
required for certain things to kick in
 
04:38:09.920 --> 04:38:10.949 align:start position:0%
required for certain things to kick in
and

04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
my equipment produces much more
 
04:38:17.349 --> 04:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
then that more is what we're talking
 
04:38:17.359 --> 04:38:18.551 align:start position:0%
then that more is what we're talking
about

04:38:18.551 --> 04:38:18.561 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:38:18.561 --> 04:38:20.390 align:start position:0%
about
um

04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:20.400 --> 04:38:21.670 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
some of the technologies that are used
 
04:38:27.029 --> 04:38:27.039 align:start position:0%
have solar trackers on there which
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
instead of having a nice parabolic shape
 
04:38:31.279 --> 04:38:32.789 align:start position:0%
instead of having a nice parabolic shape
the

04:38:32.789 --> 04:38:32.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:35.590 --> 04:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
curve that you get out of it is more
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
flat on the top because the tracker can
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
can actually track the sun
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
and again so if you have invested
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
more money to get more energy
 
04:38:50.310 --> 04:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
but still meeting the requirement for
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
use behind the meter
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
why should you
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
not be the one who benefits from that
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
until the year is expired may i clarify
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead i don't think that was the
 
04:39:03.359 --> 04:39:04.310 align:start position:0%
go ahead i don't think that was the
question

04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
the question is that the bill calls for
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
the payment that comes annually to be
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
made in a quarterly basis and what i'm
 
04:39:13.109 --> 04:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
if the utility is already tracking the
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
plus that you're getting above your 20
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
or 30 percent that meets your needs
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
right behind the meter piece
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
if they're already tracking that excess
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
and they're planning to pay you for it
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to write the bill so
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
that it becomes a credit on your bill
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
quarterly it is right so it's not a
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
payment right it's a credit quarterly
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
what we want is for them to zero that
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
account out
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
on a quarterly basis
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
that some of these
 
04:39:45.200 --> 04:39:46.948 align:start position:0%
that some of these
individuals

04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
okay have
 
04:39:48.878 --> 04:39:51.030 align:start position:0%
okay have
a

04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:39:51.040 --> 04:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
a
net

04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
net
 
04:39:52.320 --> 04:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
net
energy

04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
a negative energy usage
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole year
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
because again the statute the way it is
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
is 20 behind the meter okay to qualify
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
for the the various things at the
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
certain power level
 
04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know it may not be
 
04:40:13.760 --> 04:40:14.628 align:start position:0%
you know it may not be
that

04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
a particular customer
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know real high on the
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
positive side in the summer and real
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
low on the negative side
 
04:40:27.750 --> 04:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the winter it may be that they're
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
producing power all year long but the
 
04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
way the statute is
 
04:40:34.628 --> 04:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
that right now the companies can do it
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
pay you annually
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the power company you should listen
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
to them when they come up they're going
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
to tell you that it's a manual process
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
because only a few people do this and
 
04:40:45.910 --> 04:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
then dan
 
04:40:45.920 --> 04:40:46.628 align:start position:0%
then dan
so

04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
again and i'm not saying that that's
 
04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
right wrong
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
but it's already on their bill
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
you can go look at the bills and you can
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
see the pluses and the minuses
 
04:40:58.080 --> 04:41:02.470 align:start position:0%
see the pluses and the minuses
and

04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.150 --> 04:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
wave it off
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative clausier is recognized
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
04:41:15.030 --> 04:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
i thank the chair and i thank you
 
04:41:20.230 --> 04:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:20.240 --> 04:41:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:41:25.990 --> 04:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.470 --> 04:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the pause
 
04:41:30.390 --> 04:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh center great um
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
what i just want to clarify
 
04:41:32.798 --> 04:41:33.750 align:start position:0%
what i just want to clarify
when

04:41:33.750 --> 04:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
a person puts up
 
04:41:37.510 --> 04:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
this array
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
knowing they
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
are have a raid that's going to deliver
 
04:41:42.160 --> 04:41:43.110 align:start position:0%
are have a raid that's going to deliver
more

04:41:43.110 --> 04:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:41:43.120 --> 04:41:43.910 align:start position:0%
more
they

04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:41:45.510 --> 04:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
must have
 
04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
had that capital
 
04:41:47.360 --> 04:41:48.788 align:start position:0%
had that capital
and

04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:48.798 --> 04:41:49.830 align:start position:0%
and
already

04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:41:49.840 --> 04:41:50.708 align:start position:0%
already
paid

04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
paid
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
knowing they were going to get their
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
payment a year now
 
04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
and that's the question if you could
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
just clarify
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
they knew they were going to take a year
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
to get their
 
04:42:01.600 --> 04:42:03.430 align:start position:0%
to get their
credit

04:42:03.430 --> 04:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
credit
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
i agree that
 
04:42:07.590 --> 04:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases they knew
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean it's just it
 
04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's fair and that's why my
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
phone does ring on a lot of different
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
issues is because they're neither just
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:23.110 --> 04:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any further questions
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
for senator gray representative partial
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair vows and thank you for
 
04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
your testimony today
 
04:42:31.350 --> 04:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
um one thing which i'm looking at i'm
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
looking at the uh
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
bill itself except it's provided in
 
04:42:37.510 --> 04:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph five the customer generator
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
may elect to be paid or credited
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
by the electric distribution utility for
 
04:42:42.958 --> 04:42:43.830 align:start position:0%
by the electric distribution utility for
its

04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
its
 
04:42:45.510 --> 04:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
i mean that seems to imply that it does
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
not have to be a direct payment but a
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
credit i don't know if the answer is a
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
question somebody had earlier i don't
 
04:42:50.638 --> 04:42:51.350 align:start position:0%
question somebody had earlier i don't
but

04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:42:53.830 --> 04:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
my more specific question would be
 
04:42:53.840 --> 04:42:56.150 align:start position:0%
my more specific question would be
um

04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:58.948 --> 04:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the cost of money
 
04:43:01.110 --> 04:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
and i know with my electric bill if i
 
04:43:03.750 --> 04:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
don't pay my bill promptly uh there's
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
what one point five percent uh monthly
 
04:43:07.040 --> 04:43:08.628 align:start position:0%
what one point five percent uh monthly
um

04:43:08.628 --> 04:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
this we're talking about
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
the cost of capital here and would it
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
make more sense for a bill like this to
 
04:43:16.000 --> 04:43:16.708 align:start position:0%
make more sense for a bill like this to
be

04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:43:20.788 --> 04:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
worked out monthly rather than quarterly
 
04:43:20.798 --> 04:43:21.910 align:start position:0%
worked out monthly rather than quarterly
the

04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
way the bill is written
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
that would certainly be an option
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
that could be available
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
we got pushback from the company when we
 
04:43:32.638 --> 04:43:33.590 align:start position:0%
we got pushback from the company when we
went

04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
went
 
04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
any less than annually
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
because they did testify that they did
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
it on an annual basis
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
and to do it monthly that would be
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with me that is what my
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
constituent asked for
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
i thought that going from annually
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
right to monthly
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
with the expenses that the power
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
companies were saying that they had to
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
do this
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
and that a compromise doing it quarterly
 
04:44:04.080 --> 04:44:06.310 align:start position:0%
and that a compromise doing it quarterly
was

04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
what i thought was a reasonable
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
compromise and you talked about the cost
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
of money well the problem
 
04:44:15.510 --> 04:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
that i would have if i invested in one
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
of these is that the bill for the
 
04:44:18.240 --> 04:44:19.430 align:start position:0%
of these is that the bill for the
equipment

04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
probably is going to come in monthly
 
04:44:24.868 --> 04:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
okay and so it's not just the cost of
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
the money it's cash flow also
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
is that if i have to wait a whole year
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
to get back the cash so that i can pay
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
for the equipment
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
that that seemed to me to go back to the
 
04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
fairness that i was talking about before
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative partial yes thank you for
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
the follow-up
 
04:44:48.070 --> 04:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
um would it make
 
04:44:50.230 --> 04:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
big sense in a way if you did were if
 
04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
they insist on paying quarterly or
 
04:44:52.240 --> 04:44:53.190 align:start position:0%
they insist on paying quarterly or
yearly

04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
yearly
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
to charge them the same rate of interest
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
that they charge the customer for for uh
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
payments would that make any sense in a
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
situation like that
 
04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
myself personally is that if we put in
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
the statute that they have to be paid
 
04:45:08.160 --> 04:45:09.430 align:start position:0%
the statute that they have to be paid
quarterly

04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
and with the interest rates the way they
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
are right now it would not be worth
 
04:45:16.948 --> 04:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
our time to put it in law and it would
 
04:45:19.510 --> 04:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
not be there worth their time
 
04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
i just pointed out to my wife
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
that her account that has uh several
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and it earned 80 cents
 
04:45:30.628 --> 04:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
worth of interest last year uh that i
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
didn't even have to report to the irs so
 
04:45:35.350 --> 04:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think it's going to be
 
04:45:38.470 --> 04:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
worth their time
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
good point thank you
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you senator for bringing this
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill to uh to us this afternoon

representative harrington
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
um i will disclose that i had the
 
04:46:12.310 --> 04:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to serve in the new
 
04:46:14.868 --> 04:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire house for four years actually
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%

04:46:16.320 --> 04:46:17.670 align:start position:0%
senator parent and i represented the
same

04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
big conglomerate district back then um
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i just want to start by saying thank
 
04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
you all of you for serving the state
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
i recognize the time commitment that you
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
put into these issues for citizens here
 
04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and i truly appreciate
 
04:46:34.230 --> 04:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
the thoughtful questions that i just saw
 
04:46:36.628 --> 04:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
in your time on these issues
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad that i come in and just
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
sort of like to talk to people so
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
i really want to answer some of the
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions and some of the confusion and
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
the first thing i'll start with is that
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is a different technology than what
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know about solar or what you
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
understand about solar so i have these
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
flyers that i'd like to just
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.030 --> 04:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
and could you tell us who you represent
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
i represent myself sir
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
i'm the
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
father of my children the husband and my
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
wife and the
 
04:47:11.190 --> 04:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur of my businesses i own
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
six or seven small businesses here in
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
and that's really what led me into doing
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
solar power
 
04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
i own four car washes five storage
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
locations some commercial real estate
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and i'm a serial entrepreneur real
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
estate brokerage firm
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
the local rental store in my hometown of
 
04:47:28.320 --> 04:47:29.590 align:start position:0%
the local rental store in my hometown of
farmington

04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
farmington
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i still very much consider myself
 
04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
just a small business a blue-collar
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur these are all service type
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
type businesses
 
04:47:40.470 --> 04:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the the thing this business has all
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
those businesses have in common is an
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
incredibly high when you look at an
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
international level cost of electricity
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
for these businesses
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
it continues to go up and recently went
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
up uh a double-digit increase just last
 
04:47:53.040 --> 04:47:54.550 align:start position:0%
up uh a double-digit increase just last
month

04:47:54.550 --> 04:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
we have what i consider to be
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
a problem in new hampshire with the cost
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
of electricity and we have a problem
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we don't promote distributed solar
 
04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
so as a
 
04:48:06.310 --> 04:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
not to be political but a conservative
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
republican from farmington i support
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
solar not just because it's clean and
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
green and i have asthma and i want to
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
bring breathe clean air that's certainly
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
very important but i really support this
 
04:48:19.510 --> 04:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
type of solar
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
dual access trackers because it empowers
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
people to have distributed energy behind
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
the meter and to be in the live free or
 
04:48:29.110 --> 04:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
die state in control of their power
 
04:48:31.590 --> 04:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
their power generation this is not just
 
04:48:33.270 --> 04:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
about me this is about every car
 
04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
dealership every oil company every
 
04:48:38.070 --> 04:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility every car wash
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
every storage facility and even
 
04:48:41.600 --> 04:48:43.270 align:start position:0%
every storage facility and even
um

04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know mrs moffitt who owns a mobile
 
04:48:46.550 --> 04:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
home and sacks mobile home park and she
 
04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
can't afford solar because she only has
 
04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
an 80 a month bill that she can't afford
 
04:48:51.750 --> 04:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
so to answer your very first question
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
why do we need to be paid really monthly
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
is what i asked for
 
04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the credit is already issued on the
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
bill every month
 
04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
you you produce surplus electricity you
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
get a credit on your bill and it says
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
hey i'm negative 72.
 
04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
so if mrs moffett wants a 24-panel
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
tracker it's not like you think of as
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
solar it's not like hey we're going to
 
04:49:15.750 --> 04:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
put eight panels south facing or 15
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
panels over here you get a 24 panel dual
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
axis tracker it's making 20 000
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
kilowatts a year that's what it makes so
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
it is it's like kind of having like a
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
20kw generator in your backyard except
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
it's solar
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
so it's in in the graph is very
 
04:49:33.430 --> 04:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
square like that close encounter the
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
third kind thing so in the morning at
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
six o'clock at night at seven o'clock at
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
night it's still making the same amount
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
of power is making it eight a.m you
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't have that that class like 11 to 1
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
peak of solar with this technology
 
04:49:47.430 --> 04:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
you also
 
04:49:48.788 --> 04:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
have very
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
consistent power throughout the year yes
 
04:49:53.190 --> 04:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
you get a little bit less in february
 
04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
and in january but these things dump the
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
snow they don't shut off for six weeks
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
in the winter and not produce any power
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
they lay flat when there's a wind storm
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
they turn and they track the sun all day
 
04:50:06.070 --> 04:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
long this technology makes solar power
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the solar panel
 
04:50:10.470 --> 04:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
on both sides
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
could you speak to the bill yes well to
 
04:50:14.948 --> 04:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
speak to the bill the reason you need to
 
04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
be paid monthly or quarterly was the
 
04:50:19.910 --> 04:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
compromise is that you need to be paid
 
04:50:21.350 --> 04:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
for that certain amount of kilowatts
 
04:50:23.430 --> 04:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
that you generate that you can't wait a
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
year for that credit to come in
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
because the customers often do have a
 
04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
loan and they want to get do solar but
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to do just eight
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
panels on the roof but they could do a
 
04:50:36.550 --> 04:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
24 panel tracker and have it make
 
04:50:38.070 --> 04:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
economic sense
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't change the cost it
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't create cost shifting it doesn't
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
push up against any of the rules and
 
04:50:47.910 --> 04:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
regulations that we have i don't i think
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't even be a net metering
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
bill this should be a fair payment bill
 
04:50:54.550 --> 04:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
and and you know the history of the of
 
04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
the bill and why i'm here
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
is the law said they'll set up a
 
04:51:00.550 --> 04:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable time for payment so honestly
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
i invested in some solar thinking i
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
would be paid in a reasonable time frame
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
i really didn't think that in rule
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
making and
 
04:51:07.440 --> 04:51:08.550 align:start position:0%
making and
section

04:51:08.550 --> 04:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
504 b of 903 800 page document there'd
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
be a rule that said oh reasonable time
 
04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
frame is one year that's not reasonable
 
04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
do you get your retirement check once a
 
04:51:21.910 --> 04:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
year do you pay check once a year
 
04:51:23.270 --> 04:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
do you play the plumber once a year do
 
04:51:24.550 --> 04:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
you make your car payment your mortgage
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
payment or your power bill once a year
 
04:51:27.270 --> 04:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
of course not
 
04:51:29.590 --> 04:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
so this is a very reasonable request
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we simply say that at least
 
04:51:34.550 --> 04:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
quarterly and you know typical of of
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
that my experience in the new hampshire
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
house for four years i passed a lot of
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
legislation i know that things get
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
weight to the last minute
 
04:51:42.868 --> 04:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
but the department of energy had my
 
04:51:44.788 --> 04:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
request for a rule waiver
 
04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
and under the under the law the rule
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
waiver was was very clear you shall
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
grant this rule waiver if it doesn't
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
hurt anybody
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
there was no finding that it caused any
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
problem there was no finding a cost
 
04:51:56.310 --> 04:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
utility any problem i mean to say that
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
utility can't pay this negative bill
 
04:51:58.160 --> 04:51:59.270 align:start position:0%
utility can't pay this negative bill
monthly

04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
is respectfully
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
not a fair statement for anyone to say
 
04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
utilities pay hundreds and thousands you
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
know tons of employees they pay they
 
04:52:10.868 --> 04:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
issue bills to all their customers they
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
cut checks to for every vendor that they
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
pay stuff for and they pay right now
 
04:52:17.830 --> 04:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
just eversource for instance pays
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
monthly to to 250 to 300
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
group hosts or community solar projects
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
they already have a system where they
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
cut those checks monthly if you're a
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
group host
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
the problem is if you have a 24 panel
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
tracker or a 48 panel tracker and it's
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
less than 100 kilowatts you can't afford
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
to go set up and be a group host
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
to just get that extra 100 bucks a month
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
but if you're an individual homeowner a
 
04:52:43.510 --> 04:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
mobile home and you can get eighty
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
dollars a month and now you don't have
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
an eighty dollar bill and you have
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
eighty dollars in income you can now
 
04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
participate in solar in a way that you
 
04:52:51.990 --> 04:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't participate before so what i
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
found out at the encouragement of my
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
local planning board hey you do storage
 
04:52:56.400 --> 04:52:57.190 align:start position:0%
local planning board hey you do storage
we

04:52:57.190 --> 04:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
have an ordinance that we want solar on
 
04:53:01.270 --> 04:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
these storage buildings
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
so i said oh gee the state lets me build
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
a 100 kilowatt system
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
get that metering
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
do my math
 
04:53:11.670 --> 04:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
not bad i'll i need some tax credits
 
04:53:13.590 --> 04:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
i'll build this thing so i went out and
 
04:53:15.190 --> 04:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
built them in multiple locations they're
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
now coming online
 
04:53:19.990 --> 04:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh my first one came online actually two
 
04:53:21.430 --> 04:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
and a half weeks ago
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
and from the fourteenth the end of the
 
04:53:24.550 --> 04:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
month we made ten thousand nine hundred
 
04:53:24.560 --> 04:53:26.390 align:start position:0%
month we made ten thousand nine hundred
kilowatts

04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
kilowatts
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
it's pretty significant what this can do
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
and it makes it join the time of the day
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
when power is being demanded
 
04:53:34.628 --> 04:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
the other big thing about the reason you
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
need this bill is you have to over
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
produce your salat supply side you have
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
to produce 130 percent whatever your
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
supply is because the 50 percent of your
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill is the demand side so in my car
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
washes if i can't over produce and get
 
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
that credit i can't bring the demand
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
side down
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
and everyone talks about cost shifting
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
when they talk about solar i don't want
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
to revisit that whole argument but i
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
want to stress this a different
 
04:53:57.760 --> 04:53:58.948 align:start position:0%
want to stress this a different
technology

04:53:58.948 --> 04:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that if you can offset your demand
 
04:54:03.510 --> 04:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
charges not just your supplies charge by
 
04:54:03.520 --> 04:54:04.310 align:start position:0%
charges not just your supplies charge by
over

04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
producing what you need you will lower
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
the peak demand for everybody on the
 
04:54:09.040 --> 04:54:10.150 align:start position:0%
the peak demand for everybody on the
grid

04:54:10.150 --> 04:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
grid
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
this is the first time i can come to you
 
04:54:13.030 --> 04:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
and say if you i don't think i can
 
04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
reverse the trend of energy costing more
 
04:54:16.708 --> 04:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
and more and more and i don't think
 
04:54:18.310 --> 04:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
anybody in this room or in this in this
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
state probably in this planet thinks
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
that utility costs are going down
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
but i tell you if we have widespread
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
adoption of solar tracker technology we
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
can at least stop that double-digit
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
increase because we can literally lessen
 
04:54:33.750 --> 04:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
the demand on the grid
 
04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
so it's a fundamentally different
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
technology than what you're used to
 
04:54:39.628 --> 04:54:39.638 align:start position:0%
i have now built
 
04:54:43.510 --> 04:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
737 kilowatts of solar trackers i have
 
04:54:43.520 --> 04:54:44.788 align:start position:0%
737 kilowatts of solar trackers i have
kilowatts

04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
kilowatts
 
04:54:46.868 --> 04:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
of 47 trackers deployed and properties
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
that i own
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i did this in good faith
 
04:54:52.470 --> 04:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
based on being paid in a reasonable time
 
04:54:52.480 --> 04:54:53.590 align:start position:0%
based on being paid in a reasonable time
frame

04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
frame
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that i reasonably should be
 
04:54:57.990 --> 04:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
paid and i would support an amendment
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
from this committee to do it monthly
 
04:55:02.708 --> 04:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
and i would ask you to eversource makes
 
04:55:04.310 --> 04:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
the credit monthly they make the
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
calculation of what the negative amount
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
is monthly it's on my bill
 
04:55:13.270 --> 04:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that testimony
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
04:55:19.350 --> 04:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you for taking
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
my question would you support a charge
 
04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
to you for the extra cost of doing it
 
04:55:25.990 --> 04:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
quarterly or monthly
 
04:55:27.910 --> 04:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's a way to quantify
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
that charge and to be to be frank i
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the eversource
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay me when i cut them 25 checks
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
04:55:44.868 --> 04:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.030 --> 04:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
something i'm curious about now you're
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
you consider these small businesses
 
04:55:48.798 --> 04:55:52.070 align:start position:0%
you consider these small businesses
correct

04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.080 --> 04:55:52.868 align:start position:0%
 
what

04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:55:55.030 --> 04:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
do you know what the amount is that
 
04:55:57.270 --> 04:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
would be due you
 
04:55:57.280 --> 04:55:58.708 align:start position:0%
would be due you
monthly

04:55:58.708 --> 04:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
on a
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
on one of your small businesses
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:56:06.550 --> 04:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
is that in line with what's trued up at
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
i want to answer this honestly as i can
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
certainly when they give you the credit
 
04:56:19.110 --> 04:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
you might get less of a credit in
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
january and february march
 
04:56:21.520 --> 04:56:22.470 align:start position:0%
january and february march
so

04:56:22.470 --> 04:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
if you waited the whole year and say you
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
had a month where you didn't get a
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
credit and there would be months where
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't get a credit you just
 
04:56:29.350 --> 04:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they wouldn't have to cut a
 
04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
check i don't know
 
04:56:32.708 --> 04:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
some systems it depends on the
 
04:56:32.718 --> 04:56:33.910 align:start position:0%
some systems it depends on the
consumption

04:56:33.910 --> 04:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
but you have a very narrow amount of
 
04:56:38.230 --> 04:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
power you can put out there now you can
 
04:56:40.390 --> 04:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
only do up to 100 kilowatts ac and get
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
net metering there is no net metering
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
beyond 100 credit routes in in new
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think that's wrong but
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's the law
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
so i have businesses that use way more
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
than 100 kilowatt system can produce
 
04:56:54.628 --> 04:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
so in those cases i probably wouldn't
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
get a credit so it wouldn't matter but
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
in other businesses where i need to
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
overpower the demand charges like car
 
04:57:04.628 --> 04:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:06.708 --> 04:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
but it is a principle thing i mean a
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
utility can go in and make a rule a
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
government organization can tell me that
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
rule has the full force of law that's
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
what they told me
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
and i said okay well i'll ask someone to
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
change the law i've done that before and
 
04:57:20.948 --> 04:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
i think that we should change the law
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
when government agencies are creating
 
04:57:23.120 --> 04:57:24.230 align:start position:0%
when government agencies are creating
law

04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:57:26.550 --> 04:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
based on a statute that didn't give them
 
04:57:28.550 --> 04:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
the authority to say annually if anyone
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
thinks annually is reasonable for
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
getting any type of payment then
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know tell me tough
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
but if you think it's reasonable to get
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
paid monthly or quarterly
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
i supported the amendment to quarterly
 
04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
because that's how you get paid s-rex
 
04:57:45.910 --> 04:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
and solar is quarterly so a lot of solar
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
investments understand that they're
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
going to get their payments quarterly
 
04:57:51.270 --> 04:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
you can still get financing from a bank
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you're getting paid quarterly you
 
04:57:54.948 --> 04:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
can't really get financing hello lender
 
04:57:57.350 --> 04:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to loan me 150 000 to build
 
04:57:59.190 --> 04:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
it you know some solar trackers can i
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
pay you once a year
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's not right so so in essence you've
 
04:58:03.360 --> 04:58:04.868 align:start position:0%
that's not right so so in essence you've
handicapped

04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
handicapped
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent of the law
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
and you've done that through rulemaking
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
to prevent people from being fared and
 
04:58:14.708 --> 04:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
paid in a reasonable time frame and i i
 
04:58:16.550 --> 04:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
find that wrong
 
04:58:18.550 --> 04:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i hope that this committee will find
 
04:58:20.708 --> 04:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
it wrong and fix that so that more
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
people can get bank loans so that people
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
who don't have a lot of power can get
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
solar trackers so that small businesses
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire can benefit from the
 
04:58:30.150 --> 04:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
law the way it was intended
 
04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:39.990 --> 04:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to follow up because
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your answer and it
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
clarifies some things but the other
 
04:58:47.110 --> 04:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
thing i i wanted to know was what is
 
04:58:47.120 --> 04:58:48.550 align:start position:0%
thing i i wanted to know was what is
your

04:58:48.550 --> 04:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:58:50.470 --> 04:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
average payment
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
per month so when you if you would now
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
in one of your small businesses
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
get back a check
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
what would it be would it be a hundred
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
would it be a thousand would it be fifty
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about
 
04:59:06.948 --> 04:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh my current largest bill is about
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
thirty four hundred dollars a month and
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
i don't have solar on it if i put 100
 
04:59:13.590 --> 04:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
kilowatt system on that it would barely
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
cover that bill so you wouldn't really
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
get a big amount back
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
but if you look at some of my projects
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
where i only have an 80 a month bill
 
04:59:23.430 --> 04:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
then yeah it could be
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know 20 grand a year a couple grand
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
a month
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
on 100 kilowatt system but it would
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
again vary based on the consumption
 
04:59:34.868 --> 04:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
behind the meter but the system is going
 
04:59:36.550 --> 04:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
to be the same size it's either going to
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
be one track or two 48 panel trackers
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i think is is worth
 
04:59:44.230 --> 04:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
mentioning is that the technology still
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
has to be tied into a meter so if you
 
04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
have three phase 408 400 amp service the
 
04:59:51.990 --> 04:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
biggest system you can put on is 150
 
04:59:54.390 --> 04:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
kilowatts if you have a single phase 200
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
amp service the biggest system you can
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
put on it is about 12 kilowatts
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
so you're not talking about
 
05:00:02.550 --> 05:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
fundamentally changing anything because
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
the technology is limited by the
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
electrical infrastructure of either the
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
house or the small business so for
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
instance we have a family dollar
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
building that's a storage facility the
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
most we can put in that is 83 kilowatts
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
that bill on average is about 400 a
 
05:00:19.590 --> 05:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
month so on that particular thing we
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
would get rid of the 400 a month bill we
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
would get rid of the demand charges and
 
05:00:25.270 --> 05:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
eversource would get to keep probably a
 
05:00:26.948 --> 05:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month for me because
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
it would only be an 83 kilowatt system
 
05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
but in order for me to finance that 83
 
05:00:34.230 --> 05:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
kilowatt system and do what the statute
 
05:00:36.150 --> 05:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
asked me to do
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
the state law says please go out and
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
build solar we'll do these net metering
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
rules we'll pay you these amounts of
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
money if you build these on your
 
05:00:43.040 --> 05:00:44.390 align:start position:0%
money if you build these on your
businesses

05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
so either you're dismantling the intent
 
05:00:48.550 --> 05:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the statute which is what this bill
 
05:00:48.560 --> 05:00:49.430 align:start position:0%
of the statute which is what this bill
does

05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:00:50.788 --> 05:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
and then we find out at the last minute
 
05:00:53.190 --> 05:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're in the wrong spot after a year of
 
05:00:54.868 --> 05:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
asking for a rule waiver and sending
 
05:00:56.550 --> 05:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
letters and doing this and explaining
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
the issue asking doing zoom calls with
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
the agency and saying hey where should
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
we fix this in statute
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't i'm not mad at anybody
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
here i'm just saying does that seem like
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
a problem with our system if you find
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
out the day you come in for the hearing
 
05:01:13.350 --> 05:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
that it's in the wrong spot so hopefully
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
we can do an amendment and not have that
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
be the little bit of confusion
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
that i see created a lot in new
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire house that says well gee we
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have done it but it
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the right spot sorry you know
 
05:01:26.948 --> 05:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
what i mean and i just i just i just
 
05:01:29.430 --> 05:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
feel it you know geez gosh we can't cut
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
checks monthly that'll cost us a million
 
05:01:31.200 --> 05:01:32.550 align:start position:0%
checks monthly that'll cost us a million
dollars

05:01:32.550 --> 05:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:01:33.910 --> 05:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
i can't believe someone said that with a
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
straight face
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
come on guys
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
utilities cut checks monthly all the
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
time it doesn't cost them extra money as
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
a small business owner i cut checks
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
monthly all the time it's the cost of
 
05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
doing business it's in the rate case
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing it for all the group hosts
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing it for all their customers
 
05:01:54.310 --> 05:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
this is no this is about as easy
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know a piece of legislation so i
 
05:01:59.110 --> 05:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
think we can pass hey rule makers
 
05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
you've got to pay them reasonables not
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
annually do it at least quarterly and
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
honestly if you keep that i'm going to
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
go to rulemaking and be sitting in the
 
05:02:08.470 --> 05:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
hearing waiving my negative bill that's
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
calculated monthly and hope that i can
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
persuade the department of energy to say
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's probably better if you
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
just pay it monthly they'll have that
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
option in rulemaking they just won't
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
have the option to make it annually so
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's why i think it's a fair a fair
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
compromise and i hope that you will
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
support whatever amendment senator gray
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
can figure out and hopefully the
 
05:02:31.350 --> 05:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
testimony we get from the agency will
 
05:02:33.190 --> 05:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
say oh we needed to be right here and we
 
05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
support it sorry we didn't mean to
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
prevent this new emerging this
 
05:02:39.750 --> 05:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
technology is two times better the
 
05:02:41.670 --> 05:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
reason i talk about the technology you
 
05:02:43.590 --> 05:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
can have a solar panel on a roof it's
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
gonna have a one-to-one ratio you have a
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
solar panel on a tracker it's gonna have
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
a two to one ratio okay let's uh get
 
05:02:51.510 --> 05:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
back to the bill if you would please
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a question
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:02:56.788 --> 05:02:56.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
actually there's a couple of technical
 
05:03:00.070 --> 05:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions on the bill
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
the wording says provided that the
 
05:03:04.150 --> 05:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
commission requires the option of
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
payment at least
 
05:03:08.948 --> 05:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
quarterly i'm assuming the intent here
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that option is held by the
 
05:03:14.550 --> 05:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
net meter and not the utility
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
and it's i'm directing this team um in
 
05:03:17.830 --> 05:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
the in the statute and i should have
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
addressed that in my testimony i
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
apologize you have the option to take a
 
05:03:21.840 --> 05:03:23.110 align:start position:0%
apologize you have the option to take a
credit

05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:03:24.868 --> 05:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
you have the option to carry the credit
 
05:03:24.878 --> 05:03:25.910 align:start position:0%
you have the option to carry the credit
forward

05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
or you have the option to ask for
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
payment once a year so even if you had
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
once a year and you had a credit it was
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
if it's less than a hundred dollars you
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
can't ask for the payment under statute
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
so you can only ask for the payment if
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's more than six hundred dollars so
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
because i have systems that are going to
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
be more than six hundred dollars on on
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
some months i'm asking for the payment
 
05:03:45.920 --> 05:03:46.948 align:start position:0%
some months i'm asking for the payment
monthly

05:03:46.948 --> 05:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
you'll follow up so it's optional
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure the option was
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
with the pain and so if i just two
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
points i'm trying to get to make sure i
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
understand your position you're saying
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
that the original law said pay in a
 
05:04:01.030 --> 05:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that was interpreted during real
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
rulemaking to be meaning pay once a year
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
and you would said that most solar loan
 
05:04:10.788 --> 05:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
payments are quarterly so that that
 
05:04:12.628 --> 05:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't line up with making your
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
payments when you get your check is that
 
05:04:14.718 --> 05:04:16.868 align:start position:0%
payments when you get your check is that
correct

05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:04:18.550 --> 05:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
most solar payments are monthly i
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have said quarterly i have had
 
05:04:20.400 --> 05:04:21.510 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have said quarterly i have had
banks

05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
banks
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
that when i told them about this
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation that it passed the
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
senate that have said we could deal with
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
quarterly payments if that ends up what
 
05:04:30.550 --> 05:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's being but typically if you're a
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
residential customer your your solar
 
05:04:34.150 --> 05:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
payment is monthly all right so that's
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why it should be monthly okay
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you just curious what's a 24 panel
 
05:04:44.070 --> 05:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
tracking system cost like that you
 
05:04:44.080 --> 05:04:45.510 align:start position:0%
tracking system cost like that you
installed

05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
installed
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
um we've been selling we have five
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
orders for them right now and they vary
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
from 39.5
 
05:04:53.590 --> 05:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
to 42.5
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
site circumstances distance from the
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
house so about 40 grand is what i would
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
say is the
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
um the average cost or investment that
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
someone would make and that would
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
typically get rid of their
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
additional questions for
 
05:05:17.670 --> 05:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
this representative mcgee
 
05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:05:20.400 --> 05:05:21.350 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds as though you're saying that
 
05:05:25.830 --> 05:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
the and i am i understand this from my
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
own you know research on the subject
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the tracking systems have a higher
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
capacity rate than a regular standard
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
array and do you have money money do you
 
05:05:37.350 --> 05:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
have information on the
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
capacity factors for these types of
 
05:05:41.270 --> 05:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
tracking arrays
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
how does it differ from like a
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
stationary array
 
05:05:44.240 --> 05:05:47.590 align:start position:0%
stationary array
um

05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
it differs from a stationary array in
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
that it makes power on both sides of the
 
05:05:51.520 --> 05:05:52.470 align:start position:0%
that it makes power on both sides of the
panel

05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
panel
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
it differs from even other types of
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
trackers on the market because it
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
actually has a light sensor and a
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
control board
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
that it'll sense the north-south light
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
the east-west light but does that result
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
in a higher capacity factor for the
 
05:06:04.878 --> 05:06:06.310 align:start position:0%
in a higher capacity factor for the
solar

05:06:06.310 --> 05:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
solar
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
think of it like a garden hose if you
 
05:06:09.430 --> 05:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
had a one-inch garden hose how fast is
 
05:06:11.910 --> 05:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
the water flowing kilowatt hours and
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
regular solar it flows fast from 11 to
 
05:06:14.080 --> 05:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
regular solar it flows fast from 11 to
1.

05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
1.
 
05:06:17.670 --> 05:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
on this solar it flows fast all day long
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
it flows fast in the winter time
 
05:06:21.030 --> 05:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing about the science of a
 
05:06:23.350 --> 05:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
solar panel is it produces more power
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
from 11 to 1 when the panel's at the
 
05:06:25.600 --> 05:06:26.628 align:start position:0%
from 11 to 1 when the panel's at the
right

05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
angle and elevation to the sun
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
so because these trackers are at the
 
05:06:32.310 --> 05:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
right angle and right elevation
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
adjusting in real time based on the
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
light sensors they produce more
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
throughout the day they produce on
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
cloudy days they produce on snowy days
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
they produce in the winter and because
 
05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is cold it's actually a
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
beautiful thing so in february we'll
 
05:06:49.190 --> 05:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
have days where we have record
 
05:06:49.200 --> 05:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
have days where we have record
production

05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
production
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
because it's cold and there's less heat
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's less loss
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
so that and because these trackers are
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
10 feet in the air they're dual use so
 
05:06:59.910 --> 05:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
the other public benefit here speaking
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the bill and paying monthly is that
 
05:07:03.830 --> 05:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
you can park cars under it you can have
 
05:07:05.830 --> 05:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
a blueberry farm a christmas tree farm
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
you can maintain your wildlife corridors
 
05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
you don't have solar brown fields you
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
don't have huge outside capital coming
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
in and exploiting our laws this is a
 
05:07:18.150 --> 05:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
very different technology and that's
 
05:07:18.160 --> 05:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
very different technology and that's
certainly

05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest reasons i'm trying to
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
impart to you why you should do this
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
and to get back to representative
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
harrington quickly the law right in
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
front of the change says reasonable
 
05:07:27.520 --> 05:07:28.868 align:start position:0%
front of the change says reasonable
conditions

05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
including the frequency of payment
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative thomas is recognized
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chair thank
 
05:07:38.230 --> 05:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:07:38.240 --> 05:07:39.270 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
um

05:07:39.270 --> 05:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:41.670 --> 05:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit confused uh you've
 
05:07:43.830 --> 05:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time
 
05:07:45.750 --> 05:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
not talking about the bill but spending
 
05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of time talking about your product
 
05:07:51.990 --> 05:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
does the bill that you want past
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
going to benefit
 
05:08:00.070 --> 05:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
your technology only or are you saying
 
05:08:00.080 --> 05:08:01.110 align:start position:0%
your technology only or are you saying
that

05:08:01.110 --> 05:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
all solar
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
products out there even the ones that
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
are inferior to yours
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
would also
 
05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
come under this law that you want passed
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
why you've spent so much time talking
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
about your technology
 
05:08:15.360 --> 05:08:16.628 align:start position:0%
about your technology
versus

05:08:16.628 --> 05:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
versus
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
the ordinary monthly payment of a bill
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
is there something about your technology
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
that demands
 
05:08:22.320 --> 05:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
that demands
a

05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
fair monthly payment as opposed to the
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
older type of solar technology
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question because it
 
05:08:32.470 --> 05:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
is something i meant to clarify this
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
would absolutely benefit all solar and
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
all solar technologies and the example
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
that i would give you is a lot of times
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
roof mount solar will they'll come and
 
05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
they'll say oh you need a five kilowatt
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
system that'll get rid of 60 of your
 
05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill this is what it will cost
 
05:08:49.910 --> 05:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
now in regular solar technology if
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
someone has a service that's big enough
 
05:08:54.070 --> 05:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
for say a 10 or a 15 or a 20 kilowatt
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
system the solar company could come in
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
and say hey we you you have a perfect
 
05:08:58.560 --> 05:08:59.430 align:start position:0%
and say hey we you you have a perfect
house

05:08:59.430 --> 05:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
south facing you have this feel we can
 
05:09:02.708 --> 05:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
do this ground mount we can do a 20
 
05:09:05.190 --> 05:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
kilowatt system you really only need
 
05:09:07.590 --> 05:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
five but we can do a 20 kilowatt system
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
and you can get a check each month from
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
the utility so why don't you buy a 20
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
kilowatt system so if you pass this law
 
05:09:16.550 --> 05:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
it would benefit all solar technology
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it would make it so that the people
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
who had the capital the ability to get a
 
05:09:19.920 --> 05:09:20.708 align:start position:0%
who had the capital the ability to get a
loan

05:09:20.708 --> 05:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
loan
 
05:09:22.868 --> 05:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
could get essentially a small community
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
solar project
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
right on their house and take care of
 
05:09:27.750 --> 05:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
their neighbor and their next neighbor
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
because the technology would benefit
 
05:09:31.830 --> 05:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
everyone because of distributed energy
 
05:09:33.510 --> 05:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
so if you have a 20 kilowatt system on
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
your neighbor's house and you don't have
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
any that electricity only goes from
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
point a to point b it doesn't go out in
 
05:09:42.550 --> 05:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
the grid and drive up to canada they
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
they no longer have to truck that power
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
all over the state they only have to
 
05:09:49.590 --> 05:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
bring it next door and they pay
 
05:09:51.910 --> 05:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know 13 cents to the guy who
 
05:09:54.150 --> 05:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
produces it they literally truck it next
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
door and they charge 22.
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
so there's a positive benefit to the
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
utilities because you're you don't get a
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
full credit when it's monetized so just
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
understand that this monetary credit is
 
05:10:08.788 --> 05:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
a portion of what a kilowatt cost and
 
05:10:10.470 --> 05:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
understand that utilities
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
don't make money on
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
transmitting kilowatts they don't make
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
money on that default service rate they
 
05:10:19.510 --> 05:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
make money by depreciating assets that
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
they build and put in the ground they
 
05:10:22.230 --> 05:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
put steel on the ground and they
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
depreciate it and they get a fixed rate
 
05:10:25.030 --> 05:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
of return
 
05:10:27.590 --> 05:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
they provide the cost
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
at supposedly their cost so
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
if they're only paying me 12 cents and
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're selling it for 22 cents i don't
 
05:10:36.628 --> 05:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
see how that's not a bad deal for them
 
05:10:38.788 --> 05:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
and and i and i and i think that maybe
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
we should ask them we actually have two
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
more people who want to testify no
 
05:10:42.480 --> 05:10:43.510 align:start position:0%
more people who want to testify no
problem

05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
uh a utility so yeah if it's okay with
 
05:10:48.868 --> 05:10:48.878 align:start position:0%
you we'll move on i would just reserve
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
the right if there's clarifications or
 
05:10:52.310 --> 05:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
other questions that come up i would
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
welcome the committee asking me back up
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
because it is a complex
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
issue representative thomas and it's
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
taken a long time
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
for me to understand kilowatt hour
 
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
versus kilowatt versus flow versus size
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
and they produce more because
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
they're producing all the time and i
 
05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
think the opportunity for people who can
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
afford it to oversize their system
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's something we should afford them
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
by paying them monthly for that we
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate your offer for your
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
your expertise
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
and we thank you for your testimony i'd
 
05:11:23.830 --> 05:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
like to call next on griffin robarge
 
05:11:34.550 --> 05:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh good afternoon uh griffin
 
05:11:39.670 --> 05:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
roberge from the new hampshire
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh here to provide testimony on senator
 
05:11:45.750 --> 05:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
gray's senate bill 261
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on the bill
 
05:11:52.550 --> 05:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
the statute that this bill would amend
 
05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
provides that when a customer generators
 
05:11:58.470 --> 05:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
net energy usage is negative i.e
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
more electricity is fed into the
 
05:12:02.550 --> 05:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
distribution system than is received
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
over a billing period then that customer
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
generator may elect to be paid or
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
credited by its utility
 
05:12:12.390 --> 05:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
for the excess generation at rates equal
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
to the utilities avoided costs as
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
determined by the puc
 
05:12:16.560 --> 05:12:17.670 align:start position:0%
determined by the puc
um

05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
the bill would require the puc to
 
05:12:20.948 --> 05:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
provide an option for such payment on a
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis when it determines the
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
frequency of payment required and
 
05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
obviously that's in the bold language on
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
lines eight to nine
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
as senator gray mentioned i did call him
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
late yesterday evening to let him know
 
05:12:32.798 --> 05:12:34.230 align:start position:0%
late yesterday evening to let him know
about

05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
some concerns we highlighted very late
 
05:12:38.070 --> 05:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
with the language but it is a technical
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
concern as it just may not be what
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
senator gray had intended
 
05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
as currently drafted the bill would only
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
apply to grandfathered customer
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
generators who were in service before
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
the alternative net metering tariff was
 
05:12:56.788 --> 05:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
adopted in the pucs june 2017 order
 
05:12:56.798 --> 05:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
adopted in the pucs june 2017 order
26029

05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
26029
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
it would only give those grandfathered
 
05:13:04.070 --> 05:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
customer generators the option to
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
receive quarterly payments at avoided
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
costs only so we're only looking at a
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
certain universe of customer generators
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
in effect the amendment appears in the
 
05:13:15.430 --> 05:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
wrong place in statute in view
 
05:13:17.430 --> 05:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
of what we believe to be the sponsor's
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
intended effect
 
05:13:21.510 --> 05:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
um the credit mechanism that existed
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
before the adoption of that of the net
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
of the alternative net metering tariff
 
05:13:28.948 --> 05:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
in the june 2017 order uh carried
 
05:13:31.510 --> 05:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
forward any excess kilowatt hours to be
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
applied as an offset
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
against future customer usage
 
05:13:39.510 --> 05:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
puc's order in june of 17 changed that
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour carryover credit to a
 
05:13:44.230 --> 05:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
monetary credit that has determined each
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
month that is carried forward as a bill
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
credit to subsequent months for new net
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
metered projects so at the end of the
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
year if a customer generator still has
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
any unused monetary credit balance then
 
05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
the customer generator reserves the
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
right to elect to be paid for the full
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
credit balance by its utility so on a
 
05:14:05.830 --> 05:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
yearly basis you can be paid out for
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
that excess credit under the new net
 
05:14:09.430 --> 05:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
metering tariff
 
05:14:12.150 --> 05:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
and just as background because i know
 
05:14:13.910 --> 05:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
we often come back discussing a lot of
 
05:14:15.750 --> 05:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
these net metering statutes
 
05:14:18.550 --> 05:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
many of these net metering provisions
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
set forth in statute have effectively
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
been superseded by puc proceedings and
 
05:14:26.070 --> 05:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
orders that were established by the
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
alternative net metering tariff i will
 
05:14:31.110 --> 05:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
point you specifically to rsa
 
05:14:31.120 --> 05:14:34.230 align:start position:0%
point you specifically to rsa
362-a

05:14:34.230 --> 05:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
colon 9
 
05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph 16 and if that helps it's xvi
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
that language in that statute gives the
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
commission the ability to waive
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
size limits requirements and that type
 
05:14:50.310 --> 05:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
of thing in certain areas of the net
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
metering statute which is effectively
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
what the puc did in its 2017
 
05:14:57.670 --> 05:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
alternative net metering order um so for
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
example language in another section of
 
05:15:01.590 --> 05:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
statute you know we'll be talking about
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
it in the next bill
 
05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
imposes caps on net on customer
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
generator capacity and utility service
 
05:15:08.080 --> 05:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
generator capacity and utility service
areas

05:15:09.030 --> 05:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply anymore because the pucz
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
always kind of superseded that
 
05:15:15.670 --> 05:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
again at the risk of having somebody
 
05:15:18.070 --> 05:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
throw something at me doe is has
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
retained a consultant to conduct a vdr
 
05:15:22.230 --> 05:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
study i'm just mentioning that again i
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
think you guys know my song and dance on
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
that one um but other than that more
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
than happy to take uh questions but just
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to at least explain what the doe
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
identified the bill as amended by the
 
05:15:32.400 --> 05:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
identified the bill as amended by the
senate

05:15:35.030 --> 05:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr roberge
 
05:15:37.360 --> 05:15:39.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr roberge
so

05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:43.350 --> 05:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
you stated in your testimony that a puc
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
order superseded what's in statute
 
05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct is that the root of the
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
comment in the
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
that says and i quote this would be a
 
05:15:55.750 --> 05:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
change from the current pu
 
05:15:58.390 --> 05:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
puc approved net metering tariff
 
05:15:58.400 --> 05:16:00.310 align:start position:0%
puc approved net metering tariff
provisions

05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
and would
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
permit certain renewable energy project
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
developers and other customer generators
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
to net meter without sharing the
 
05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
benefits of that net metering with group
 
05:16:12.310 --> 05:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
members i apologize representative you
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
said you are first off thank you for the
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
question are you reading from the fiscal
 
05:16:17.430 --> 05:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
note you said yes i'm sorry i have the
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
amended fiscal note as amended by the
 
05:16:21.430 --> 05:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
senate i unfortunately don't have the
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
original fiscal note which i think would
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
have applied to the bill as introduced
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
that would be reasonable to assume okay
 
05:16:32.948 --> 05:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i can't comment definitively
 
05:16:35.190 --> 05:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
on that um just because the bill was
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
drastically amended by the senate from
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
the as introduced version so i'm not
 
05:16:40.948 --> 05:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
sure to the extent that that might apply
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
so was there a fiscal note attached to
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh there was it i'll read
 
05:16:47.670 --> 05:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
it this bill requires utilities to pay a
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
customer generator at least quarterly
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
for the customer generators excess
 
05:16:52.948 --> 05:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
generation if the customer generator has
 
05:16:55.270 --> 05:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
elected the payment option the office of
 
05:16:56.708 --> 05:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance states
 
05:16:58.390 --> 05:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended by the senate has
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact on state county and
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
local expenditures or revenue
 
05:17:04.150 --> 05:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm more than willing to share a
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
copy of that amended fiscal note if
 
05:17:07.590 --> 05:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
needed thank you
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
will the department be providing what it
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
believes to be the correct statute to
 
05:17:14.948 --> 05:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
apply that is something we plan on uh
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
having conversations with senator gray
 
05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
about but at the time we spoke last
 
05:17:19.910 --> 05:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
night probably around six o'clock
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
senator gray i don't think i was in a
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
position to
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
iron out some language right then and
 
05:17:24.240 --> 05:17:25.590 align:start position:0%
iron out some language right then and
there

05:17:25.590 --> 05:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:33.110 --> 05:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm just trying to
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
get back to what you were stating there
 
05:17:40.788 --> 05:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
that says this would only apply to those
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh net meters in operation prior to june
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
of 2017 correct so
 
05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
what we just heard from
 
05:17:51.270 --> 05:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh mr campbell was he's talking about
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
newer units
 
05:17:56.070 --> 05:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
and if this bill was to go forward
 
05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
even with the corrections we're talking
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
about then the newer units that he was
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
referring to would still have the the
 
05:18:05.030 --> 05:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
same provision of they could get credit
 
05:18:06.310 --> 05:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
on their bill but if they wanted a
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
payment they would get paid at the end
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the year when it was trued up
 
05:18:11.110 --> 05:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
that's based on my discussions with
 
05:18:12.788 --> 05:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
department staff that is correct the way
 
05:18:13.910 --> 05:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
again and going back to my earlier
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
comments a lot of the statute that's in
 
05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
the net a lot of the net metering
 
05:18:21.750 --> 05:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
statute has been is effectively outdated
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
due to recent puc orders such as the
 
05:18:26.948 --> 05:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
order i'm referencing from 2017. based
 
05:18:28.868 --> 05:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
on the change that this makes it would
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
only apply to those customer generators
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
who were grandfathered in
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the alternative networking tariff um
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
before the order was issued in june of
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
17. follow up mr chan follow up
 
05:18:42.708 --> 05:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused having been both a
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislature and a puc commissioner i was
 
05:18:46.628 --> 05:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
always under the impression that the
 
05:18:49.830 --> 05:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
legislator trumped puc decisions no i
 
05:18:51.510 --> 05:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
understand that but again if you look at
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
the statute that i referenced rsa 362-8
 
05:18:57.990 --> 05:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
colon 9 paragraph 16 it does give the
 
05:19:00.550 --> 05:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
puc broad authority to kind of waive
 
05:19:02.150 --> 05:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
some of these requirements under
 
05:19:03.830 --> 05:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
proceedings and orders
 
05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
but you would agree that even if that's
 
05:19:10.470 --> 05:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
pertinent if we were to pass a new
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
statute that changed the requirements
 
05:19:15.190 --> 05:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
explicitly it would supersede anything
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the puc did i mean it could but i
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that we
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
recognized after the bill was in the
 
05:19:21.510 --> 05:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
senate was i think there was an
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
intention of the sponsor to apply to a
 
05:19:26.310 --> 05:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
certain universe of customer generators
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
we just want to be sure that's done
 
05:19:27.680 --> 05:19:28.708 align:start position:0%
we just want to be sure that's done
properly

05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
properly
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like from the previous
 
05:19:32.310 --> 05:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that what we were hearing from
 
05:19:34.390 --> 05:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
mr campbell was he was interested in
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
things that were built in the past he
 
05:19:37.510 --> 05:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be interested in thinking that
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
that was ours now and in the future that
 
05:19:41.590 --> 05:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
was our sense as well so that's one of
 
05:19:42.788 --> 05:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
the things we wanted to identify with
 
05:19:45.030 --> 05:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
senator gray and certainly you know have
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
conversations about potential language
 
05:19:49.990 --> 05:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.230 --> 05:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr robarge we appreciate
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony we have one more person
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
who would like to testify on this bill
 
05:19:57.990 --> 05:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and that's donna gamache
 
05:20:00.868 --> 05:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
from eversource
 
05:20:07.110 --> 05:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:08.948 --> 05:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much nice to see you this
 
05:20:11.190 --> 05:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record donna gamache
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
with eversource uh eversource2 is uh
 
05:20:16.550 --> 05:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
and our only ask is the same ask that we
 
05:20:21.510 --> 05:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
asked in the senate and it got lost
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
there but um so i'm just here to ask to
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
see if we could pick it up and give it
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
to us
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
regardless if
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
anybody believes that there is or isn't
 
05:20:32.788 --> 05:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
costs associated with making these
 
05:20:32.798 --> 05:20:34.788 align:start position:0%
costs associated with making these
changes

05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't matter if there are costs
 
05:20:39.830 --> 05:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
we would like to have cost recovery and
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
we would like cost recovery language and
 
05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
if as some people believe that there are
 
05:20:45.910 --> 05:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
no costs associated with it then we
 
05:20:47.990 --> 05:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
would not get cost recovery but we would
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
like we believe we i've chatted with our
 
05:20:52.868 --> 05:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
billing folks and it would there would
 
05:20:55.350 --> 05:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
be a cost incurred we're not saying that
 
05:20:57.190 --> 05:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
we want um to take a position on the
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
bill as a result of those costs we're
 
05:21:01.030 --> 05:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
just asking for cost recovery language
 
05:21:02.708 --> 05:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
which i can provide to the committee if
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
you decide to move forward with this
 
05:21:04.080 --> 05:21:04.948 align:start position:0%
you decide to move forward with this
bill

05:21:04.948 --> 05:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:21:07.270 --> 05:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
and only one other very quick um
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
statement um it was stated by
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
mr um campbell that
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
we purchased the power from somebody
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
who's producing a dis from a distributed
 
05:21:17.840 --> 05:21:18.868 align:start position:0%
who's producing a dis from a distributed
generated

05:21:18.868 --> 05:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
generated
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
facility at 12 cents and we sell it back
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
to our customers at 22. i just wanted to
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
clarify for this committee that that
 
05:21:27.350 --> 05:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
would never be allowed we do not do that
 
05:21:29.510 --> 05:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
and if we are selling power at 20 we're
 
05:21:32.470 --> 05:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
not selling power at 22 cents
 
05:21:34.470 --> 05:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
the energy piece is the energy piece
 
05:21:36.628 --> 05:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
that the puc determines is just and
 
05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable the difference that adds up
 
05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
to 22 is poles and wires transmission
 
05:21:44.070 --> 05:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
customer service metering that's so
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
we're not selling it for 22 cents
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
because the the energy piece is just a
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
small portion of it so i just wanted to
 
05:21:49.840 --> 05:21:50.948 align:start position:0%
small portion of it so i just wanted to
clarify

05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
05:21:53.830 --> 05:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you any questions
 
05:21:55.990 --> 05:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
for ms gamache
 
05:21:58.150 --> 05:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative thomas well thank you mr
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
can you give me a sense of what would be
 
05:22:03.360 --> 05:22:04.628 align:start position:0%
can you give me a sense of what would be
required

05:22:04.628 --> 05:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
labor-wise if you went to a monthly
 
05:22:07.600 --> 05:22:08.948 align:start position:0%
labor-wise if you went to a monthly
billing

05:22:08.948 --> 05:22:08.958 align:start position:0%
billing
 
05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
um so our billing folks have told us
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
that right now we do this particular
 
05:22:15.910 --> 05:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
type of credit
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
and and check writing manually
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
we would either have to
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
upgrade or institute a new billing
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
system to accommodate it or hire more
 
05:22:28.948 --> 05:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
employees to do it so they could even
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
tell me exactly what it would cost but
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:35.520 --> 05:22:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:22:37.830 --> 05:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:22:37.840 --> 05:22:39.110 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
i hate to ask the question this way
 
05:22:41.520 --> 05:22:42.830 align:start position:0%
i hate to ask the question this way
but

05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
why uh i mean i guess i'm not uh uh
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
the billing is
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i hear the billing is done
 
05:22:53.110 --> 05:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
once a year
 
05:22:54.390 --> 05:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:22:55.910 --> 05:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
doing it monthly
 
05:22:58.070 --> 05:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
what what causes you to have to hire
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
more people and you get to buy new
 
05:23:02.948 --> 05:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
software or just what's entailed just
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
show me why well the software that we
 
05:23:06.788 --> 05:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
use in our billing system right now does
 
05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
not allow us to cut a check monthly is
 
05:23:11.430 --> 05:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
the issue we have
 
05:23:13.750 --> 05:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
so that's why we have a manual we have
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year we have it done
 
05:23:17.430 --> 05:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
manually we it's the way it is in all of
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
our um in our service territory um if
 
05:23:22.470 --> 05:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
you wanted we wanted to change that we
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
would have to make changes to that
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
software or get new software or if we
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to do that it was cheaper
 
05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
because we'd have to prove to the puc we
 
05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
were trying to find the most
 
05:23:32.470 --> 05:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
cost-effective way to meet the
 
05:23:34.548 --> 05:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
requirement if it is cheaper to hire
 
05:23:36.390 --> 05:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
more employees to do it than we would
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
and you just heard from
 
05:23:41.430 --> 05:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
the gentleman before me now not uh
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
griffin but mr campbell that the intent
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
is for this to spread and have many many
 
05:23:48.548 --> 05:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
more um customers taking advantage of
 
05:23:50.230 --> 05:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
this so we would have many many more
 
05:23:52.310 --> 05:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
checks to cut and our system just
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it right now okay yeah great
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative pimentel has
 
05:24:00.628 --> 05:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:24:02.948 --> 05:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh ms gabash
 
05:24:05.520 --> 05:24:06.708 align:start position:0%
thank you uh ms gabash
so

05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
05:24:13.350 --> 05:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
i mean this could be simply done
 
05:24:15.190 --> 05:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
with a software
 
05:24:18.150 --> 05:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
upgrade which would be a one-time cost
 
05:24:20.788 --> 05:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
um our software upgrades um the upgrade
 
05:24:26.788 --> 05:24:26.798 align:start position:0%
itself is a one-time cost but we do have
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know maintenance issues that you
 
05:24:29.830 --> 05:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
know are associated with it but i'm not
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
gonna say the biggest cost is in the
 
05:24:33.030 --> 05:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
upgrade itself i'm so i would agree with
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
you there
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative berezni is
 
05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you ms
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
gamache for taking my question um if
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost the same or or will
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
it cost the same to upgrade to quarterly
 
05:24:49.590 --> 05:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
as it would be monthly if the upgrade is
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
the expensive part
 
05:24:55.110 --> 05:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't have that kind of detail in my
 
05:24:57.510 --> 05:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
response my assumption is it's probably
 
05:24:59.590 --> 05:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
close to the same but i don't know that
 
05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
05:25:03.510 --> 05:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.110 --> 05:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
05:25:05.120 --> 05:25:06.230 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
question

05:25:06.230 --> 05:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
my question is the same one i asked
 
05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
before do you know approximately
 
05:25:14.310 --> 05:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
what the average is how much money we're
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
talking about per month
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
is it enough to make the difference are
 
05:25:20.948 --> 05:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
we talking about fifteen hundred dollars
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
are we talking about five dollars what
 
05:25:25.910 --> 05:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
are we talking about for the average
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
customer not the big businesses i know
 
05:25:30.070 --> 05:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's going to
 
05:25:31.830 --> 05:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
but for the average customer do you have
 
05:25:34.390 --> 05:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
any idea if not is it possible to get
 
05:25:36.470 --> 05:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
that information let me go back and try
 
05:25:38.070 --> 05:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
to get it because i do not know but let
 
05:25:39.430 --> 05:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
me see what i can do about getting that
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:47.350 --> 05:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we'd
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
like to thank you ms gamache for
 
05:25:48.798 --> 05:25:50.230 align:start position:0%
like to thank you ms gamache for

didn't uh submit a pink card all right
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none then we'll close the public
 
05:26:04.548 --> 05:26:04.558 align:start position:0%

of the blue sheet we're going to get
 
05:26:12.948 --> 05:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
data from the blue sheet and then we're
 
05:26:15.190 --> 05:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
going to take a three minute recess
 
05:26:17.430 --> 05:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
before we start the hearing on senate
 
05:26:26.230 --> 05:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:31.270 --> 05:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
be back here at 2 30 for this in the
 
05:27:01.590 --> 05:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:18.958 --> 05:28:35.190 align:start position:0%
 
yep

05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
looks like a lot of people in here for
 
05:28:38.230 --> 05:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
the next bill
 
05:28:39.830 --> 05:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in here for the next
 
05:28:39.840 --> 05:28:57.670 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in here for the next
bill

05:28:57.670 --> 05:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.030 --> 05:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
this last bill will come out of
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee with an affirmative
 
05:29:01.440 --> 05:29:04.390 align:start position:0%
committee with an affirmative
adp

05:29:04.390 --> 05:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:15.190 --> 05:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:15.200 --> 05:29:22.390 align:start position:0%
 
unfortunately

05:29:22.390 --> 05:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
but yeah once a year is not reasonable
 
05:29:30.150 --> 05:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:31.350 --> 05:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
maybe if
 
05:29:33.910 --> 05:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
if once a year is reasonable i'll pay my
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:51.948 --> 05:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.708 --> 05:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.718 --> 05:30:36.548 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:30:36.548 --> 05:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:36.558 --> 05:30:47.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:30:47.190 --> 05:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:47.200 --> 05:31:12.548 align:start position:0%
 
yep

05:31:12.548 --> 05:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:12.558 --> 05:31:28.708 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:28.718 --> 05:31:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:52.000 --> 05:32:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:25.430 --> 05:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay let's open the public hearing on
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 2 6 2
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
relative to customer generators of
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
electrical energy and let me call to the
 
05:32:34.240 --> 05:32:36.150 align:start position:0%
electrical energy and let me call to the
microphone

05:32:36.150 --> 05:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
05:32:36.160 --> 05:32:37.110 align:start position:0%
microphone
senator

05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
senator
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
avart who is the prime sponsor of this
 
05:32:42.868 --> 05:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
bill welcome senator
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
and committee members and for the record
 
05:32:51.030 --> 05:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm senator kevin avard and i am the
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill and i have a
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
ton of professionals behind me who want
 
05:32:57.510 --> 05:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about it so i'm going to
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
introduce it to you and a couple of
 
05:33:00.788 --> 05:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
bullet points and then i'm going to
 
05:33:02.788 --> 05:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
reserve all the questions to them if you
 
05:33:04.150 --> 05:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't mind
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
just because they're a lot more savvy
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
than i am
 
05:33:09.430 --> 05:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
so this bill basically has four parts
 
05:33:11.430 --> 05:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
all which are designed to support
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
businesses in existing renewable energy
 
05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
programs in new hampshire
 
05:33:17.350 --> 05:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill addresses the net
 
05:33:19.750 --> 05:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
metering for large business customers
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
who have a load larger than one megawatt
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
but less than five megawatts and under
 
05:33:25.990 --> 05:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
current law companies who are who
 
05:33:27.910 --> 05:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
install on-site generation sometimes
 
05:33:30.070 --> 05:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
must put in systems which are smaller
 
05:33:31.510 --> 05:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
than their needs because they need to
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
limit the size of the project of one
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt to receive a net metering
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
credit so under this bill 80 of the
 
05:33:39.910 --> 05:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
power produced by the on-site generation
 
05:33:41.350 --> 05:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
must be consumed
 
05:33:41.360 --> 05:33:42.628 align:start position:0%
must be consumed
on-site

05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
on-site
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
the on-site consumption requirement in
 
05:33:46.230 --> 05:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is important protection
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
against potential cost shifting
 
05:33:51.910 --> 05:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill also is based
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
on hb 1481 from 2019
 
05:33:59.030 --> 05:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
which had bipartisan support but it did
 
05:34:01.830 --> 05:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
not make it through the entire process
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
an important change from hb 1481 is a
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
recognition of the puc in the process of
 
05:34:09.830 --> 05:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
studying to set the long-term rate of
 
05:34:12.310 --> 05:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
the net meter and credit and under sb
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
262 larger customers using the net
 
05:34:16.230 --> 05:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
metering approach
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
get credit
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
determined by the puc after it
 
05:34:22.548 --> 05:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
completed its study the second part of
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
this bill's definition of small and
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
large customer for net metering uh to
 
05:34:29.110 --> 05:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
state law these definitions currently
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
only exist in the puc rules
 
05:34:34.150 --> 05:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
and there is some inconsistencies in
 
05:34:35.590 --> 05:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
those rules between the different
 
05:34:37.670 --> 05:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
programs by setting the definition of
 
05:34:39.670 --> 05:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
small customers at a less than 500
 
05:34:39.680 --> 05:34:40.788 align:start position:0%
small customers at a less than 500
kilowatts

05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
kilowatts
 
05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
the bill sets the stage for more small
 
05:34:45.190 --> 05:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
businesses to participate in net
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
metering with the goal of giving them
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
more control over the energy cost
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
under the puc rules the small customer
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
level is capped at 100 kilowatts the
 
05:34:58.708 --> 05:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
bill raises that to 500 kilowatts
 
05:35:00.788 --> 05:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
the third section this bill also fixes
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
unintended glitches in the group net
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
metering law which does not allow
 
05:35:06.948 --> 05:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
existing self-generators to join the net
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
metering groups this fix will increase
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
the efficiency in the system as more
 
05:35:14.310 --> 05:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
cities and towns begin to use the new
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
municipal net metering law hb 315 which
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
we passed last year and the governor had
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
a nice ceremony for that out in the
 
05:35:26.708 --> 05:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
dairy area so for example if a town had
 
05:35:29.110 --> 05:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
installed a small solar system
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
a few years ago and now the town wants
 
05:35:33.750 --> 05:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
to form a group net metering program the
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
legacy system could not be included in
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
that new group of net metering program
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
this bill fixes that problem and will
 
05:35:44.470 --> 05:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
achieve the goals of hb 315.
 
05:35:45.990 --> 05:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
another component of the bill launches
 
05:35:47.430 --> 05:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
an investigation into making
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
improvements into the interconnection
 
05:35:51.350 --> 05:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
process which is used by the state self
 
05:35:53.910 --> 05:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
generators to interconnect with the
 
05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:59.350 --> 05:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
the process needs to be updated and the
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
cost and delay
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the current system there is a strong
 
05:36:05.110 --> 05:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
support for from all parties about the
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
need for this update
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the investigation sets the stage for
 
05:36:12.150 --> 05:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
changes at the puc
 
05:36:13.510 --> 05:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the senate the bill was amended to
 
05:36:15.510 --> 05:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
remove sections of law which have been
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
repealed in the past session in addition
 
05:36:19.990 --> 05:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
the senate changes the investigation
 
05:36:22.628 --> 05:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
into interconnections from the puc led
 
05:36:24.310 --> 05:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
effort to the one that will be
 
05:36:27.910 --> 05:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
undertaken by the department of energy
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
sb 262 had some opposition which was
 
05:36:31.910 --> 05:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
associated with the section of the bill
 
05:36:33.590 --> 05:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
which allows increase in net metering
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
cap to 5 megawatts for a single business
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
customer the opposition was about
 
05:36:41.190 --> 05:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
potential cost shift however the bill
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
has a few protections
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
on this front
 
05:36:46.948 --> 05:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
the bill requires that these customers
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
consume 80 percent of what they produce
 
05:36:51.910 --> 05:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
thus limiting how much
 
05:36:54.150 --> 05:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
would be net metered the puc will
 
05:36:56.310 --> 05:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
complete a study this spring to look at
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
05:36:59.190 --> 05:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
if any cost shifting related to net
 
05:36:59.200 --> 05:37:00.788 align:start position:0%
if any cost shifting related to net
metering

05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
metering
 
05:37:02.948 --> 05:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
that study will lead to the setting the
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
parameter a permanent rate for the net
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
meter and credit and this credit will
 
05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
apply to these customers
 
05:37:11.830 --> 05:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
there are only a small number of
 
05:37:11.840 --> 05:37:12.788 align:start position:0%
there are only a small number of
business

05:37:12.788 --> 05:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
customers in new hampshire who need a
 
05:37:16.868 --> 05:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
renewable project that is larger than
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
one megawatt so any risk of cost
 
05:37:18.718 --> 05:37:20.150 align:start position:0%
one megawatt so any risk of cost
shifting

05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
05:37:22.548 --> 05:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
is limited
 
05:37:24.628 --> 05:37:24.638 align:start position:0%
making this change in the law around at
 
05:37:27.030 --> 05:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
the same time at the puc finals
 
05:37:29.350 --> 05:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
the final puc study is expected will
 
05:37:31.830 --> 05:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
give businesses the lead time
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
they need for self-generation it can
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
take years to deal with the development
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
development issues
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
given that these businesses
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
start now will help planning up oh let
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
me read that all over again giving these
 
05:37:45.750 --> 05:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
businesses a start
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
now will help in the planning process
 
05:37:50.150 --> 05:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
and potentially provide the puc with
 
05:37:52.708 --> 05:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
additional data for future rulemaking
 
05:37:55.110 --> 05:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
for the large net metering
 
05:37:57.430 --> 05:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
in contrast to those opposed the
 
05:37:59.030 --> 05:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee received a letter of support
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
from several large manufacturing
 
05:38:02.948 --> 05:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
businesses who support this bill and see
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
it as a method of getting more tools to
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
address their high energy costs
 
05:38:14.150 --> 05:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for passing this bill
 
05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i would like to reserve the
 
05:38:17.350 --> 05:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
questions for some of the professionals
 
05:38:19.030 --> 05:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
who can actually talk about the guts of
 
05:38:20.788 --> 05:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you senator thank you for
 
05:38:24.548 --> 05:38:24.558 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill and we will asseed
 
05:38:27.270 --> 05:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
to your request that we let others ask
 
05:38:29.350 --> 05:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
questions or answer questions that we
 
05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
may have
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i will point out to the to those
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
assembled here that we have 11 people
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
who need to speak in the next 42 minutes
 
05:38:42.070 --> 05:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to be restricting
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh testimony to three minutes per person
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
starting with the next
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
person after the person who will speak
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
next we want to hear the
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
perspective of the department of energy
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
so i call griffin robarge to the stand
 
05:38:58.320 --> 05:39:02.548 align:start position:0%
so i call griffin robarge to the stand
please

05:39:02.548 --> 05:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:04.470 --> 05:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay i guess we'll get griffin's
 
05:39:07.030 --> 05:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
perspective later
 
05:39:09.190 --> 05:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
in that case i call
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:37.190 --> 05:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
to speak in front of the sdne committee
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
in support of sb 262. it's a pleasure to
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
be here and it's been a long time so i
 
05:39:46.390 --> 05:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
do see some familiar faces and it's
 
05:39:48.868 --> 05:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
great to see you and some new faces and
 
05:39:51.030 --> 05:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you also and thank you
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
very much for your service
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
i'm president and chief technical
 
05:39:57.830 --> 05:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
officer of standard power in nashua we
 
05:39:57.840 --> 05:39:58.948 align:start position:0%
officer of standard power in nashua we
represent

05:39:58.948 --> 05:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:40:01.030 --> 05:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
specifically today i think
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
keen but 45 other towns and 18 school
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
districts who some of these elements of
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
this bill are very significant too i do
 
05:40:10.470 --> 05:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
also represent a couple of customers
 
05:40:12.708 --> 05:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
that are as large as would be able to
 
05:40:14.708 --> 05:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
use part one
 
05:40:16.070 --> 05:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
which makes a lot of sense if it's
 
05:40:18.310 --> 05:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
eighty percent behind the meter that is
 
05:40:21.510 --> 05:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
a can is a very low impact element
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
um in the schools and towns i represent
 
05:40:27.270 --> 05:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
the increase in part two to 500 kw
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
is very significant because it allows
 
05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
many more of the typical size schools we
 
05:40:33.440 --> 05:40:34.390 align:start position:0%
many more of the typical size schools we
have

05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
to participate a behind the meter but in
 
05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
that metering
 
05:40:43.510 --> 05:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
to reduce their electrical bills
 
05:40:43.520 --> 05:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
to reduce their electrical bills
on

05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
part three
 
05:40:47.670 --> 05:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
this one here is
 
05:40:47.680 --> 05:40:48.548 align:start position:0%
this one here is
a

05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
very simple thing
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
if i put a system on my business 10
 
05:40:55.350 --> 05:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
years ago when solar was expensive but i
 
05:40:56.868 --> 05:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
did it as a statement
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
just to say i had solar
 
05:40:58.798 --> 05:41:00.310 align:start position:0%
just to say i had solar
that

05:41:00.310 --> 05:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:41:02.310 --> 05:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
piece of solar
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
would restrict me from participating as
 
05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
a member in any group net metering
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
program so for instance a customer who
 
05:41:11.750 --> 05:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
has two meters this is a real example
 
05:41:13.830 --> 05:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
that use four million kilowatt hours
 
05:41:13.840 --> 05:41:15.030 align:start position:0%
that use four million kilowatt hours
each

05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
each
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
and has a 25 kw system on each meter
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
that makes only 35 000 kilowatt hours a
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
year is restricted from participating in
 
05:41:27.190 --> 05:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
a group net metering program
 
05:41:28.628 --> 05:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
they would benefit greatly from that
 
05:41:30.628 --> 05:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
group net metering program which would
 
05:41:30.638 --> 05:41:31.430 align:start position:0%
group net metering program which would
help

05:41:31.430 --> 05:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
develop other projects around the state
 
05:41:37.510 --> 05:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:40.868 --> 05:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:43.510 --> 05:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
is also extremely important whenever we
 
05:41:45.590 --> 05:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
look at a new project the the big
 
05:41:47.350 --> 05:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
question mark on cost is the
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
interconnection costs and having some
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
process an idea of what those costs
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
might be so that an engineer like myself
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
could do a a quick assessment and have a
 
05:41:59.110 --> 05:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
range of ideas as to what that would
 
05:41:59.120 --> 05:42:02.070 align:start position:0%
range of ideas as to what that would
cost

05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions i'd
 
05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
like to point out one last thing
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
standard power administers group net
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
metering programs for over 30 small
 
05:42:12.150 --> 05:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
hydros here in new hampshire
 
05:42:15.990 --> 05:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
and a handful of solar projects so we do
 
05:42:18.470 --> 05:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
have a vast experience with this and
 
05:42:23.670 --> 05:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr hayden nice job two out two
 
05:42:28.310 --> 05:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
minutes and 34 seconds well sir the
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
three-minute limit i've learned from
 
05:42:32.628 --> 05:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
your leadership
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay questions for mr hayden
 
05:42:37.670 --> 05:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
05:42:39.190 --> 05:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:42:41.190 --> 05:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah and you covered everything
 
05:42:42.628 --> 05:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
that's pretty impressive
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
um it sounds to me like the bill is uh
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
sort of a cleanup bill that's put
 
05:42:49.910 --> 05:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
together to try and address some of the
 
05:42:51.590 --> 05:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
issues that have arisen over time as
 
05:42:52.948 --> 05:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
people have been adopting you talked
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
about the early adopters being left out
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
yes that sort of thing can you say a
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
little more about
 
05:42:57.680 --> 05:42:58.708 align:start position:0%
little more about
that

05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned low impact on the 80
 
05:43:02.708 --> 05:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
behind the meter
 
05:43:05.590 --> 05:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
can you just give a little more on so
 
05:43:05.600 --> 05:43:07.190 align:start position:0%
can you just give a little more on so
um

05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
last first
 
05:43:08.878 --> 05:43:10.070 align:start position:0%
last first
when

05:43:10.070 --> 05:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:43:12.150 --> 05:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
energy produced by a distributed energy
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
resource is produced behind the meter
 
05:43:18.470 --> 05:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
it has only an impact on the amount of
 
05:43:21.190 --> 05:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
electricity supplied to the location
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
not only that but it has an impact on
 
05:43:26.230 --> 05:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
the distribution and transmission
 
05:43:29.350 --> 05:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
service it minimizes or reduces the
 
05:43:31.510 --> 05:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
pressure on those things now i'm not
 
05:43:33.830 --> 05:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
saying it reduces the cost because the
 
05:43:35.670 --> 05:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
cost tends to be a fixed cost of
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
building those things
 
05:43:39.510 --> 05:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution but
 
05:43:42.070 --> 05:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
reducing the pressure on it may include
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
the reduction of maintenance so it's a
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
very positive thing from the tnd side
 
05:43:50.070 --> 05:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
but it's also important to the business
 
05:43:52.470 --> 05:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
because it may allow them to avoid those
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
22 cent kilowatt hours we talked about
 
05:43:57.510 --> 05:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
earlier in the last bill and i think for
 
05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
a business it's probably more like 17
 
05:44:01.990 --> 05:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
but it is pretty significant
 
05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
what was the other part
 
05:44:05.350 --> 05:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh the other part of the cleanup that i
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned was let's see
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
how the early adopters are unable to
 
05:44:13.350 --> 05:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
join in group net metering and you were
 
05:44:13.360 --> 05:44:14.230 align:start position:0%
join in group net metering and you were
saying

05:44:14.230 --> 05:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that's an oversight or a
 
05:44:18.390 --> 05:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
mistake that we want to it really feels
 
05:44:21.430 --> 05:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
like it as probably the entity that does
 
05:44:23.990 --> 05:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
the most group net metering programs in
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it does seem like an
 
05:44:27.190 --> 05:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
oversight for
 
05:44:30.070 --> 05:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
particularly large entities even even
 
05:44:31.830 --> 05:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
the city of keene
 
05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
who i also represent as a consultant
 
05:44:33.920 --> 05:44:35.110 align:start position:0%
who i also represent as a consultant
here

05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
and stonyfield which is another company
 
05:44:40.230 --> 05:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
i work with extensively they have legacy
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
systems a very small amount of solar
 
05:44:45.990 --> 05:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
that prevents them for participating in
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
as a member in a group net metering
 
05:44:49.750 --> 05:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
program and to your point about this
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
being a cleanup bill i agree it does
 
05:44:54.628 --> 05:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
appear to be somewhat similar to sb 91
 
05:44:56.548 --> 05:44:56.558 align:start position:0%
from last year which was
 
05:44:58.150 --> 05:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
just to fix a few little problems
 
05:45:00.390 --> 05:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
associated with some of our distributed
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr hayden
 
05:45:08.230 --> 05:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
see no further questions
 
05:45:12.310 --> 05:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
i will uh call on our next uh
 
05:45:14.230 --> 05:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr votes it's a testifier with
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome
 
05:45:17.670 --> 05:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
and now i'd like to get the does
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vos and members of
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
the committee again for the record
 
05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
griffin roberge from the new hampshire
 
05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
05:45:38.548 --> 05:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
we are neutral on senate bill 262 uh but
 
05:45:41.190 --> 05:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as you've seen does make
 
05:45:43.590 --> 05:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
various changes to new hampshire's
 
05:45:46.150 --> 05:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
net metering statute so to try to be a
 
05:45:47.510 --> 05:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
little simple about i'll try to go
 
05:45:51.150 --> 05:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:51.160 --> 05:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:45:55.510 --> 05:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.628 --> 05:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
so in section 1
 
05:46:02.868 --> 05:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
which is lines 1 to 18
 
05:46:04.788 --> 05:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
the bill extends new hampshire's net
 
05:46:07.350 --> 05:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
mirroring facility size limit above one
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
megawatt for those customer generators
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
who have a facility with a total peak
 
05:46:14.310 --> 05:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
generating capacity there's not more
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
than 125 percent of a customer's average
 
05:46:18.470 --> 05:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
electric consumption
 
05:46:20.788 --> 05:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
over the past 12 months
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
this language allows a facility over a
 
05:46:24.788 --> 05:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
megawatt there's non-municipal host to
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
net meter if it has more or less
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
at least 80 percent load consumption
 
05:46:33.270 --> 05:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
behind the meter
 
05:46:34.868 --> 05:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
new the department want to at least
 
05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
raise a technical concern with this
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
language as there's nothing really
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the section about what
 
05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
happens to that system if a customer's
 
05:46:45.270 --> 05:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
average electric consumption drops over
 
05:46:46.948 --> 05:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
that 12-month period
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
one of these uh one of these businesses
 
05:46:50.548 --> 05:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
that may
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
become a customer generator might
 
05:46:53.910 --> 05:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
implement some energy efficiency
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
measures which reduces their average
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
electric consumption over a given time
 
05:47:00.390 --> 05:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
period also there could be a pandemic
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
that occurs that reduces electric
 
05:47:05.430 --> 05:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
consumption over a 12 month period so
 
05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a clarity there as to
 
05:47:09.910 --> 05:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
what might happen if say electric
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
consumption drops as to what happens
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
with that system because it's just not
 
05:47:13.360 --> 05:47:15.590 align:start position:0%
with that system because it's just not
clear

05:47:15.590 --> 05:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:47:15.600 --> 05:47:17.190 align:start position:0%
clear

to 500

kilowatts up to five megawatts this
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
would be a change from the current

system construct um under the

wanted to note that there is i believe a
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
typo on line 14
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
it says the term small generator shall
 
05:48:02.470 --> 05:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
apply to a customer generator i'm not
 
05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
sure if that should be small customer
 
05:48:04.400 --> 05:48:05.750 align:start position:0%
sure if that should be small customer
generator

05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
generator
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
on that line just to make it consistent
 
05:48:10.868 --> 05:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
um additionally you know we have the
 
05:48:13.590 --> 05:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
definition of customer generator here
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
on line three in this section then we're
 
05:48:18.230 --> 05:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
inserting two additional definitions to
 
05:48:19.910 --> 05:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
two different terms
 
05:48:21.830 --> 05:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the existence of another definition
 
05:48:24.788 --> 05:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
so basically three definitions
 
05:48:27.190 --> 05:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
in one turn in one phrase eligible
 
05:48:29.110 --> 05:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
customer generator so unsure if that
 
05:48:31.990 --> 05:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
should be broken out so um that is at
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
least the points i wanted to raise on
 
05:48:37.510 --> 05:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
section one section two
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
goes back to what i had mentioned on the
 
05:48:41.430 --> 05:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
previous bill senate bill 261 and there
 
05:48:43.830 --> 05:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
being legacy statute existing in new
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire's net metering statute that's
 
05:48:48.070 --> 05:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
largely been superseded by
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
puc order and proceedings the language
 
05:48:54.390 --> 05:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
being removed on page 1 line 24
 
05:48:57.910 --> 05:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
to the rest of page 2
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
has largely been superseded by those
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
orders this language removes
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
some caps that were imposed on total
 
05:49:06.548 --> 05:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
customer generating capacity and utility
 
05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
service areas that's really no longer in
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
effect so
 
05:49:12.150 --> 05:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
the department kind of views that as
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
really clean up
 
05:49:16.628 --> 05:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
section three
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
just on line 19
 
05:49:21.430 --> 05:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
05:49:24.868 --> 05:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
strikes service and puts in serving
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't believe that
 
05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
makes any significant change it seems
 
05:49:31.030 --> 05:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
like a technical correction in nature
 
05:49:33.110 --> 05:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
so again more of a grammatical
 
05:49:33.120 --> 05:49:34.948 align:start position:0%
so again more of a grammatical
clarification

05:49:34.948 --> 05:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
section 4
 
05:49:40.390 --> 05:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
which begins on page 2. line 23
 
05:49:43.510 --> 05:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
deletes the 100 kilowatt threshold
 
05:49:45.670 --> 05:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
between small and large customer
 
05:49:47.430 --> 05:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
generators and makes that threshold now
 
05:49:49.590 --> 05:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
500 kilowatts
 
05:49:52.230 --> 05:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's unclear what the potential
 
05:49:54.150 --> 05:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
rate payer or financial impact of that
 
05:49:56.310 --> 05:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
change may be as has been previously
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is a vdr study that's
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
being directed by the puc
 
05:50:03.270 --> 05:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
that stays expected to be completed by
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
late spring of this year
 
05:50:07.110 --> 05:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
and will help afford the inform the
 
05:50:08.948 --> 05:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
future development of net metering
 
05:50:11.590 --> 05:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
tariffs in the state
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
also you know increasing the small to
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
large threshold may exacerbate any
 
05:50:18.948 --> 05:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
impacts of cost shifting to the extent
 
05:50:21.030 --> 05:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
that they are occurring um and
 
05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
additionally there was a bill in 2020
 
05:50:26.230 --> 05:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's house bill 466 that sought to
 
05:50:28.470 --> 05:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
increase this 100 kilowatt threshold up
 
05:50:28.480 --> 05:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
increase this 100 kilowatt threshold up
to

05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatts and that was vetoed so i just
 
05:50:32.948 --> 05:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
share that for the committee's
 
05:50:32.958 --> 05:50:35.510 align:start position:0%
share that for the committee's
consideration

05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
section 5 which begins on page 2 lines
 
05:50:39.040 --> 05:50:41.110 align:start position:0%
section 5 which begins on page 2 lines
35

05:50:41.110 --> 05:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
35
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
and goes to page 3 line seven
 
05:50:47.430 --> 05:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
that provides that customer generators
 
05:50:49.830 --> 05:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
larger than a hundred kilowatts
 
05:50:52.070 --> 05:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
up to one megawatt with an in-service
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
date after january one of 2022 must
 
05:50:57.910 --> 05:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
consume at least 20 percent generation
 
05:50:59.430 --> 05:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
on site
 
05:51:01.350 --> 05:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
the department views this as a as a
 
05:51:03.110 --> 05:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
change in the current as a change in the
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
current alternative net metering tariff
 
05:51:07.510 --> 05:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
which imposes a 20 behind the meter
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
consumption requirement on all net meter
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
facilities above 100 kilowatts to
 
05:51:16.390 --> 05:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry above 100 kilowatts that do
 
05:51:19.030 --> 05:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
not group net meter so in effect the
 
05:51:20.150 --> 05:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
department views this as a
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
reclassification of the behind the meter
 
05:51:23.750 --> 05:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
consumption requirements for different
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
systems into three different categories
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
it's implied at least in the language
 
05:51:30.788 --> 05:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
that as we read it implies that there's
 
05:51:33.030 --> 05:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
no load requirement for systems less
 
05:51:35.350 --> 05:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
than a hundred kilowatts or between a
 
05:51:35.360 --> 05:51:36.390 align:start position:0%
than a hundred kilowatts or between a
hundred

05:51:36.390 --> 05:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
and a hundred kilowatts in one megawatt
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
that began operation before 2022 that's
 
05:51:41.680 --> 05:51:42.708 align:start position:0%
that began operation before 2022 that's
one

05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
the second one there's a 20 load
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
requirement for systems greater than 100
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
kilowatts up to one megawatt with an
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
operation date um
 
05:51:56.788 --> 05:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh before 2022 after sorry um and number
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
three there's an 80 load requirement for
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
systems greater than one megawatt as
 
05:52:02.868 --> 05:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
outlined in section one i'm almost near
 
05:52:03.990 --> 05:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
the end
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
section six
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
permits customer generators to serve as
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
a group host
 
05:52:11.910 --> 05:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
for any group of customers within the
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
same utility service territory the
 
05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
statute currently allows group hosts to
 
05:52:18.470 --> 05:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
serve any such customers as group
 
05:52:20.628 --> 05:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
members so long as they are not customer
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
generators themselves a department's
 
05:52:25.270 --> 05:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
belief is that the intention of that
 
05:52:26.948 --> 05:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
statute was to direct net metering
 
05:52:29.430 --> 05:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
benefits to customers who couldn't take
 
05:52:31.990 --> 05:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of net metering themselves
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
the bill would broadly expand the
 
05:52:35.670 --> 05:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
numbers and types of customers who can
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
participate in group net metering
 
05:52:37.200 --> 05:52:38.788 align:start position:0%
participate in group net metering
arrangements

05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
arrangements
 
05:52:40.390 --> 05:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
based on the hearing in the senate if
 
05:52:42.868 --> 05:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
the primary concern were to include more
 
05:52:42.878 --> 05:52:44.230 align:start position:0%
the primary concern were to include more
municipal

05:52:44.230 --> 05:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
05:52:46.868 --> 05:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
customer accounts in the municipal host
 
05:52:49.110 --> 05:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
definition then it is possible to limit
 
05:52:50.788 --> 05:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
the exception to only political
 
05:52:53.270 --> 05:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that way narrowly narrow
 
05:52:53.280 --> 05:52:54.948 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that way narrowly narrow
narrowly

05:52:54.948 --> 05:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
narrowly
 
05:52:54.958 --> 05:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
narrowly
narrow

05:52:55.910 --> 05:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
05:52:57.830 --> 05:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
tailoring um
 
05:53:00.310 --> 05:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
the exception to political subdivisions
 
05:53:02.390 --> 05:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
section 8
 
05:53:05.510 --> 05:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
which begins on
 
05:53:08.230 --> 05:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
page 3 line 29
 
05:53:09.670 --> 05:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
that requires new hampshire's electric
 
05:53:11.670 --> 05:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities to publish
 
05:53:14.390 --> 05:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
hosting capacity maps on their website
 
05:53:16.470 --> 05:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh these maps would show where
 
05:53:18.070 --> 05:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
distributed generation can be
 
05:53:19.830 --> 05:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
accommodated on the distribution system
 
05:53:22.070 --> 05:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
without adverse impacts and without
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
requiring significant infrastructure
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
upgrades department acknowledges that
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
this concept has been discussed in pucs
 
05:53:30.628 --> 05:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
grid and modernization dockets and it
 
05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
has been successfully implemented in
 
05:53:34.548 --> 05:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
other in other states
 
05:53:36.788 --> 05:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
and then section 9 requires the
 
05:53:39.670 --> 05:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
department to conduct a proceeding
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
to invest the potential modification of
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to ensure
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
cost-effective predictable and timely
 
05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
interconnection procedures the
 
05:53:49.030 --> 05:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
department did provide feedback on an
 
05:53:51.110 --> 05:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and the senate to address
 
05:53:53.430 --> 05:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
technical concerns with this section and
 
05:53:54.788 --> 05:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
would enable the department to
 
05:53:56.868 --> 05:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
adequately complete the study that's
 
05:53:58.788 --> 05:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
outlined in the bill
 
05:54:00.628 --> 05:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
i apologize for losing some of you if i
 
05:54:02.788 --> 05:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
did and uh that concludes my testimony
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:54:07.430 --> 05:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr robarge excellent testimony
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative platt has a question
 
05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you good to get my
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
05:54:14.070 --> 05:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
mr robarge and i have to admit it's
 
05:54:15.670 --> 05:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
clerk you did lose me part way through
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
there i couldn't keep up with you yes uh
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:54:21.510 --> 05:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of some several other bills
 
05:54:23.430 --> 05:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
concerning net metering in one way or
 
05:54:26.070 --> 05:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
another tends to expand net metering
 
05:54:28.948 --> 05:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh and would the is it premature
 
05:54:30.788 --> 05:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the uh
 
05:54:32.310 --> 05:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh cost of
 
05:54:34.390 --> 05:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
the value of distributed energy v that
 
05:54:36.470 --> 05:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it's called uh a study coming
 
05:54:36.480 --> 05:54:37.430 align:start position:0%
whatever it's called uh a study coming
out

05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:54:39.750 --> 05:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
put the uh take away the
 
05:54:41.430 --> 05:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
impetus for a lot of this if it turns
 
05:54:44.070 --> 05:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
out it eliminates cost shifting and
 
05:54:45.510 --> 05:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
there might not be value in doing
 
05:54:47.350 --> 05:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
something like this well that's a thank
 
05:54:48.868 --> 05:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh representative
 
05:54:51.190 --> 05:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
that is a decision for policymakers such
 
05:54:53.430 --> 05:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
as yourselves to make the department has
 
05:54:55.430 --> 05:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
one it obviously has acknowledged
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
throughout many bills have come up that
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
there is an ongoing value of distributed
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
energy resources study that will help
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
arrive at an appropriate value for these
 
05:55:04.000 --> 05:55:05.830 align:start position:0%
arrive at an appropriate value for these
resources

05:55:05.830 --> 05:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
and look at various issues whether or
 
05:55:07.920 --> 05:55:09.510 align:start position:0%
and look at various issues whether or
not

05:55:09.510 --> 05:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:55:12.150 --> 05:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
makers wanted to expand net metering
 
05:55:14.708 --> 05:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
before the conclusion of that study
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
is obviously a decision for folks like
 
05:55:19.030 --> 05:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
you to make the department just wants to
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
obviously emphasize that that study is
 
05:55:20.958 --> 05:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
obviously emphasize that that study is
ongoing

05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
you representative harrington has a few
 
05:55:26.160 --> 05:55:27.750 align:start position:0%
you representative harrington has a few
questions

05:55:27.750 --> 05:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:55:28.948 --> 05:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
05:55:33.430 --> 05:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
i did have a couple of questions uh on
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
the line six and seven when it talks
 
05:55:36.000 --> 05:55:37.590 align:start position:0%
the line six and seven when it talks
about

05:55:37.590 --> 05:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
total generating capacity up to
 
05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
including one megawatt or 125 percent of
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
the customer's average electric
 
05:55:46.868 --> 05:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
consumption over the past five months if
 
05:55:48.548 --> 05:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
greater which i assume if their
 
05:55:50.788 --> 05:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
generation potential is greater than one
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
but less than five megawatts so there is
 
05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
no cap on that so that could be 125
 
05:55:57.430 --> 05:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
percent of
 
05:56:00.390 --> 05:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
eight megawatt hours or 20 megawatt
 
05:56:05.190 --> 05:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:06.788 --> 05:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't know why my mic went off
 
05:56:09.030 --> 05:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry uh thank you for the
 
05:56:10.470 --> 05:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
question the language on eight does
 
05:56:12.470 --> 05:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
specify that the system has to be large
 
05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
less than five megawatts but the
 
05:56:14.160 --> 05:56:15.990 align:start position:0%
less than five megawatts but the
department

05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:56:17.590 --> 05:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
looked at the language and
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
assumed that there was a rough formula
 
05:56:22.150 --> 05:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
to ascertain the size of a system um
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's the average electric consumption
 
05:56:26.548 --> 05:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
over 12 months divided by 1.25 would
 
05:56:29.110 --> 05:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
equal your system size so it would have
 
05:56:31.110 --> 05:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
to be less than obviously five megawatts
 
05:56:34.150 --> 05:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
to be in line with what's being proposed
 
05:56:36.150 --> 05:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
my point is i'm trying to get at is you
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
could go let's just say your facility
 
05:56:41.270 --> 05:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
again it has 4.9 megawatts uh solar
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
production yes it could consume
 
05:56:47.670 --> 05:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
10 megawatt hours a year 20 megawatt
 
05:56:51.750 --> 05:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
hours a year and so it could up to 125
 
05:56:53.590 --> 05:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
for that consumption could still be
 
05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
considered a customer generator that's
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
impossible there's no limit on that
 
05:56:58.470 --> 05:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's possible
 
05:56:59.990 --> 05:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
second question
 
05:57:01.510 --> 05:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
a number of people have mentioned this
 
05:57:03.030 --> 05:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker and you had
 
05:57:06.150 --> 05:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned it on internal consumption of
 
05:57:07.590 --> 05:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
the electricity
 
05:57:07.600 --> 05:57:08.628 align:start position:0%
the electricity
and

05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:10.548 --> 05:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
everyone kept putting out 80 percent
 
05:57:12.788 --> 05:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
whereas i can't find it yeah no and and
 
05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that the department
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
highlighted it i probably should have
 
05:57:17.750 --> 05:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted but it's not explicitly
 
05:57:20.310 --> 05:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the bill that's why we i
 
05:57:22.230 --> 05:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
guess in talking with
 
05:57:24.548 --> 05:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
other staffers at doe is that we assume
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
that there's an 80 load requirement if
 
05:57:27.670 --> 05:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
you're taking the average electric
 
05:57:29.910 --> 05:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
consumption over the past 12 months
 
05:57:32.548 --> 05:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
dividing that or dividing that by
 
05:57:35.910 --> 05:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
125 or 1.25 and that's where you get you
 
05:57:37.990 --> 05:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
know at that figure but again it's not
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly spelled out it's not in the
 
05:57:42.070 --> 05:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
game one more quick one one more
 
05:57:44.070 --> 05:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
the uh there's a lot of places in here
 
05:57:46.230 --> 05:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
where it talks about five going from 100
 
05:57:48.390 --> 05:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
kilowatts to 500 kilowatts changing the
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
classifications shows up a number of
 
05:57:51.868 --> 05:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
places in the build what are the
 
05:57:55.030 --> 05:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
ramifications of making that change from
 
05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
a small customer generator whose
 
05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
facility has a total maximum capacity of
 
05:58:02.548 --> 05:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
not more than 100 to not more than 500.
 
05:58:04.470 --> 05:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
so in essence the way the department
 
05:58:06.390 --> 05:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
reads it is that if you are expanding
 
05:58:09.750 --> 05:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
the one the current 100 kilowatt i'm
 
05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
sorry kilowatt threshold that's
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
currently in statute that
 
05:58:15.430 --> 05:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned in the last last bill the
 
05:58:17.590 --> 05:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
puc does have the ability to modify that
 
05:58:20.230 --> 05:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
size limit but hasn't exercised that yet
 
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
um if they do increase it to 500
 
05:58:23.990 --> 05:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
megawatts you in essence be taking the
 
05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
alternative net metering tariff that's
 
05:58:26.868 --> 05:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
in place today
 
05:58:28.868 --> 05:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
the tariff that's in existence for those
 
05:58:30.470 --> 05:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
less than 100 kilowatts you would be
 
05:58:33.110 --> 05:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
expanding that tariff for systems up to
 
05:58:35.510 --> 05:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
500 kilos so they would be did we be
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
paying the higher rate to more people or
 
05:58:40.628 --> 05:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
to bigger systems you would be paying
 
05:58:42.390 --> 05:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
yes the alternative net metering tariff
 
05:58:47.670 --> 05:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
customer charge demand charge full
 
05:58:51.430 --> 05:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
credit on default service 25
 
05:58:53.110 --> 05:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
distribution and full credit on
 
05:58:55.830 --> 05:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
transmission no credit on non-bypassable
 
05:58:58.548 --> 05:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
charges okay so there would be
 
05:58:58.558 --> 05:58:59.510 align:start position:0%
charges okay so there would be
a

05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:59:01.270 --> 05:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in what was being
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
paid to those between 100 and 500
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:08.948 --> 05:59:08.958 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for mr robarge
 
05:59:11.190 --> 05:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
mr lewicky representative the wiki uh
 
05:59:12.628 --> 05:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
05:59:15.590 --> 05:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
roberge um one thing i start wondering
 
05:59:18.070 --> 05:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
about is we talk about the electricity
 
05:59:19.750 --> 05:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
consumption the only electricity
 
05:59:21.270 --> 05:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
consumption that we can measure is at
 
05:59:23.830 --> 05:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
the meter and we don't have how could we
 
05:59:25.590 --> 05:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
possibly know how much energy is being
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
consumed behind the meter when they're
 
05:59:29.990 --> 05:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
making their own and they're buying some
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
from the electric company and selling
 
05:59:33.750 --> 05:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
some to the electric company well i
 
05:59:35.110 --> 05:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
believe that the
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh puc order that was issued in uh june
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
of 2017 required by directional mirrors
 
05:59:42.788 --> 05:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
to kind of measure the input and output
 
05:59:44.070 --> 05:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
that goes on to the grid that comes in
 
05:59:45.750 --> 05:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
from the grid and that type of thing so
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
i imagine those types of meters you know
 
05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
measure that accurately
 
05:59:50.480 --> 05:59:51.990 align:start position:0%
measure that accurately
follow-up

05:59:51.990 --> 05:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:59:53.910 --> 05:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
if that was the question you were asking
 
05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
no that's really not the question
 
05:59:56.628 --> 05:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
because we can only measure at the
 
05:59:59.110 --> 05:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
interface to the grid yes and so we do
 
06:00:00.548 --> 06:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
not know how much that customer is
 
06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
consuming internally if they're
 
06:00:03.990 --> 06:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
generating their own energy internally
 
06:00:06.070 --> 06:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
and using some proportion of it if they
 
06:00:07.350 --> 06:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether they're using ten
 
06:00:09.910 --> 06:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
percent uh of supplying ten percent of
 
06:00:12.548 --> 06:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
their own energy or uh
 
06:00:15.830 --> 06:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
100 of it yes so i again now i
 
06:00:16.948 --> 06:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
understand your question thank you
 
06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative um yeah again
 
06:00:20.160 --> 06:00:21.590 align:start position:0%
representative um yeah again
there

06:00:21.590 --> 06:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot more load
 
06:00:24.868 --> 06:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
requirements in this bill because we are
 
06:00:27.430 --> 06:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
the bill proposes to segregate out
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
different systems with various load
 
06:00:29.200 --> 06:00:30.830 align:start position:0%
different systems with various load
requirements

06:00:30.830 --> 06:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:00:33.110 --> 06:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah there
 
06:00:34.708 --> 06:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
may be a bit of difficulty but i
 
06:00:36.470 --> 06:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer that definitively right
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
here and now i'd like to talk to more
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:42.868 --> 06:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
06:00:44.830 --> 06:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
pitts is recognized
 
06:00:48.390 --> 06:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
quickly we keep mentioning cost shifting
 
06:00:49.670 --> 06:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
any uh projection as to what this bill
 
06:00:56.150 --> 06:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
if it would indeed add to cause cost
 
06:00:56.160 --> 06:00:57.430 align:start position:0%
if it would indeed add to cause cost
shifting

06:00:57.430 --> 06:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
06:00:57.440 --> 06:00:58.868 align:start position:0%
shifting
and

06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:00.390 --> 06:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
would it be wise i'm going to just
 
06:01:01.750 --> 06:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
follow up with the second question you
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
can answer them both
 
06:01:05.190 --> 06:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
would it be wise to wait for the study
 
06:01:07.270 --> 06:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
to come out before taking action on this
 
06:01:09.830 --> 06:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill thank you representative um i think
 
06:01:11.830 --> 06:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's what the department is at
 
06:01:11.840 --> 06:01:12.948 align:start position:0%
i think that's what the department is at
least

06:01:12.948 --> 06:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
least
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
at least explain to policy makers that
 
06:01:18.070 --> 06:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
there is this study coming out you know
 
06:01:20.310 --> 06:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
that study might will help inform the
 
06:01:21.830 --> 06:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
extent of cost shifting if it is
 
06:01:21.840 --> 06:01:22.868 align:start position:0%
extent of cost shifting if it is
occurring

06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
06:01:24.470 --> 06:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
expanding that mirroring before the
 
06:01:26.310 --> 06:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
release of that study would likely
 
06:01:28.788 --> 06:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
exacerbate cost shifting if it is
 
06:01:28.798 --> 06:01:30.150 align:start position:0%
exacerbate cost shifting if it is
occurring

06:01:30.150 --> 06:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
06:01:33.190 --> 06:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
if it is occurring yes
 
06:01:35.590 --> 06:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay mr robarge we thank you very much
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on because we have
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
11 more people who want to testify in
 
06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
the next 30 minutes i will next call on
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
doria brown from nashua miss brown nice
 
06:01:51.670 --> 06:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:54.150 --> 06:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry sorry i apologize but i
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.190 --> 06:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
hello i'm doria brown i'm the energy
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
manager for the city of nashua and i'm
 
06:02:04.868 --> 06:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
going to take you guys a little bit away
 
06:02:07.110 --> 06:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
from the numbers and tell you a story
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
about the city of nashua's energy
 
06:02:11.510 --> 06:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
journey so we purchased two
 
06:02:14.150 --> 06:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric dams and you all are
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
actually a part of this journey as well
 
06:02:17.270 --> 06:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
because last year you allowed us to be
 
06:02:19.750 --> 06:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
able to net meter our larger dam which
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
is mine falls which can generate about
 
06:02:25.270 --> 06:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
15 million kilowatt hours every single
 
06:02:25.280 --> 06:02:26.150 align:start position:0%
15 million kilowatt hours every single
year

06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
so now she was a little bit unique
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
because we are the only community that
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
owns our own hydroelectric and has
 
06:02:34.470 --> 06:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
generation of
 
06:02:34.480 --> 06:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
generation of
this

06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:02:36.868 --> 06:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
monumental like
 
06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
amount and
 
06:02:41.750 --> 06:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
as we leave our contract that we are
 
06:02:43.750 --> 06:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
currently in at mine falls we actually
 
06:02:45.590 --> 06:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to create a net metering group to
 
06:02:49.670 --> 06:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
be able to put energy into the grid
 
06:02:51.910 --> 06:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
we'd love to be able to use our city
 
06:02:54.948 --> 06:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
buildings and our school portfolio
 
06:02:58.470 --> 06:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
is that matching mine falls but a lot of
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
our school buildings have solar on them
 
06:03:03.590 --> 06:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
so we would not be able to use them to
 
06:03:05.190 --> 06:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
create a net metering group because
 
06:03:07.350 --> 06:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
they're generators so this bill would
 
06:03:09.030 --> 06:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
allow us to
 
06:03:10.948 --> 06:03:10.958 align:start position:0%
be able to create that net metering
 
06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
group and put energy into
 
06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
the grid and take advantage of the net
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
metering rules that were changed last
 
06:03:20.868 --> 06:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
year so that's the end of my testimony
 
06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you that's a nice story
 
06:03:29.190 --> 06:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee um
 
06:03:34.390 --> 06:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
miss brown can you thank you mr chairman
 
06:03:36.470 --> 06:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh miss brown can you comment on whether
 
06:03:36.480 --> 06:03:37.430 align:start position:0%
uh miss brown can you comment on whether
the

06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
06:03:41.830 --> 06:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
small generator cap from 100 kilowatts
 
06:03:43.830 --> 06:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
to 500 kilowatts would have any effect
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
on your plant and your efforts to group
 
06:03:49.350 --> 06:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
net meter
 
06:03:51.590 --> 06:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that would have any
 
06:03:51.600 --> 06:03:52.788 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that would have any
effect

06:03:52.788 --> 06:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
effect
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
on us
 
06:03:56.390 --> 06:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
because we
 
06:03:59.110 --> 06:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
already are able to net meter over that
 
06:04:01.590 --> 06:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
megawatt as a community
 
06:04:03.430 --> 06:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:04:05.430 --> 06:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't think changing that cap would
 
06:04:05.440 --> 06:04:06.230 align:start position:0%
i i don't think changing that cap would
help

06:04:06.230 --> 06:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
help
 
06:04:07.830 --> 06:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
the city of nashua but it would
 
06:04:09.270 --> 06:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
definitely help
 
06:04:11.910 --> 06:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
commute our community who are not in the
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
city portfolio
 
06:04:14.830 --> 06:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
06:04:17.670 --> 06:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
you okay so you know further questions
 
06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
we appreciate you being here ms brown
 
06:04:24.470 --> 06:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:26.628 --> 06:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
mari bruner from
 
06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:39.190 --> 06:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:39.200 --> 06:04:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:04:40.470 --> 06:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:04:42.070 --> 06:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's red when it's on it's opposite in
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
the city of keene sorry about that my
 
06:04:45.670 --> 06:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
name is mary brenner i'm the senior
 
06:04:48.070 --> 06:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
planner for the city of keene and i'm
 
06:04:49.750 --> 06:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in support of sb
 
06:04:49.760 --> 06:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in support of sb
262.

06:04:52.310 --> 06:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
262.
 
06:04:53.670 --> 06:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's a few different things in this
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
bill that would help the city but i'm
 
06:04:56.470 --> 06:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
going to speak specifically to the
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
provision that would allow a customer
 
06:05:00.708 --> 06:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
generator to still participate in group
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
06:05:05.510 --> 06:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
i believe that senator avard mentioned
 
06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
he mentioned you know if there's a small
 
06:05:10.070 --> 06:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
legacy system that could impact someone
 
06:05:11.830 --> 06:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
well that's the city of keem story we
 
06:05:13.590 --> 06:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:05:16.868 --> 06:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
10 kilowatt solar pv array on our city
 
06:05:18.628 --> 06:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
hall that was installed back in june of
 
06:05:20.788 --> 06:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
2010. this was really just a
 
06:05:23.030 --> 06:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
demonstration project it was never meant
 
06:05:25.270 --> 06:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be a significant contributor to our
 
06:05:25.280 --> 06:05:26.548 align:start position:0%
to be a significant contributor to our
electricity

06:05:26.548 --> 06:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
06:05:26.558 --> 06:05:27.750 align:start position:0%
electricity
demand

06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
demand
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
and and really that tiny little solar
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
array that's just a small fraction of
 
06:05:36.470 --> 06:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
what our city hall facility consumes
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
is preventing us from having our city
 
06:05:40.390 --> 06:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
hall building participate in group net
 
06:05:40.400 --> 06:05:41.430 align:start position:0%
hall building participate in group net
metering

06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
metering
 
06:05:43.030 --> 06:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
so the city of keene just started i
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
think you heard from our consultant
 
06:05:44.638 --> 06:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
think you heard from our consultant
earlier

06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:05:47.750 --> 06:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
this evening and and the city of keene
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
just started group net metering and
 
06:05:50.788 --> 06:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
we're not able to include our city hall
 
06:05:52.230 --> 06:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
meter in that we have a couple other
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
meters that aren't able to participate
 
06:05:56.470 --> 06:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
for the same reason but i think that
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'll just stop there that's really what
 
06:06:00.788 --> 06:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say tonight and um happy to
 
06:06:02.628 --> 06:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you appreciate you being here
 
06:06:06.390 --> 06:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
any questions for miss bruner hope i
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you for your
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and we'll move on
 
06:06:16.150 --> 06:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
i love it when
 
06:06:19.270 --> 06:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
testimony is succinct and to the point
 
06:06:22.948 --> 06:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
now i'll call on shane hardner from
 
06:06:29.270 --> 06:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:32.548 --> 06:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
welcome to sdne thank you
 
06:06:34.070 --> 06:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
i have a copy of the letter that was
 
06:06:36.708 --> 06:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier from five of the
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
major corporate
 
06:06:51.430 --> 06:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:54.390 --> 06:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
three minutes please yes
 
06:06:56.788 --> 06:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh chairman vos vice chairman thomas
 
06:06:58.470 --> 06:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
06:07:00.948 --> 06:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify today on sb
 
06:07:03.750 --> 06:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
262. my name is shea hardner and i'm
 
06:07:05.350 --> 06:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
pleased to represent my employer worth
 
06:07:08.070 --> 06:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
in industries in support of this bill
 
06:07:10.788 --> 06:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
worthen is 155 year old family-owned
 
06:07:12.788 --> 06:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturing firm employing
 
06:07:14.390 --> 06:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 200 people in new
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire with our headquarters and two
 
06:07:18.788 --> 06:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
largest manufacturing facilities located
 
06:07:21.190 --> 06:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
just down the road in nashua
 
06:07:23.590 --> 06:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
as a manufacturer of specialty adhesives

coatings coated products and
 
06:07:27.670 --> 06:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
thermoplastic extruded products
 
06:07:29.670 --> 06:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
electricity is a significant part of our
 
06:07:31.270 --> 06:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
operating costs
 
06:07:33.270 --> 06:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy helps businesses like
 
06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
ours cut costs and decrease our exposure
 
06:07:38.390 --> 06:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
to the ups and downs of energy prices
 
06:07:40.310 --> 06:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is also an essential
 
06:07:42.150 --> 06:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
ingredient to meeting our sustainability
 
06:07:44.390 --> 06:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
goals which are predicated both on our
 
06:07:46.390 --> 06:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
belief that worthen has a responsibility
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
to reduce our carbon emissions and on
 
06:07:50.788 --> 06:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
the expectations of our key global
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
customers well-known brands and footwear
 
06:07:55.750 --> 06:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
construction products and consumer goods
 
06:07:58.230 --> 06:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
among others who increasingly require
 
06:07:59.590 --> 06:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
that we contribute to their
 
06:08:02.150 --> 06:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
sustainability goals as part of their
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:07.190 --> 06:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
worthen has a one megawatt rooftop solar
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
array on one of our nashua facilities
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
but our plant could easily use more
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
energy from a larger system and we are a
 
06:08:15.030 --> 06:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
comparatively small electricity user
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
relative to some other companies that
 
06:08:18.548 --> 06:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
operate here in new hampshire
 
06:08:21.510 --> 06:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
if sb 262 passes and raises the one
 
06:08:23.670 --> 06:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap we could explore investing
 
06:08:25.190 --> 06:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
in a larger array than our current
 
06:08:25.200 --> 06:08:26.868 align:start position:0%
in a larger array than our current
system

06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:08:29.910 --> 06:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
sb 262 would enable other existing large
 
06:08:32.150 --> 06:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
electricity users and those that might
 
06:08:33.910 --> 06:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
be considering locating here in new
 
06:08:36.230 --> 06:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire to control a larger percentage
 
06:08:38.390 --> 06:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
of their energy costs and also make
 
06:08:40.390 --> 06:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
significant progress on their renewable
 
06:08:42.788 --> 06:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
energy and emission reduction goals
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
both of these impacts will help make new
 
06:08:46.150 --> 06:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire companies more competitive
 
06:08:49.350 --> 06:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
suppliers in the global market
 
06:08:51.030 --> 06:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
as a manufacturer we think about the
 
06:08:53.190 --> 06:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity a lot renewable
 
06:08:54.948 --> 06:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
energy provides tangible benefits
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
through price predictability reduced air
 
06:08:59.590 --> 06:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
pollution and improved public health
 
06:09:01.670 --> 06:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
we found that investing in on-site solar
 
06:09:03.590 --> 06:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
energy has helped our company insulate
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves from some of the business
 
06:09:08.708 --> 06:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
risks of high electricity prices
 
06:09:10.230 --> 06:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire should foster these kinds
 
06:09:12.070 --> 06:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
of investments to stay competitive and
 
06:09:14.150 --> 06:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
ensure we don't lose the companies jobs
 
06:09:16.310 --> 06:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
and employees of the future to states
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
with stronger clean energy policies
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
as you consider how best to promote
 
06:09:23.590 --> 06:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
economic growth in our state i ask that
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
you consider how strong clean energy
 
06:09:27.190 --> 06:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
policies keep the business community
 
06:09:29.270 --> 06:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
strong and i hope you will all support
 
06:09:33.590 --> 06:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:33.600 --> 06:09:34.628 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

06:09:34.628 --> 06:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
06:09:37.030 --> 06:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
two minutes and 30 seconds
 
06:09:38.470 --> 06:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
i love it
 
06:09:40.150 --> 06:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
06:09:42.470 --> 06:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
06:09:43.830 --> 06:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:09:46.708 --> 06:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh actually two parts
 
06:09:47.910 --> 06:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
first uh
 
06:09:50.230 --> 06:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in your letter that 80
 
06:09:52.868 --> 06:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
threshold to avoid uh of self
 
06:09:52.878 --> 06:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
threshold to avoid uh of self
consumption

06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
06:09:56.070 --> 06:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
to avoid cost shifting can you address
 
06:09:57.670 --> 06:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
me to the part of the law right this i
 
06:09:58.948 --> 06:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
asked the question for the gentleman of
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
doe he said he couldn't find it in the
 
06:10:03.430 --> 06:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill do you know where it's located i
 
06:10:05.590 --> 06:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
cannot direct you to that exact okay
 
06:10:07.670 --> 06:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
06:10:08.788 --> 06:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
there is
 
06:10:10.470 --> 06:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
i would believe and tell me if i'm wrong
 
06:10:12.150 --> 06:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
but i believe there's absolutely nothing
 
06:10:13.910 --> 06:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
that stops your company or any other
 
06:10:16.070 --> 06:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
company from putting in as much solar as
 
06:10:17.510 --> 06:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
they want
 
06:10:18.310 --> 06:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:10:20.868 --> 06:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
conforming to local zoning laws that
 
06:10:23.110 --> 06:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's this law is not required for you
 
06:10:25.990 --> 06:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
to put in a 5 or 6 or 10 or 15 megawatt
 
06:10:27.830 --> 06:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
solar system provided you comply with
 
06:10:29.990 --> 06:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
all the local zoning requirements
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
it does not prevent us from the proposed
 
06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
law and we could put it however much we
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
want but you can't net meter if it's
 
06:10:39.110 --> 06:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
larger than a megawatt i understand but
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that stops you from
 
06:10:42.230 --> 06:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
doing that and can producing as much
 
06:10:45.590 --> 06:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
electricity as you need to to power your
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
facility correct okay then it just means
 
06:10:50.150 --> 06:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
that when we aren't
 
06:10:50.160 --> 06:10:50.948 align:start position:0%
that when we aren't
like

06:10:50.948 --> 06:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
when we're not when we're generating
 
06:10:54.390 --> 06:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
electricity but not using it like on the
 
06:10:58.868 --> 06:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:01.510 --> 06:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
06:11:03.910 --> 06:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will move on and thank
 
06:11:05.830 --> 06:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony and
 
06:11:09.750 --> 06:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:11.110 --> 06:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
next up
 
06:11:12.150 --> 06:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
let's have
 
06:11:12.160 --> 06:11:13.510 align:start position:0%
let's have
a

06:11:13.510 --> 06:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
dynamic duo do some testifying for us
 
06:11:24.548 --> 06:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:26.708 --> 06:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
killed two birds with one stone
 
06:11:28.150 --> 06:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm still gonna restrict you to
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
06:11:33.750 --> 06:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:34.868 --> 06:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:11:37.190 --> 06:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and committee
 
06:11:39.510 --> 06:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
for allowing us to speak to this bill um
 
06:11:41.510 --> 06:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
my name is dan clapp i've been leading

resources as everyone has mentioned
earlier

06:12:02.310 --> 06:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:12:04.948 --> 06:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
that is being addressed in docket 16576
 
06:12:07.030 --> 06:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's a puc
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is about making structural
 
06:12:10.628 --> 06:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
changes to the net metering rules that
 
06:12:12.390 --> 06:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
allow businesses to manage their energy
 
06:12:12.400 --> 06:12:13.430 align:start position:0%
allow businesses to manage their energy
costs

06:12:13.430 --> 06:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
costs
 
06:12:15.430 --> 06:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
lock in long-term predictable
 
06:12:17.830 --> 06:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
energy savings and with behind the meter
 
06:12:20.548 --> 06:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
solar over the last two months alone our
 
06:12:22.548 --> 06:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire businesses especially in
 
06:12:24.788 --> 06:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
unisource and ever to ever ever source
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
territory have seen default energy
 
06:12:30.548 --> 06:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
prices in the range of 21 to 22 cents
 
06:12:33.910 --> 06:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour in in february in
 
06:12:36.070 --> 06:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
in february and 12 to 13 and a half
 
06:12:38.628 --> 06:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour just last month
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
so yes the energy default rates will go
 
06:12:44.230 --> 06:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
back to the seven to nine cent range
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
but we know that it's going to continue
 
06:12:47.590 --> 06:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:12:49.750 --> 06:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
unpredictable in the foreseeable future
 
06:12:50.948 --> 06:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
especially with
 
06:12:52.788 --> 06:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
06:12:54.470 --> 06:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
capacity constraints
 
06:12:56.948 --> 06:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
this bill will encourage on
 
06:12:56.958 --> 06:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
this bill will encourage on
on-site

06:12:58.310 --> 06:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
on-site
 
06:13:00.548 --> 06:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
rooftop behind the meter solar storage
 
06:13:02.548 --> 06:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
that can allow businesses to hedge and
 
06:13:04.788 --> 06:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
lock in their energy costs businesses
 
06:13:06.390 --> 06:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
are asking for this
 
06:13:10.470 --> 06:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
as you've just seen with prior testimony
 
06:13:10.480 --> 06:13:11.430 align:start position:0%
as you've just seen with prior testimony
um

06:13:11.430 --> 06:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:13.830 --> 06:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
one thing i do want to mention is you
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
know if you look at the iso new england
 
06:13:18.230 --> 06:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
pv forecast report
 
06:13:22.230 --> 06:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
from 2021 it estimates that by 2030 new
 
06:13:23.830 --> 06:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire will see
 
06:13:26.708 --> 06:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
200 and about 300 megawatts of installed
 
06:13:28.548 --> 06:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
solar capacity so we're about 3x where
 
06:13:30.230 --> 06:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're at now
 
06:13:32.470 --> 06:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
that is the last
 
06:13:34.708 --> 06:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
place last in new england out of all
 
06:13:37.190 --> 06:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
states and the next
 
06:13:39.270 --> 06:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
state above us would be rhode island at
 
06:13:41.110 --> 06:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
north of 600 megawatts of installed
 
06:13:43.430 --> 06:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
capacity what does this mean
 
06:13:45.510 --> 06:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
this means that while every other state
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
is working in adopting smart policy to
 
06:13:52.070 --> 06:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
reduce peak load new hampshire is way
 
06:13:54.628 --> 06:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
behind and what we're going to see is
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
all these transmission costs get shifted
 
06:13:59.670 --> 06:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire ratepayers over the
 
06:14:02.310 --> 06:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future we need to act now we
 
06:14:04.868 --> 06:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
need to be smart and encourage and
 
06:14:04.878 --> 06:14:06.150 align:start position:0%
need to be smart and encourage and
expand

06:14:06.150 --> 06:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
expand
 
06:14:08.868 --> 06:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
on site behind the meter solar
 
06:14:12.310 --> 06:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to go through um the 30
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
seconds in four sections
 
06:14:15.120 --> 06:14:16.948 align:start position:0%
seconds in four sections
obviously

06:14:16.948 --> 06:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
06:14:19.830 --> 06:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i'll just i'll just remind that in
 
06:14:22.868 --> 06:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
statute 362 a9 it spells out the general
 
06:14:25.190 --> 06:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
court finds it is in the public's best
 
06:14:25.200 --> 06:14:26.230 align:start position:0%
court finds it is in the public's best
interest

06:14:26.230 --> 06:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
interest
 
06:14:28.470 --> 06:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
to stimulate the deployment of ders
 
06:14:29.990 --> 06:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources in new
 
06:14:32.230 --> 06:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and eliminate unreasonable
 
06:14:32.240 --> 06:14:33.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire and eliminate unreasonable
barriers

06:14:33.350 --> 06:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
barriers
 
06:14:33.360 --> 06:14:34.150 align:start position:0%
barriers
so

06:14:34.150 --> 06:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:14:35.830 --> 06:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and we'll open it up for
 
06:14:38.150 --> 06:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay two minutes and 58
 
06:14:38.160 --> 06:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
questions okay two minutes and 58
seconds

06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
06:14:41.830 --> 06:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah two minutes 58 seconds mr monahan i
 
06:14:45.030 --> 06:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
will give you two minutes if you need it
 
06:14:46.628 --> 06:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and i'll try to use less
 
06:14:48.310 --> 06:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
than that um as the community knows i'm
 
06:14:49.750 --> 06:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
around a lot so i'm happy to meet with
 
06:14:51.110 --> 06:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
you individually or if you have a work
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
session or subcommittee in this
 
06:14:55.030 --> 06:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
let me start off by asking uh quickly
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
trying to answer two questions that
 
06:14:58.390 --> 06:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative harrington raised
 
06:14:58.400 --> 06:14:59.270 align:start position:0%
representative harrington raised
um

06:14:59.270 --> 06:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:01.750 --> 06:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh the first is where is the 80 and i
 
06:15:03.590 --> 06:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
think representative in um
 
06:15:05.030 --> 06:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative griffin he's almost a
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative of the kitty but uh griff
 
06:15:09.350 --> 06:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
described that there's a calculation in
 
06:15:10.868 --> 06:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
section the very early part of the
 
06:15:14.310 --> 06:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
section which is the 100 up to 125 of
 
06:15:16.470 --> 06:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
the 5 megawatts and so i don't think it
 
06:15:18.548 --> 06:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
would be objectionable for us to spell
 
06:15:20.230 --> 06:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
that out what it means but you do need
 
06:15:22.230 --> 06:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
to do a calculation to get there
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
and then the the question with regard to
 
06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing preventing a customer
 
06:15:30.230 --> 06:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
from installing more than one megawatt
 
06:15:30.240 --> 06:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
from installing more than one megawatt
um

06:15:31.110 --> 06:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
06:15:34.948 --> 06:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
the answer to that from the
 
06:15:36.628 --> 06:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
folks from uh
 
06:15:38.150 --> 06:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
that testified before is right they can
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
do that
 
06:15:41.990 --> 06:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
but there's a perverse hole in the the
 
06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
system here and i think this is why
 
06:15:44.240 --> 06:15:45.190 align:start position:0%
system here and i think this is why
um

06:15:45.190 --> 06:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:47.910 --> 06:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1481 was filed a couple years
 
06:15:49.590 --> 06:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
ago and i think some of the sponsors
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
from that bill were here um the way it
 
06:15:52.948 --> 06:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
would work now is if a customer
 
06:15:55.030 --> 06:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
installed something more than a megawatt
 
06:15:57.030 --> 06:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
and on nights and weekends they pushed
 
06:15:58.868 --> 06:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
power back out into the grid they get
 
06:16:01.750 --> 06:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
paid nothing for that so it becomes this
 
06:16:04.868 --> 06:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh which we think was unintended that if
 
06:16:06.470 --> 06:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh something is pushed back into the
 
06:16:08.070 --> 06:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
grid there should be some compensation
 
06:16:10.310 --> 06:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
for it the way the system is today this
 
06:16:12.788 --> 06:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
there's no compensation for that so
 
06:16:14.708 --> 06:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
that's what this section the bills is
 
06:16:17.190 --> 06:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
attempting to resolve certainly as griff
 
06:16:18.788 --> 06:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
identified as a public policy question
 
06:16:21.430 --> 06:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
as what should that credit be um but
 
06:16:23.030 --> 06:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
that ultimately is the big hole that
 
06:16:24.070 --> 06:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to fix with largest
 
06:16:25.430 --> 06:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
customers that
 
06:16:27.270 --> 06:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
have enough rooftop but then they stop
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i see my time might be up so
 
06:16:31.590 --> 06:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to
 
06:16:32.948 --> 06:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
meet with you and i'll get ahead of my
 
06:16:34.708 --> 06:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
client here and say that dan is
 
06:16:36.548 --> 06:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
available and you can come visit his
 
06:16:38.070 --> 06:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
shop in brentwood
 
06:16:40.470 --> 06:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
right then so but thank you for the time
 
06:16:42.868 --> 06:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
great thank you questions for these two
 
06:16:45.430 --> 06:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
gentlemen mr representative lewicki
 
06:16:48.150 --> 06:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you um i'm
 
06:16:48.160 --> 06:16:49.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you um i'm
hearing

06:16:49.270 --> 06:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:16:51.350 --> 06:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
that people want to have rooftop we're
 
06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
primarily talking about rooftop solar
 
06:16:53.520 --> 06:16:54.548 align:start position:0%
primarily talking about rooftop solar
and

06:16:54.548 --> 06:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:56.868 --> 06:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
what we need in the winter is power from
 
06:16:58.230 --> 06:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
four to uh
 
06:17:01.190 --> 06:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
nine at night and then if what good does
 
06:17:02.948 --> 06:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
it do us to have a whole lot of excess
 
06:17:05.190 --> 06:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
power on a weekend when the rest of the
 
06:17:14.708 --> 06:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:17.110 --> 06:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
so you're talking the x the
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
exports of the grid during the weekend
 
06:17:20.160 --> 06:17:21.190 align:start position:0%
exports of the grid during the weekend
sure

06:17:21.190 --> 06:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:17:23.110 --> 06:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
that would be beneficial
 
06:17:24.470 --> 06:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
to us
 
06:17:25.830 --> 06:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
because then we don't have to fire any
 
06:17:27.910 --> 06:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
additional resources to meet any of that
 
06:17:33.110 --> 06:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:34.948 --> 06:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
up okay but what is the benefit to the
 
06:17:37.990 --> 06:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
grid and to the other customers and i'm
 
06:17:39.830 --> 06:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
saying and who's going to uh since
 
06:17:41.430 --> 06:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
you're gonna you always want can only
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
put out energy during the day when the
 
06:17:44.708 --> 06:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
sun's shining
 
06:17:46.548 --> 06:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
what happens at heavy demand times at
 
06:17:49.030 --> 06:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
night who do we depend on
 
06:17:51.750 --> 06:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why we we have base load and
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
when we build out our continue to build
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
our smart grid we're also going to have
 
06:17:59.190 --> 06:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
storage that can respond to that as well
 
06:18:02.230 --> 06:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
on off peak times
 
06:18:04.470 --> 06:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a question
 
06:18:06.708 --> 06:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh mr chairman thank you
 
06:18:07.910 --> 06:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions just to follow
 
06:18:10.150 --> 06:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
up mr moynihan i'm trying to follow the
 
06:18:12.470 --> 06:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
logic of this uh page one
 
06:18:14.948 --> 06:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
six and seven because i tell you it uh
 
06:18:17.670 --> 06:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm i guess i'm confused on it it talks
 
06:18:19.510 --> 06:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
about the total peak
 
06:18:21.830 --> 06:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
generating capacity up to including one
 
06:18:23.350 --> 06:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
megawatt okay that's pretty
 
06:18:25.590 --> 06:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
straightforward then it's talking about
 
06:18:28.150 --> 06:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
125 percent of the customers average
 
06:18:31.510 --> 06:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
electric consumption over 12 months if
 
06:18:33.910 --> 06:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
greater than 1 megawatt but less than 5
 
06:18:33.920 --> 06:18:35.110 align:start position:0%
greater than 1 megawatt but less than 5
megawatts

06:18:35.110 --> 06:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
06:18:35.120 --> 06:18:36.390 align:start position:0%
megawatts
so

06:18:36.390 --> 06:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:40.590 --> 06:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:43.670 --> 06:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
4.9 megawatts was the consumption over
 
06:18:45.910 --> 06:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
the past 12 months you're saying they
 
06:18:49.270 --> 06:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
could put out 125 percent of that
 
06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:56.628 --> 06:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
but i think it's on the count of years
 
06:18:59.350 --> 06:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
yeah you're saying 4.9 megawatts is an
 
06:19:00.390 --> 06:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
06:19:02.868 --> 06:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
cumulative load over an annual basis yes
 
06:19:05.110 --> 06:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
for the 12 months they would be allowed
 
06:19:05.120 --> 06:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
for the 12 months they would be allowed
to

06:19:06.070 --> 06:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:19:10.628 --> 06:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
put up to 5 megawatts ac as the cap
 
06:19:12.868 --> 06:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
and just this this wording is is very
 
06:19:14.230 --> 06:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
confusing i'm just i'm just trying to
 
06:19:16.390 --> 06:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
follow the logic here one is in
 
06:19:16.400 --> 06:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
follow the logic here one is in
consumption

06:19:17.750 --> 06:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
06:19:20.390 --> 06:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
which is in megawatt hours the second
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
one is
 
06:19:24.150 --> 06:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
in production which is in megawatts as
 
06:19:25.510 --> 06:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
you well aware they're two different
 
06:19:25.520 --> 06:19:26.390 align:start position:0%
you well aware they're two different
things

06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:19:29.270 --> 06:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand how you can size
 
06:19:29.280 --> 06:19:30.070 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand how you can size
a

06:19:30.070 --> 06:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:19:32.788 --> 06:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
generator based on the customer's
 
06:19:34.788 --> 06:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
average electric consumption which is in
 
06:19:37.750 --> 06:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours over a 12-month period
 
06:19:37.760 --> 06:19:38.868 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours over a 12-month period
versus

06:19:38.868 --> 06:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
versus
 
06:19:41.430 --> 06:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
how big this system can be which is in
 
06:19:41.440 --> 06:19:43.110 align:start position:0%
how big this system can be which is in
megawatts

06:19:43.110 --> 06:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
06:19:44.548 --> 06:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
06:19:47.110 --> 06:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
um if this this helps this is how i was
 
06:19:48.788 --> 06:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
thinking of it i have sorry i have two
 
06:19:50.310 --> 06:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
million in my head so just for
 
06:19:52.868 --> 06:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
calculation purposes let's say they use
 
06:19:54.868 --> 06:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
two million kilowatt hours on an annual
 
06:19:54.878 --> 06:19:55.830 align:start position:0%
two million kilowatt hours on an annual
basis

06:19:55.830 --> 06:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
basis
 
06:19:57.910 --> 06:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
that weaken size and array according to
 
06:20:00.150 --> 06:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
this language at 125 percent of that so
 
06:20:04.468 --> 06:20:04.478 align:start position:0%
we could size an array to match 2.5 or 2
 
06:20:07.670 --> 06:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
2 500 000 kilowatt hours that array
 
06:20:09.590 --> 06:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:20:11.750 --> 06:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
about a 2 or 2.1
 
06:20:16.390 --> 06:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
kilowatt dc array about a 1.6 or 1.7
 
06:20:16.400 --> 06:20:17.590 align:start position:0%
kilowatt dc array about a 1.6 or 1.7
ac

06:20:17.590 --> 06:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
ac
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
inverter size array to meet that 2.5
 
06:20:25.110 --> 06:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay megawatt hours follow up mr shamus
 
06:20:26.390 --> 06:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about this really quick
 
06:20:28.628 --> 06:20:28.638 align:start position:0%
the okay so what you're saying is you
 
06:20:31.190 --> 06:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
take the amount of consumption in an
 
06:20:33.830 --> 06:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
average for a year and then you'd say
 
06:20:35.830 --> 06:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
using somewhere around 13 and a half
 
06:20:38.628 --> 06:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
percent capacity factor which iso new
 
06:20:41.030 --> 06:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
england uses for uh for new hampshire
 
06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
turn that into a size you needed to
 
06:20:46.548 --> 06:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
produce 125 percent of that consumption
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
and that would be the size of your panel
 
06:20:51.510 --> 06:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
but not to exceed five megawatts correct
 
06:20:53.030 --> 06:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay but it could have been written a
 
06:20:56.390 --> 06:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
lot better the 80 percent consumed in
 
06:20:56.400 --> 06:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
lot better the 80 percent consumed in
the

06:20:57.110 --> 06:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:20:59.910 --> 06:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
i defy without your explanation sir i
 
06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
think 90 of those people in this room
 
06:21:03.430 --> 06:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
had no idea what that statement meant
 
06:21:05.270 --> 06:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that didn't work that provides a
 
06:21:07.510 --> 06:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of a buffer in case you know
 
06:21:09.590 --> 06:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
you've got evs coming in and
 
06:21:11.190 --> 06:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
other electrifications yeah i understand
 
06:21:12.788 --> 06:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
it now but you certainly by reading it
 
06:21:14.948 --> 06:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear i i don't know who wrote it
 
06:21:17.190 --> 06:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
but okay we can certainly clarify that
 
06:21:18.788 --> 06:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
but i think the intention is to say as
 
06:21:20.788 --> 06:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
we get into these bigger systems we want
 
06:21:25.910 --> 06:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:27.670 --> 06:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay gentlemen we have to move on we
 
06:21:30.548 --> 06:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
have four more people who want to speak
 
06:21:32.628 --> 06:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
in the next
 
06:21:34.548 --> 06:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
eight minutes so that's going to be
 
06:21:36.150 --> 06:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
about two minutes a piece and i'll call
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um mr chairman and
 
06:21:50.230 --> 06:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
06:21:51.830 --> 06:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
my name is heidi kroll i work at
 
06:21:53.510 --> 06:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
gallagher callahan and gartrell and i
 
06:21:55.510 --> 06:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
represent uh here today the granite
 
06:21:57.190 --> 06:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
state hydropower association and
 
06:21:59.350 --> 06:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
monadnock paper mills
 
06:22:02.468 --> 06:22:02.478 align:start position:0%
and we are in support of the bill
 
06:22:04.468 --> 06:22:04.478 align:start position:0%
i will just add uh
 
06:22:06.548 --> 06:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
two quick things try to stay under my
 
06:22:08.150 --> 06:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
06:22:11.670 --> 06:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
we do support the section of the bill
 
06:22:13.190 --> 06:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
06:22:16.868 --> 06:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
a small customer generator for example
 
06:22:16.878 --> 06:22:17.910 align:start position:0%
a small customer generator for example
the

06:22:17.910 --> 06:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:22:20.070 --> 06:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know fire station with a few solar
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
panels on the roof to also be able to
 
06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
participate in group net metering
 
06:22:27.910 --> 06:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
as you are aware this small hydro
 
06:22:30.390 --> 06:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
facilities in new hampshire
 
06:22:32.628 --> 06:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
participate in group net metering
 
06:22:34.468 --> 06:22:34.478 align:start position:0%
and they have come across this problem
 
06:22:34.478 --> 06:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
and they have come across this problem
where

06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:22:36.788 --> 06:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
a small
 
06:22:36.798 --> 06:22:37.990 align:start position:0%
a small
municipal

06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
06:22:40.468 --> 06:22:40.478 align:start position:0%
facility or a school has not been able
 
06:22:40.478 --> 06:22:41.190 align:start position:0%
facility or a school has not been able
to

06:22:41.190 --> 06:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:22:45.750 --> 06:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
similarly in the case of monadnock paper
 
06:22:47.520 --> 06:22:49.270 align:start position:0%
similarly in the case of monadnock paper
mills

06:22:49.270 --> 06:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
mills
 
06:22:51.350 --> 06:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
right now they meet about half of their
 
06:22:53.670 --> 06:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
generation needs on site with their
 
06:22:56.070 --> 06:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
hydros they purchase the other half in
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
the competitive market and if they were
 
06:23:00.548 --> 06:23:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:02.548 --> 06:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
meet part of their needs through a
 
06:23:04.548 --> 06:23:04.558 align:start position:0%
groupnet metering arrangement
 
06:23:06.868 --> 06:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
they would like to do that as well
 
06:23:09.030 --> 06:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then the last section of a couple of
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
sections of the bill
 
06:23:13.270 --> 06:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
simply providing some transparency and
 
06:23:16.150 --> 06:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
some clarity and some uniformity
 
06:23:19.430 --> 06:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
around the interconnection processes and
 
06:23:22.468 --> 06:23:22.478 align:start position:0%
procedures we support that
 
06:23:22.478 --> 06:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
procedures we support that
and

06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
with that i'm happy to answer any
 
06:23:26.150 --> 06:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
give my time to somebody else
 
06:23:31.190 --> 06:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
beautifully done a minute in 38 seconds
 
06:23:34.868 --> 06:23:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:37.750 --> 06:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move on and i'll call
 
06:23:43.830 --> 06:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
for your two minutes
 
06:23:49.350 --> 06:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh to the committee uh sam
 
06:23:50.548 --> 06:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
evans brown i'm the executive director
 
06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
of clean energy new hampshire i will be
 
06:23:53.750 --> 06:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
brief i'm batting cleanup here i think a
 
06:23:55.270 --> 06:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
lot of the sections of this bill have
 
06:23:56.788 --> 06:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
been addressed already so i won't be
 
06:23:58.948 --> 06:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
redundant i think the one section that
 
06:24:01.110 --> 06:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps should be emphasized is the
 
06:24:03.910 --> 06:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
discussion of a study of interconnection
 
06:24:07.910 --> 06:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
costs we had a meeting in the fall with
 
06:24:09.990 --> 06:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
several medium-sized solar developers
 
06:24:11.510 --> 06:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the utilities in which we discussed
 
06:24:13.270 --> 06:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
the escalation of these costs that that
 
06:24:15.190 --> 06:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
our members have been seeing over the
 
06:24:18.628 --> 06:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
past few years and suffice to say uh the
 
06:24:21.190 --> 06:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
the escalation has been uneven there are
 
06:24:23.190 --> 06:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh different standards that are applied
 
06:24:25.990 --> 06:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
by different utilities as to what types
 
06:24:28.230 --> 06:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
of requirements they are putting on
 
06:24:30.390 --> 06:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
solar developers when they have
 
06:24:33.670 --> 06:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
medium-sized projects say over 500 kw
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
less than one megawatt that are
 
06:24:37.830 --> 06:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
interconnecting to the distribution grid
 
06:24:39.910 --> 06:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of those costs are things that
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
benefit all ratepayers for instance in
 
06:24:43.590 --> 06:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
the installation of what are called
 
06:24:46.310 --> 06:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
reclosers in in the place of fuses when
 
06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
you have a recloser on the distribution
 
06:24:50.230 --> 06:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
grid instead of a fuse when there is a
 
06:24:53.190 --> 06:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
short the utility can uh try to reclose
 
06:24:55.030 --> 06:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
it remotely instead of rolling a truck
 
06:24:56.708 --> 06:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
which saves cost to all rate payers and
 
06:24:57.990 --> 06:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is a cost that is being put onto
 
06:25:00.150 --> 06:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
solar developers currently so a
 
06:25:02.948 --> 06:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
discussion of how to equitably share
 
06:25:05.190 --> 06:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
those costs as well as
 
06:25:07.510 --> 06:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
what costs should be applied
 
06:25:09.590 --> 06:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
uniformly when when
 
06:25:11.110 --> 06:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
having this type of interconnection onto
 
06:25:12.708 --> 06:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
the distribution grid is a really
 
06:25:14.230 --> 06:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
important question that should be asked
 
06:25:15.670 --> 06:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
and answered by the experts at the
 
06:25:16.868 --> 06:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission in the
 
06:25:19.510 --> 06:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
06:25:19.520 --> 06:25:20.708 align:start position:0%
department of energy
wonderful

06:25:20.708 --> 06:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
06:25:22.548 --> 06:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
minute 30.
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
question from representative harrington
 
06:25:26.788 --> 06:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you take my question i'm
 
06:25:28.150 --> 06:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
not sure if you're the right person to
 
06:25:29.830 --> 06:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
ask but well i'm going to give a shot
 
06:25:32.150 --> 06:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
anyways on the top of page three of the
 
06:25:34.868 --> 06:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
bill it talks about facilities eligible
 
06:25:36.310 --> 06:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
for net metering tariff under this
 
06:25:38.390 --> 06:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
section for customer generates larger
 
06:25:40.230 --> 06:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
than 100 kilowatts but up to one
 
06:25:42.628 --> 06:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
megawatt is that a typo should that also
 
06:25:45.990 --> 06:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
be 500 uh i you in fact are asking the
 
06:25:47.110 --> 06:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
right person only because the person
 
06:25:48.708 --> 06:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
sitting next to me pointed out this typo
 
06:25:50.230 --> 06:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
to me moments before i came up so i
 
06:25:51.510 --> 06:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
believe that yes that is a drafting
 
06:25:57.990 --> 06:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:59.670 --> 06:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions
 
06:26:01.670 --> 06:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
06:26:03.430 --> 06:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:26:04.708 --> 06:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:26:04.718 --> 06:26:05.830 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:26:05.830 --> 06:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:07.910 --> 06:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think the points that you make i had
 
06:26:09.590 --> 06:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
originally referred to this as a cleanup
 
06:26:11.430 --> 06:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
bill and when i you started talking
 
06:26:13.030 --> 06:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
about the
 
06:26:15.510 --> 06:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies in the interconnection
 
06:26:18.150 --> 06:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh costs and how they're attributed
 
06:26:19.910 --> 06:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like a very important thing for
 
06:26:21.670 --> 06:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
us to get resolved so
 
06:26:24.390 --> 06:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
i wanted to sort of go back to that and
 
06:26:26.708 --> 06:26:26.718 align:start position:0%
um the other sort of back to the future
 
06:26:29.350 --> 06:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
thing that i'm aware of is um i believe
 
06:26:31.990 --> 06:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
mr roberts referred to
 
06:26:35.750 --> 06:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh hb 466 in a prior
 
06:26:38.070 --> 06:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
a prior session which i actually did the
 
06:26:39.830 --> 06:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on that and we
 
06:26:42.070 --> 06:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
had originally tried to raise uh the
 
06:26:44.948 --> 06:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
small generator cap to 500 kilowatts at
 
06:26:47.830 --> 06:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
that time so it's not a new thing that
 
06:26:49.750 --> 06:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
that be the
 
06:26:52.070 --> 06:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
the rate for small generators it's it's
 
06:26:53.670 --> 06:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's an effort to go back to the future
 
06:26:54.548 --> 06:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:26:56.868 --> 06:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh that we had tried that before and it
 
06:26:59.270 --> 06:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
came back from the senate at 125 so in
 
06:27:00.868 --> 06:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference it had been
 
06:27:02.310 --> 06:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
lowered by the senate as is my
 
06:27:04.390 --> 06:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
recollection on that and then it was
 
06:27:07.990 --> 06:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
vetoed but so it sounds to me like
 
06:27:08.000 --> 06:27:09.670 align:start position:0%
vetoed but so it sounds to me like
between

06:27:09.670 --> 06:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:27:12.310 --> 06:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
raising the limit for small generators
 
06:27:15.510 --> 06:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh from 100 to 500 kilowatts and also
 
06:27:17.430 --> 06:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
the interconnected piece those both seem
 
06:27:19.830 --> 06:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:21.350 --> 06:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say housekeeping items
 
06:27:22.708 --> 06:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
but they seem to be things that we've
 
06:27:24.868 --> 06:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
been trying to do as a state
 
06:27:27.670 --> 06:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
for a while now okay and you have good
 
06:27:29.350 --> 06:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
history so i'm just wondering if you
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
could comment on that i you know i would
 
06:27:33.670 --> 06:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
add to that that the the puc was was
 
06:27:35.350 --> 06:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
asked to consider this question of what
 
06:27:37.190 --> 06:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
should the definition of a of a small
 
06:27:38.788 --> 06:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
customer generator be
 
06:27:40.548 --> 06:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
and so so it's it's one that we have
 
06:27:42.070 --> 06:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
been grappling with as a state for a
 
06:27:44.230 --> 06:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
long time uh i think our organization
 
06:27:46.628 --> 06:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
our members believe that 500 is a more
 
06:27:49.190 --> 06:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
rational cutoff as it would allow a lot
 
06:27:51.110 --> 06:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
of these sort of medium-sized businesses
 
06:27:53.590 --> 06:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to get some certainty
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
as to what their electric prices are
 
06:27:57.110 --> 06:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to be and i think coming into this
 
06:27:58.788 --> 06:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
year when we've had such dramatic
 
06:28:00.628 --> 06:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
escalations and what energy is costing
 
06:28:02.468 --> 06:28:02.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents being able to
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
lock in your price for 25 years by by
 
06:28:07.910 --> 06:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
investing in your own on-site generation
 
06:28:09.750 --> 06:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
is a really powerful tool for economic
 
06:28:11.510 --> 06:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
development here in the state and and
 
06:28:13.350 --> 06:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
opening up that possibility to these
 
06:28:14.948 --> 06:28:14.958 align:start position:0%
medium-sized businesses think grocery
 
06:28:17.190 --> 06:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
stores you know big box stores that have
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of roof space to host host a lot
 
06:28:22.310 --> 06:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
of a lot of solar i think is a it would
 
06:28:23.510 --> 06:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
be a
 
06:28:25.270 --> 06:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
prudent public policy decision by this
 
06:28:26.628 --> 06:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
body and
 
06:28:26.638 --> 06:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
body and
may

06:28:27.590 --> 06:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
may
 
06:28:30.310 --> 06:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
follow up and the last thing i would ask
 
06:28:33.590 --> 06:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
is are you aware of what small generator
 
06:28:35.430 --> 06:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
caps are in other states because i don't
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
know we often look around us to see what
 
06:28:38.708 --> 06:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
other people are doing i i don't know
 
06:28:40.390 --> 06:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
why we were trying to raise it to 500 in
 
06:28:42.548 --> 06:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
the first place i i do believe that some
 
06:28:44.468 --> 06:28:44.478 align:start position:0%
of the neighboring states uh i think
 
06:28:46.468 --> 06:28:46.478 align:start position:0%
that question is better asked to to
 
06:28:48.390 --> 06:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
folks who who perhaps operate businesses
 
06:28:50.628 --> 06:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
in neighboring states but but it is my
 
06:28:52.788 --> 06:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
rough sketchy recollection that 500 is a
 
06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
cutoff that is used in some of our
 
06:28:56.628 --> 06:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
neighboring states as well but um
 
06:28:57.910 --> 06:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
i may be shooting from the hip a little
 
06:28:59.670 --> 06:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
bit there
 
06:29:01.030 --> 06:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:29:03.110 --> 06:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:29:05.590 --> 06:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
06:29:07.110 --> 06:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
two more people who would like to speak
 
06:29:08.948 --> 06:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
and then one late
 
06:29:08.958 --> 06:29:10.868 align:start position:0%
and then one late
arrival

06:29:10.868 --> 06:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
arrival
 
06:29:13.110 --> 06:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
but before i call on any of those people
 
06:29:16.070 --> 06:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
i want to address senator waters
 
06:29:19.190 --> 06:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
senator waters is the prime sponsor of
 
06:29:20.548 --> 06:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
the next bill
 
06:29:22.230 --> 06:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
which is senate bill
 
06:29:22.240 --> 06:29:23.750 align:start position:0%
which is senate bill
264.

06:29:23.750 --> 06:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
264.
 
06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
so senator waters would it be acceptable
 
06:29:28.070 --> 06:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
to you if we extended this public
 
06:29:29.830 --> 06:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
hearing by another five minutes to let
 
06:29:35.590 --> 06:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:36.628 --> 06:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:29:38.628 --> 06:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
in that case we'll move forward and i'll
 
06:29:40.070 --> 06:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
call on the next speaker and that is
 
06:29:42.788 --> 06:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
mark brown of the consumer energy
 
06:29:42.798 --> 06:29:57.190 align:start position:0%
mark brown of the consumer energy
alliance

06:29:57.190 --> 06:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:58.548 --> 06:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
06:30:00.468 --> 06:30:00.478 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is mark
 
06:30:02.628 --> 06:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
brown i'm executive director of new
 
06:30:04.708 --> 06:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
england for consumer energy alliance we
 
06:30:06.548 --> 06:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
are a nationwide trade association made
 
06:30:08.310 --> 06:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
up of both energy producers and
 
06:30:08.320 --> 06:30:09.510 align:start position:0%
up of both energy producers and
consumers

06:30:09.510 --> 06:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
06:30:11.830 --> 06:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh supporting all the above energy
 
06:30:11.840 --> 06:30:13.030 align:start position:0%
uh supporting all the above energy
strategies

06:30:13.030 --> 06:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
06:30:15.510 --> 06:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
um i'll be brief i'm not going to take
 
06:30:17.190 --> 06:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
up too much of the committee's time i've
 
06:30:18.390 --> 06:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
presented the committee before with
 
06:30:19.670 --> 06:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
studies that showed that there is cost
 
06:30:19.680 --> 06:30:20.708 align:start position:0%
studies that showed that there is cost
shifting

06:30:20.708 --> 06:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
06:30:23.110 --> 06:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
i think the most significant one being
 
06:30:24.788 --> 06:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
the study that frank wallach out of
 
06:30:26.628 --> 06:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
stanford did showing that from
 
06:30:29.110 --> 06:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
essentially 2003 on
 
06:30:31.750 --> 06:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
all of the ious in california all the
 
06:30:33.350 --> 06:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
dish the increase in the distribution
 
06:30:34.788 --> 06:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
costs were attributed to behind the
 
06:30:37.110 --> 06:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
meter and distributed generation
 
06:30:38.788 --> 06:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
um i want to address a few things that
 
06:30:40.788 --> 06:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
were brought up um
 
06:30:42.548 --> 06:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
representation you brought up about
 
06:30:44.708 --> 06:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
compensation above my one megawatt
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
purple requires
 
06:30:46.558 --> 06:30:47.430 align:start position:0%
purple requires
that

06:30:47.430 --> 06:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:30:49.990 --> 06:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know any facility above one megawatt
 
06:30:51.750 --> 06:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
receive the avoided cost
 
06:30:53.590 --> 06:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
so at least in new hampshire right it
 
06:30:54.868 --> 06:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get default rate it would get
 
06:30:57.030 --> 06:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
avoided costs for anything they export
 
06:30:59.270 --> 06:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
so they do receive compensation
 
06:31:01.510 --> 06:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
they do receive some compensation
 
06:31:01.520 --> 06:31:02.628 align:start position:0%
they do receive some compensation
um

06:31:02.628 --> 06:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:03.990 --> 06:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think one way to look at the cost
 
06:31:05.750 --> 06:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
shift of this is we've heard a lot of
 
06:31:08.468 --> 06:31:08.478 align:start position:0%
discussion lately about you know evs
 
06:31:11.030 --> 06:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
and rightfully so that you know adding
 
06:31:11.040 --> 06:31:12.230 align:start position:0%
and rightfully so that you know adding
evs

06:31:12.230 --> 06:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
evs
 
06:31:14.548 --> 06:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
to you know incentives to
 
06:31:16.468 --> 06:31:16.478 align:start position:0%
either have evs charging at night we'll
 
06:31:18.788 --> 06:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
add more kilowatt hours right to the
 
06:31:20.310 --> 06:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
distribution system and they'll be
 
06:31:22.230 --> 06:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of kilowatt hours
 
06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
that are charged through the
 
06:31:25.590 --> 06:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
distribution system we all know that
 
06:31:27.190 --> 06:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
transmission distribution of you know
 
06:31:29.510 --> 06:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're fixed assets that are recovered
 
06:31:29.520 --> 06:31:30.948 align:start position:0%
they're fixed assets that are recovered
volumetrically

06:31:30.948 --> 06:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
volumetrically
 
06:31:30.958 --> 06:31:32.230 align:start position:0%
volumetrically
so

06:31:32.230 --> 06:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:33.990 --> 06:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
i've heard people say you know hey more
 
06:31:36.628 --> 06:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
evs and that will allow for you know
 
06:31:38.548 --> 06:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
lower per kilowatt hour distribution
 
06:31:40.230 --> 06:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
cost because you're putting more
 
06:31:42.548 --> 06:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours onto the system
 
06:31:44.230 --> 06:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
to and then you're recovering those
 
06:31:46.310 --> 06:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
costs through more kilowatt hours which
 
06:31:49.190 --> 06:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
will lower the per kilowatt hour cost
 
06:31:51.030 --> 06:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
i know i'm speaking in circles here but
 
06:31:52.390 --> 06:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
just hear me out
 
06:31:54.310 --> 06:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
this build would do the opposite of that
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
it would actually you know
 
06:31:58.468 --> 06:31:58.478 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of
 
06:32:00.548 --> 06:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours that are charged to you
 
06:32:02.788 --> 06:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
know commercial entities which would
 
06:32:04.948 --> 06:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
force those costs on to other consumers
 
06:32:06.548 --> 06:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
on a per kilowatt-hour basis that's
 
06:32:08.708 --> 06:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
where the cost shift resides
 
06:32:10.788 --> 06:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
um i hope i explain that
 
06:32:13.990 --> 06:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:15.510 --> 06:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things we've
 
06:32:17.510 --> 06:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
passed community choice aggregation in
 
06:32:19.750 --> 06:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
the state that should drive that should
 
06:32:22.390 --> 06:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
incentivize investment in solar
 
06:32:24.230 --> 06:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
um i believe the gentleman from revision
 
06:32:26.468 --> 06:32:26.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know the high default
 
06:32:28.468 --> 06:32:28.478 align:start position:0%
energy service rates right now well that
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
in itself should incentivize
 
06:32:33.510 --> 06:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
um you know commercial industrial
 
06:32:36.310 --> 06:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
customers residential customers to
 
06:32:38.150 --> 06:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
to develop behind the meter storage
 
06:32:39.910 --> 06:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
solar on their own and to self-consume
 
06:32:42.150 --> 06:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
if that is what's driving this
 
06:32:42.160 --> 06:32:43.110 align:start position:0%
if that is what's driving this
um

06:32:43.110 --> 06:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:43.120 --> 06:32:44.948 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:32:44.948 --> 06:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:32:48.868 --> 06:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
the 100 to 500 kw change would actually
 
06:32:51.110 --> 06:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
increase the compensation to those
 
06:32:53.190 --> 06:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
facilities by another 5 cents a kilowatt
 
06:32:54.310 --> 06:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
hour because you're talking about
 
06:32:54.320 --> 06:32:55.510 align:start position:0%
hour because you're talking about
another

06:32:55.510 --> 06:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:32:57.670 --> 06:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
full transmission credit and 25 percent
 
06:32:59.670 --> 06:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
of distribution credit so it's very
 
06:33:01.510 --> 06:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
likely that would further increase the
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
cost shifting and again the last thing
 
06:33:05.190 --> 06:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
let's get to the study
 
06:33:07.110 --> 06:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
let's see what the study says it's not
 
06:33:08.628 --> 06:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
going to be definitive no one in this
 
06:33:10.310 --> 06:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
room is going to fully agree with
 
06:33:11.670 --> 06:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
everything that that study is going to
 
06:33:13.510 --> 06:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
say but at least will provide us with
 
06:33:15.270 --> 06:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
more information
 
06:33:17.910 --> 06:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
to to go on
 
06:33:20.150 --> 06:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
great two minutes and 56 seconds well
 
06:33:20.160 --> 06:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
great two minutes and 56 seconds well
done

06:33:22.070 --> 06:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:33:24.468 --> 06:33:24.478 align:start position:0%
so i have a question for you
 
06:33:29.030 --> 06:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
given the governor's veto of three
 
06:33:31.670 --> 06:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
expansion of net metering bills over the
 
06:33:34.628 --> 06:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
course of the last three years
 
06:33:37.110 --> 06:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
what would be your expectation if this
 
06:33:38.948 --> 06:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
bill should pass
 
06:33:40.868 --> 06:33:40.878 align:start position:0%
he's vetoed similar bills so i assume he
 
06:33:42.868 --> 06:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
would veto this one
 
06:33:48.150 --> 06:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:49.270 --> 06:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:33:51.510 --> 06:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
we thank you for your testimony
 
06:33:56.468 --> 06:33:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:59.350 --> 06:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
and mr campbell you have two minutes
 
06:34:01.830 --> 06:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um packy campbell again and i
 
06:34:02.948 --> 06:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
should state i'm here representing
 
06:34:04.468 --> 06:34:04.478 align:start position:0%
myself but i do own a solar company
 
06:34:05.990 --> 06:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
called bright spot solar that builds the
 
06:34:06.000 --> 06:34:07.270 align:start position:0%
called bright spot solar that builds the
trackers

06:34:07.270 --> 06:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
trackers
 
06:34:09.910 --> 06:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
i do have very succinct things related
 
06:34:12.468 --> 06:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
to this bill i both support and oppose
 
06:34:12.478 --> 06:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
to this bill i both support and oppose
it

06:34:13.750 --> 06:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:34:16.468 --> 06:34:16.478 align:start position:0%
i would ask this committee to do a
 
06:34:18.070 --> 06:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i think that we've seen a
 
06:34:20.150 --> 06:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony here today that this
 
06:34:22.708 --> 06:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
deserves further conversation
 
06:34:25.750 --> 06:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
before you have a floor fight before you
 
06:34:27.750 --> 06:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
vote on an amendment that's not quite i
 
06:34:29.030 --> 06:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
agree with representative harrington
 
06:34:31.590 --> 06:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
that that six and seven is confusing but
 
06:34:33.350 --> 06:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
i think six and seven is the heart of
 
06:34:35.190 --> 06:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
this whole bill if you consume
 
06:34:36.708 --> 06:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
electricity you ought to be able to have
 
06:34:38.230 --> 06:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
a system size that matches your
 
06:34:40.868 --> 06:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
consumption i've had two systems i own
 
06:34:43.590 --> 06:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
staples plaza i was limited to do 100
 
06:34:46.310 --> 06:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
kilowatts i then went to add 62
 
06:34:48.150 --> 06:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
kilowatts and then found out that i was
 
06:34:50.628 --> 06:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
losing my net metering and it actually
 
06:34:53.430 --> 06:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
cost me to add that extra 62 kilowatts i
 
06:34:55.110 --> 06:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that's right i should be
 
06:34:56.628 --> 06:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
able to offset my power and every
 
06:34:58.150 --> 06:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
business owner should
 
06:34:59.830 --> 06:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative lewinsky to answer your
 
06:35:02.230 --> 06:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
question no we cannot track the
 
06:35:03.830 --> 06:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
consumption behind the meter no one
 
06:35:05.430 --> 06:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
knows what i'm using behind the meter
 
06:35:06.948 --> 06:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
that's in general not a good thing to
 
06:35:08.468 --> 06:35:08.478 align:start position:0%
have in law something that you can't
 
06:35:11.350 --> 06:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
track you don't know and i oppose these
 
06:35:13.270 --> 06:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
behind the meter consumption sort of
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
rules that is not in statute now it is
 
06:35:18.310 --> 06:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
that 20 is in rules and i think that
 
06:35:21.510 --> 06:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
rule was created from a may to a shall
 
06:35:23.190 --> 06:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
the statute says you may participate in
 
06:35:25.270 --> 06:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
group net metering the statute says you
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
shall participate if you don't consume
 
06:35:26.718 --> 06:35:27.510 align:start position:0%
shall participate if you don't consume
20

06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
20
 
06:35:29.510 --> 06:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's blatantly illegal on the face i
 
06:35:31.830 --> 06:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to sue puc or anything but
 
06:35:33.190 --> 06:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's an issue that a subcommittee
 
06:35:34.708 --> 06:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
really should take up
 
06:35:37.830 --> 06:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
um the 500 kilowatts would be worthy for
 
06:35:39.750 --> 06:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
my interconnection experience i had one
 
06:35:41.830 --> 06:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
interconnection system 500 kva
 
06:35:44.868 --> 06:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
transformer 19 000. half a mile down the
 
06:35:48.230 --> 06:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
road 500 kva transformer 7 600
 
06:35:50.070 --> 06:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
there's wicked inconsistency and
 
06:35:51.750 --> 06:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
interconnection fees that's a very
 
06:35:53.510 --> 06:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
important part of this bill as someone
 
06:35:55.510 --> 06:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
who's trying to become a group host at
 
06:35:57.270 --> 06:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
the one megawatt level
 
06:35:59.190 --> 06:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
to to go to communities that have the
 
06:36:00.788 --> 06:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
consumption and find out that they have
 
06:36:02.868 --> 06:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
a small 10 kilowatt system and they
 
06:36:05.110 --> 06:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
can't be part of our group host is wrong
 
06:36:06.868 --> 06:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
they should be able to
 
06:36:09.270 --> 06:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
do those i really support what bob
 
06:36:11.110 --> 06:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
hayden from standard power said that's a
 
06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
simple cleanup that should be done the
 
06:36:14.948 --> 06:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
interconnection should be done and i
 
06:36:17.110 --> 06:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
think if you look at that first line six
 
06:36:18.468 --> 06:36:18.478 align:start position:0%
and seven you can accomplish everything
 
06:36:19.990 --> 06:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
else in the bill i hope that you'll have
 
06:36:23.350 --> 06:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee thank you okay thank you
 
06:36:24.788 --> 06:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
if there was one part of this bill
 
06:36:28.948 --> 06:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
that you thought was more important than
 
06:36:31.510 --> 06:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
any other part what would that be
 
06:36:33.030 --> 06:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
the interconnection piece that you just
 
06:36:33.040 --> 06:36:36.628 align:start position:0%
the interconnection piece that you just
discussed

06:36:36.628 --> 06:36:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:39.590 --> 06:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
i would say interconnection piece
 
06:36:41.910 --> 06:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
would be second i think first would be
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
that 100 kilowatt limit because most of
 
06:36:46.390 --> 06:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
my customers need more than 100
 
06:36:46.400 --> 06:36:47.670 align:start position:0%
my customers need more than 100
kilowatts

06:36:47.670 --> 06:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
kilowatts
 
06:36:49.830 --> 06:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
and those customers should be able to
 
06:36:51.670 --> 06:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
get net metering so that if they have
 
06:36:54.310 --> 06:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
150 kilowatt system or a 200 kilowatt
 
06:36:56.628 --> 06:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
system they only need that size because
 
06:36:58.628 --> 06:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
they have the consumption and in order
 
06:37:00.788 --> 06:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
to offset demand charges you need to
 
06:37:02.788 --> 06:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
oversize your consumption
 
06:37:04.708 --> 06:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
so if you did if you said your system
 
06:37:07.750 --> 06:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
could be 125 percent kilowatts ac
 
06:37:09.110 --> 06:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
inverter because that's what we use
 
06:37:11.270 --> 06:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's what you should use kilowatt ac
 
06:37:13.350 --> 06:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
inverter should be able to be sized at
 
06:37:16.230 --> 06:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
125 of your consumption and if you did
 
06:37:17.750 --> 06:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
that in section one if you're using a
 
06:37:20.548 --> 06:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
megawatt or using 300 000 or using 500
 
06:37:23.590 --> 06:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
000 you could then size your system so
 
06:37:26.070 --> 06:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
your ac inverter would be 25 bigger than
 
06:37:28.548 --> 06:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
that consumption that would be clean and
 
06:37:29.590 --> 06:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
that would probably be the most
 
06:37:31.750 --> 06:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
important part and that would be true
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
net metering and it would truly depend
 
06:37:35.190 --> 06:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
on consumption
 
06:37:37.110 --> 06:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
and yes if someone's power went down
 
06:37:39.350 --> 06:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
later so be it but at least you'd have a
 
06:37:41.750 --> 06:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
definitive way to size a system
 
06:37:43.270 --> 06:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
on day one to ask for your
 
06:37:44.868 --> 06:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
interconnection ask for your net
 
06:37:47.270 --> 06:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
metering i think politically speaking
 
06:37:48.628 --> 06:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
again in subcommittee i could speak to
 
06:37:50.468 --> 06:37:50.478 align:start position:0%
this as a rep let's do something the
 
06:37:52.868 --> 06:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
governor can sign folks let's have a
 
06:37:55.030 --> 06:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and let's say he can sign
 
06:37:57.750 --> 06:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
125 percent ac of your annual
 
06:37:59.670 --> 06:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
consumption because that's fair supports
 
06:38:01.510 --> 06:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire businesses that'd be a
 
06:38:03.590 --> 06:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
much better way to move the pendulum a
 
06:38:05.670 --> 06:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
little bit without changing net metering
 
06:38:07.910 --> 06:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
i support the one megawatt limit even as
 
06:38:10.070 --> 06:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
a solar guy i support it because i don't
 
06:38:12.390 --> 06:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
want outside capital coming into new
 
06:38:15.350 --> 06:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire doing big solar brown fields
 
06:38:17.510 --> 06:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
consuming this i don't support an
 
06:38:19.670 --> 06:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
increase to the one megawatt limit but i
 
06:38:22.548 --> 06:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
do support an increase to 125 percent of
 
06:38:23.990 --> 06:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
your consumption
 
06:38:25.670 --> 06:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
06:38:28.070 --> 06:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
pitts has a question quick question
 
06:38:29.830 --> 06:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
when you get your uh
 
06:38:31.830 --> 06:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
net metering credits
 
06:38:35.430 --> 06:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking directly to you
 
06:38:38.390 --> 06:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
does some of that energy sale go outside
 
06:38:38.400 --> 06:38:39.350 align:start position:0%
does some of that energy sale go outside
of

06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:38:40.788 --> 06:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:38:40.798 --> 06:38:42.070 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
no

06:38:42.070 --> 06:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:38:45.190 --> 06:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
that that it you like literally my house
 
06:38:47.190 --> 06:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
i made 43 000 kilowatts i have two
 
06:38:49.350 --> 06:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
trackers it went as far to my two
 
06:38:51.030 --> 06:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors down the street because they
 
06:38:52.948 --> 06:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
consumed that power
 
06:38:54.468 --> 06:38:54.478 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't go anywhere other than to
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
my neighbor literally or the closest
 
06:38:57.750 --> 06:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
industrial use
 
06:38:59.910 --> 06:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
the grid works on nodes those nodes are
 
06:38:59.920 --> 06:39:01.030 align:start position:0%
the grid works on nodes those nodes are
balanced

06:39:01.030 --> 06:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
balanced
 
06:39:03.190 --> 06:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
that power is being consumed in new
 
06:39:04.708 --> 06:39:04.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's why distributed energy
 
06:39:06.708 --> 06:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
is so important not solar distributed
 
06:39:08.948 --> 06:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
energy and that's what this is
 
06:39:11.190 --> 06:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr campbell and the very
 
06:39:13.350 --> 06:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
last speaker on this bill is
 
06:39:17.270 --> 06:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative tim lang
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:25.670 --> 06:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
just like yeah get 30 seconds great
 
06:39:27.430 --> 06:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members uh thank you
 
06:39:29.190 --> 06:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
for taking i'm a co-sponsor on this bail
 
06:39:30.548 --> 06:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
i'm representative tim lang i'm the
 
06:39:32.548 --> 06:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
chair of the hampshire the fish and game
 
06:39:34.150 --> 06:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee and i serve on ways and means
 
06:39:35.270 --> 06:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
as well
 
06:39:35.280 --> 06:39:36.070 align:start position:0%
as well
um

06:39:36.070 --> 06:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:37.990 --> 06:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
this bill that's before you it's it's a
 
06:39:39.590 --> 06:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
tough bill but the one thing i'm just
 
06:39:40.708 --> 06:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
going to ask i'm not going to get into
 
06:39:42.310 --> 06:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
technical details you talked about i
 
06:39:44.310 --> 06:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
agree with the last speaker 125 percent
 
06:39:45.830 --> 06:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
of consumption is probably the most key
 
06:39:47.270 --> 06:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
number that we're really talking about
 
06:39:49.030 --> 06:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
here regardless of the size of the solar
 
06:39:51.190 --> 06:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
array um i agree with the other speaker
 
06:39:53.350 --> 06:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
that spoke about the gap the fact that
 
06:39:54.868 --> 06:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
if you over one megawatt and you're
 
06:39:56.230 --> 06:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
producing more than your needs and it
 
06:39:58.150 --> 06:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
gets stumped out onto the internet down
 
06:40:00.788 --> 06:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
onto the net uh the grid what happens to
 
06:40:02.548 --> 06:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
it how would he get paid for it what do
 
06:40:04.708 --> 06:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
you do if you're above a one megawatt uh
 
06:40:06.468 --> 06:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
array um
 
06:40:08.468 --> 06:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
lakes region has a lot of manufacturers
 
06:40:09.990 --> 06:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
that would benefit by being able to
 
06:40:11.910 --> 06:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
offset some of their electrical costs
 
06:40:13.750 --> 06:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i guess to the committee what i'd
 
06:40:15.750 --> 06:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
say is that sometimes no is a complete
 
06:40:16.948 --> 06:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
sentence you don't need to say anything
 
06:40:18.628 --> 06:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
else it's just no
 
06:40:21.030 --> 06:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's crappy governance and you
 
06:40:22.070 --> 06:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
need to
 
06:40:23.910 --> 06:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
find the middle ground in between that's
 
06:40:25.110 --> 06:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to serve our new hampshire
 
06:40:27.030 --> 06:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
citizens and our manufacturers and our
 
06:40:28.868 --> 06:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
businesses here in the state
 
06:40:30.868 --> 06:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
i think we know that energy independence
 
06:40:32.230 --> 06:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
if we've learned anything by the oil
 
06:40:34.310 --> 06:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
prices then energy independence is
 
06:40:37.750 --> 06:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
extremely important to to consumers and
 
06:40:39.750 --> 06:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
a bill like this puts energy
 
06:40:41.350 --> 06:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
independence into the hands of the
 
06:40:43.270 --> 06:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
consumer and allows them to manage this
 
06:40:44.708 --> 06:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
a little bit better
 
06:40:46.390 --> 06:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
it creates the diversified electrical
 
06:40:47.990 --> 06:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
grid that i think is also important to
 
06:40:49.990 --> 06:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and to to what's going on
 
06:40:51.830 --> 06:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
so while i won't get into the technical
 
06:40:54.310 --> 06:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
merits i'd just tell you to before you
 
06:40:55.670 --> 06:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
say no
 
06:40:57.670 --> 06:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
remember no some while it is a complete
 
06:40:59.190 --> 06:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
sentence and sometimes appropriate
 
06:41:02.230 --> 06:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes it needs definition um around
 
06:41:04.310 --> 06:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
it um our consumers in new hampshire are
 
06:41:06.310 --> 06:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
dying for some sort of way to take
 
06:41:08.788 --> 06:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
control of their electrical consumption
 
06:41:10.708 --> 06:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
and i'd ask you to consider especially
 
06:41:12.948 --> 06:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
that 125 percent component how important
 
06:41:14.788 --> 06:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
that is to manufacturers and large
 
06:41:16.390 --> 06:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
businesses here in new hampshire able to
 
06:41:18.070 --> 06:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
take control of their
 
06:41:21.750 --> 06:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:23.510 --> 06:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're starting to repeat yourself so
 
06:41:25.350 --> 06:41:25.360 align:start position:0%

bill 264 relative to certain references
 
06:42:17.590 --> 06:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy
 
06:42:19.190 --> 06:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
and transferring authority over the
 
06:42:21.270 --> 06:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
low-income electric electricity
 
06:42:23.590 --> 06:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
assistance program to the department of
 
06:42:23.600 --> 06:42:24.708 align:start position:0%
assistance program to the department of
energy

06:42:24.708 --> 06:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:42:27.030 --> 06:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i would like to call on senator
 
06:42:29.990 --> 06:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
david waters to introduce this bill
 
06:42:31.830 --> 06:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you senator welcome aboard
 
06:42:33.750 --> 06:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh members of the committee
 
06:42:35.990 --> 06:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
and uh good to see you all again it's
 
06:42:38.628 --> 06:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
been a long day for all of us i know i
 
06:42:40.230 --> 06:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
am senator david waters district four
 
06:42:42.390 --> 06:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
here to introduce senate bill
 
06:42:44.788 --> 06:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
264 relative to
 
06:42:44.798 --> 06:42:45.670 align:start position:0%
264 relative to
the

06:42:45.670 --> 06:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:42:48.548 --> 06:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
low-income electricity assistance
 
06:42:48.558 --> 06:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
low-income electricity assistance
program

06:42:49.750 --> 06:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:42:52.868 --> 06:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill does it takes our
 
06:42:54.788 --> 06:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
highly successful
 
06:42:56.070 --> 06:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
low-income programs which were
 
06:42:58.788 --> 06:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
established in 1996 under
 
06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh restructuring
 
06:43:03.830 --> 06:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it puts it into statutes so we can
 
06:43:06.468 --> 06:43:06.478 align:start position:0%
stabilize its presence
 
06:43:08.230 --> 06:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
06:43:10.948 --> 06:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
this is appropriate to do because we
 
06:43:13.030 --> 06:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
have separated the puc from the
 
06:43:16.230 --> 06:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy and administration
 
06:43:18.230 --> 06:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
this program really does belong over a
 
06:43:20.548 --> 06:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
06:43:22.390 --> 06:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
i will say just by way of preface as
 
06:43:22.400 --> 06:43:23.190 align:start position:0%
i will say just by way of preface as
well

06:43:23.190 --> 06:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:43:25.110 --> 06:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
um that this
 
06:43:27.270 --> 06:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
version of the bill was worked out with
 
06:43:28.708 --> 06:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
06:43:32.230 --> 06:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh crease and david shulock
 
06:43:34.150 --> 06:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
and also input from raymond burke of
 
06:43:36.548 --> 06:43:36.558 align:start position:0%
nhla and it was fully vetted by the
 
06:43:38.868 --> 06:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh with its with
 
06:43:42.070 --> 06:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
its uh approval of the way that we put
 
06:43:43.670 --> 06:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
it together
 
06:43:45.910 --> 06:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
so what is what does it do it takes the
 
06:43:48.548 --> 06:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
existing uh program the definition of it
 
06:43:50.708 --> 06:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
of in the size of it and puts it in the
 
06:43:50.718 --> 06:43:51.750 align:start position:0%
of in the size of it and puts it in the
statute

06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:43:53.270 --> 06:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
please note that there is no change
 
06:43:55.270 --> 06:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to the funding
 
06:43:55.280 --> 06:43:56.628 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to the funding
mechanism

06:43:56.628 --> 06:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
06:43:56.638 --> 06:43:57.510 align:start position:0%
mechanism
that

06:43:57.510 --> 06:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:44:00.150 --> 06:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
if we get over a million in the program
 
06:44:02.150 --> 06:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
then that
 
06:44:02.160 --> 06:44:03.910 align:start position:0%
then that
that

06:44:03.910 --> 06:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:44:07.990 --> 06:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
surplus is by adjudicative process
 
06:44:08.000 --> 06:44:08.830 align:start position:0%
surplus is by adjudicative process
will

06:44:08.830 --> 06:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:44:11.270 --> 06:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
be returned
 
06:44:13.910 --> 06:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
as appropriate
 
06:44:14.868 --> 06:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
also please note that in the
 
06:44:19.270 --> 06:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
administration of it on line 15 we
 
06:44:20.948 --> 06:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure
 
06:44:20.958 --> 06:44:21.910 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure
that

06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
what it has
 
06:44:25.430 --> 06:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
it can do by a non-adjudicative hearing
 
06:44:27.590 --> 06:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
process which is something doe wanted
 
06:44:29.110 --> 06:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
very much to
 
06:44:30.628 --> 06:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
streamline this
 
06:44:30.638 --> 06:44:31.670 align:start position:0%
streamline this
process

06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:44:33.430 --> 06:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
that it would have control over approval
 
06:44:35.510 --> 06:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the budgets for how the money spent
 
06:44:36.788 --> 06:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
and then if the program is going to be
 
06:44:39.830 --> 06:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
modified if it's going to be modified
 
06:44:41.750 --> 06:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
then they also have that
 
06:44:41.760 --> 06:44:43.350 align:start position:0%
then they also have that
possibility

06:44:43.350 --> 06:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
06:44:45.190 --> 06:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
through adjudicative
 
06:44:45.200 --> 06:44:47.190 align:start position:0%
through adjudicative
process

06:44:47.190 --> 06:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:44:48.310 --> 06:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:44:51.030 --> 06:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know why do it i think two reasons
 
06:44:53.110 --> 06:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
really one i've mentioned is that uh we
 
06:44:55.510 --> 06:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
have separated the doe from the
 
06:44:57.990 --> 06:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
poc and then i i think also mr chairman
 
06:44:59.910 --> 06:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
particularly have thought seen that it
 
06:45:01.590 --> 06:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
is probably a good idea to have things
 
06:45:03.510 --> 06:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
in statute and so that's why you have
 
06:45:05.990 --> 06:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
this before you today so thank you and
 
06:45:08.708 --> 06:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to take any questions
 
06:45:10.310 --> 06:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you senator seems like a
 
06:45:12.230 --> 06:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
relatively simple bill
 
06:45:14.230 --> 06:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh we appreciate you bringing it here to
 
06:45:16.628 --> 06:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
us representative mcgee has a question
 
06:45:18.468 --> 06:45:18.478 align:start position:0%
for you thank you mr chairman and thank
 
06:45:20.390 --> 06:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question
 
06:45:23.110 --> 06:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
um it looks like on page
 
06:45:24.548 --> 06:45:24.558 align:start position:0%
i don't know what page it is it doesn't
 
06:45:26.070 --> 06:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
have a number on it
 
06:45:28.230 --> 06:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
page one i think of of the
 
06:45:28.240 --> 06:45:29.270 align:start position:0%
page one i think of of the
bill

06:45:29.270 --> 06:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:45:29.280 --> 06:45:30.070 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

06:45:30.070 --> 06:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:45:30.080 --> 06:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
uh
line

06:45:33.270 --> 06:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:35.350 --> 06:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
19. if the department of energy
 
06:45:36.468 --> 06:45:36.478 align:start position:0%
determines that the low income
 
06:45:38.070 --> 06:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
assistance program fund has accumulated
 
06:45:39.910 --> 06:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
in excess of a million dollars and that
 
06:45:41.830 --> 06:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
excess is not likely to be substantially
 
06:45:43.510 --> 06:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
reduced over the next 12 months the
 
06:45:45.190 --> 06:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy may
 
06:45:47.670 --> 06:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
using a non-adjudicative hearing process
 
06:45:50.070 --> 06:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
suspend by order the collection of some
 
06:45:51.750 --> 06:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
or all of the portion of the system
 
06:45:53.590 --> 06:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
benefits charge for the period of time
 
06:45:57.590 --> 06:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
it deems reasonable to reduce program
 
06:45:57.600 --> 06:45:58.788 align:start position:0%
it deems reasonable to reduce program
fund

06:45:58.788 --> 06:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
fund
 
06:46:00.468 --> 06:46:00.478 align:start position:0%
funds i guess it should be to the level
 
06:46:01.990 --> 06:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to achieve the program's
 
06:46:04.310 --> 06:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
purposes so could you say anyth could
 
06:46:06.390 --> 06:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
you say something about
 
06:46:06.400 --> 06:46:07.270 align:start position:0%
you say something about
um

06:46:07.270 --> 06:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:08.948 --> 06:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
how that came about or why that's in
 
06:46:10.628 --> 06:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
there although i i think it's probably a
 
06:46:12.230 --> 06:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
good provision but i just would like to
 
06:46:13.830 --> 06:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
know a little more about that i i will
 
06:46:16.230 --> 06:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
but i i think i'll actually let mr
 
06:46:17.590 --> 06:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
crease address i think that's what we do
 
06:46:17.600 --> 06:46:18.390 align:start position:0%
crease address i think that's what we do
now

06:46:18.390 --> 06:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:46:19.990 --> 06:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's just the process we now
 
06:46:21.750 --> 06:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
we you know with the million dollars of
 
06:46:24.468 --> 06:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
what we've we agreed on uh from the
 
06:46:26.230 --> 06:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
assistant benefit charge for this and
 
06:46:28.150 --> 06:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's important to keep that that
 
06:46:29.590 --> 06:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
agreement in place and this is a
 
06:46:31.750 --> 06:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do it so you're maintaining
 
06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
as you said you're putting it into
 
06:46:33.120 --> 06:46:34.230 align:start position:0%
as you said you're putting it into
statute

06:46:34.230 --> 06:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
what you already do okay thank you thank
 
06:46:36.240 --> 06:46:37.190 align:start position:0%
what you already do okay thank you thank
you

06:46:37.190 --> 06:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:46:39.270 --> 06:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
and industrial representative platt is
 
06:46:41.590 --> 06:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
recognized yes just for my minutes this
 
06:46:43.270 --> 06:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
does nothing but transfer the
 
06:46:45.750 --> 06:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility from puc to doe
 
06:46:47.430 --> 06:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
the department of energy makes no other
 
06:46:49.910 --> 06:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
changes is that correct uh well thank
 
06:46:52.548 --> 06:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
you it makes a couple of in in terms of
 
06:46:54.548 --> 06:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
the adjudicative process and defining
 
06:46:54.558 --> 06:46:55.350 align:start position:0%
the adjudicative process and defining
that

06:46:55.350 --> 06:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:46:57.190 --> 06:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh that i suppose you could cause
 
06:46:59.430 --> 06:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
changes that were necessitated
 
06:47:01.110 --> 06:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
by putting the administrative function
 
06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:08.390 --> 06:47:08.400 align:start position:0%

06:47:26.230 --> 06:47:26.240 align:start position:0%

concerns that doe had highlighted in the
 
06:47:45.840 --> 06:47:47.510 align:start position:0%
concerns that doe had highlighted in the
language

06:47:47.510 --> 06:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
and those
 
06:47:51.190 --> 06:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
technical concerns were addressed
 
06:47:53.190 --> 06:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
in the senate and
 
06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
is in the bill before you today
 
06:47:57.590 --> 06:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate the bill
 
06:48:00.150 --> 06:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
codifies the electric assistance program
 
06:48:02.230 --> 06:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
or eap
 
06:48:04.150 --> 06:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
in state statute and moves the
 
06:48:06.310 --> 06:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
programmatic aspects of it from the puc
 
06:48:07.830 --> 06:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
06:48:10.548 --> 06:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
just for background purposes the eap
 
06:48:13.430 --> 06:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
began in 2002 as part of electric
 
06:48:15.590 --> 06:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
restructuring and it's designed to make
 
06:48:17.830 --> 06:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
bills more affordable for low-income
 
06:48:19.670 --> 06:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
households and potentially avoid having
 
06:48:20.948 --> 06:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
their electricity shut off for
 
06:48:20.958 --> 06:48:22.788 align:start position:0%
their electricity shut off for
non-payment

06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
non-payment
 
06:48:25.590 --> 06:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
the eap provides eligible customers with
 
06:48:27.430 --> 06:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
a discount on their monthly electric
 
06:48:29.190 --> 06:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
bills ranging anywhere from eight
 
06:48:29.200 --> 06:48:30.150 align:start position:0%
bills ranging anywhere from eight
percent

06:48:30.150 --> 06:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:48:32.150 --> 06:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
to 76 percent depending on the
 
06:48:33.750 --> 06:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
customer's gross
 
06:48:36.070 --> 06:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
household income and their household
 
06:48:36.080 --> 06:48:37.430 align:start position:0%
household income and their household
size

06:48:37.430 --> 06:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
size
 
06:48:39.670 --> 06:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
eligible individuals and households can
 
06:48:41.670 --> 06:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
apply to the eap through their local
 
06:48:43.750 --> 06:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
community action programs you might know
 
06:48:45.590 --> 06:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
them as caps
 
06:48:47.590 --> 06:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
taps take applications qualified
 
06:48:49.990 --> 06:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
customers utilities cover that customer
 
06:48:50.000 --> 06:48:51.190 align:start position:0%
customers utilities cover that customer
for

06:48:51.190 --> 06:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:48:53.190 --> 06:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
with an appropriate discount
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
for a 12-month period
 
06:48:57.830 --> 06:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
as is mentioned in is outlined in the
 
06:49:00.468 --> 06:49:00.478 align:start position:0%
bill the eap is funded by all electric
 
06:49:02.070 --> 06:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
utility customers through a portion of
 
06:49:03.750 --> 06:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
the system benefits charge on their
 
06:49:05.670 --> 06:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
06:49:08.230 --> 06:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
just running through the bill briefly
 
06:49:09.830 --> 06:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
section one
 
06:49:12.150 --> 06:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
replaces a reference
 
06:49:13.910 --> 06:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the commission with the department
 
06:49:15.670 --> 06:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
because it's shifting the eap over to
 
06:49:18.230 --> 06:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
the department from the commission
 
06:49:19.830 --> 06:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
section two just creates a new
 
06:49:19.840 --> 06:49:21.430 align:start position:0%
section two just creates a new
definition

06:49:21.430 --> 06:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
definition
 
06:49:23.110 --> 06:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
for the department in that statute to
 
06:49:25.590 --> 06:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
make explicit reference to us
 
06:49:27.270 --> 06:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then section three
 
06:49:28.868 --> 06:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
is the bulk of the bill where it moves
 
06:49:30.948 --> 06:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
the eap from the puc
 
06:49:32.390 --> 06:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
over to the department and clarifies
 
06:49:35.110 --> 06:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
administration of the program so
 
06:49:37.430 --> 06:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see in there it establishes the
 
06:49:39.030 --> 06:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
eap's funding to be from the system
 
06:49:41.270 --> 06:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
benefits charge at a rate of 1.5 mills
 
06:49:43.270 --> 06:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour
 
06:49:45.990 --> 06:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
all previous puc orders regarding the
 
06:49:47.670 --> 06:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
creation implementation of the program
 
06:49:50.070 --> 06:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
are transferred over to the department
 
06:49:51.510 --> 06:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
it carries over various things that
 
06:49:53.110 --> 06:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
currently exist there in statute so the
 
06:49:55.270 --> 06:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
language on lines
 
06:50:00.310 --> 06:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:03.030 --> 06:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
24 that's the million dollar excess that
 
06:50:04.708 --> 06:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
um exists for the commission now that
 
06:50:06.868 --> 06:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
carries over to the department um and
 
06:50:09.350 --> 06:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
then obviously on lines 25-26 any
 
06:50:12.468 --> 06:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
actions taken using a non-adjudicative
 
06:50:14.390 --> 06:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
hearing process shall be by written
 
06:50:16.070 --> 06:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
decision and the department shall say
 
06:50:18.788 --> 06:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
its reasons for the actions taken um
 
06:50:20.390 --> 06:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
that really concludes my testimony just
 
06:50:22.150 --> 06:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
want to give background on the eap and
 
06:50:25.510 --> 06:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:31.110 --> 06:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:31.120 --> 06:50:32.628 align:start position:0%
 
none

just that
 
06:51:30.468 --> 06:51:30.478 align:start position:0%
this bill has an impressive roster of
 
06:51:32.948 --> 06:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan co-sponsors
 
06:51:34.468 --> 06:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
i always feel a little more comfortable
 
06:51:36.150 --> 06:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
sitting at this table when i know i'm
 
06:51:37.590 --> 06:51:37.600 align:start position:0%

government a good government initiative
 
06:51:47.110 --> 06:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's really in the spirit of the house
 
06:51:48.868 --> 06:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
06:51:50.390 --> 06:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
language that created the department of
 
06:51:53.190 --> 06:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
energy it was hard back then last year
 
06:51:54.788 --> 06:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
to think of everything and i think this
 
06:51:56.948 --> 06:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
is one that didn't really get focused on
 
06:51:59.270 --> 06:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
that deserves to be the public utilities
 
06:52:01.750 --> 06:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
commission as it's been reconfigured is
 
06:52:04.788 --> 06:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
really good at adjudication and the
 
06:52:06.948 --> 06:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
department of energy exists
 
06:52:10.150 --> 06:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
to do program implementation the public
 
06:52:12.150 --> 06:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
utilities commission does its work
 
06:52:14.310 --> 06:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
behind an ex-parte wall that's pretty
 
06:52:16.628 --> 06:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
impermeable the department of energy is
 
06:52:19.030 --> 06:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
accessible when questions arise and when
 
06:52:22.310 --> 06:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
programmatic tweaks are needed so that's
 
06:52:25.230 --> 06:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
why i think it makes sense to transfer
 
06:52:27.910 --> 06:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the electric
 
06:52:30.628 --> 06:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
assistance program from the puc
 
06:52:33.270 --> 06:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
over to the department of energy the eap
 
06:52:34.628 --> 06:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
as you've already heard about it makes
 
06:52:36.548 --> 06:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
an interesting contrast with the energy
 
06:52:39.110 --> 06:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency program so this sort of book
 
06:52:41.750 --> 06:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
ends house bill 549 in a way those are
 
06:52:44.070 --> 06:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
the two major those are the two programs
 
06:52:46.310 --> 06:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
right now that are funded by the system
 
06:52:49.430 --> 06:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
benefits charge uh both are enshrined
 
06:52:50.548 --> 06:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
and always have been in the
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
restructuring act
 
06:52:54.548 --> 06:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
the electric assistance program has
 
06:52:58.070 --> 06:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
always been fixed by statute at 1.5
 
06:53:00.708 --> 06:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
mills per kilowatt hour that's that
 
06:53:03.350 --> 06:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
program's portion of the system benefits
 
06:53:05.350 --> 06:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
charge it's right there in the statute
 
06:53:07.030 --> 06:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
it isn't changing
 
06:53:09.350 --> 06:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
it has a much smaller revenue stream and
 
06:53:10.310 --> 06:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
much more
 
06:53:12.948 --> 06:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
limited administrative needs than the nh
 
06:53:17.430 --> 06:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
saves programs do uh prior to house bill
 
06:53:19.990 --> 06:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
2 the program has all the way back to
 
06:53:22.150 --> 06:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
its inception back in the early part of
 
06:53:24.548 --> 06:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
the century been governed essentially by
 
06:53:27.030 --> 06:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
an advisory board called the eap
 
06:53:28.788 --> 06:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
advisory board
 
06:53:30.868 --> 06:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
the puc back in the day was actually
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
represented on that board that paradigm
 
06:53:34.548 --> 06:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
worked so
 
06:53:37.030 --> 06:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh it it makes sense now for the
 
06:53:39.430 --> 06:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy to be the sort of
 
06:53:41.590 --> 06:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
parent organization to the advisory
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
board and i think this bill has that
 
06:53:45.510 --> 06:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
effect too
 
06:53:47.270 --> 06:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh as you've already heard from senator
 
06:53:49.350 --> 06:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
waters uh the bill was amended over in
 
06:53:50.628 --> 06:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
the senate thanks to excellent
 
06:53:50.638 --> 06:53:51.990 align:start position:0%
the senate thanks to excellent
collaboration

06:53:51.990 --> 06:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
06:53:53.990 --> 06:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
with and input from new hampshire legal
 
06:53:56.150 --> 06:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
assistance and the department of energy
 
06:53:58.628 --> 06:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh the refund provision that i think
 
06:54:01.350 --> 06:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee asked about is in
 
06:54:03.270 --> 06:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
the current version of the statute so
 
06:54:05.030 --> 06:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
the only thing about that
 
06:54:07.190 --> 06:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
that changes in other words that
 
06:54:09.590 --> 06:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism where if there's an excessive
 
06:54:12.708 --> 06:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
balance in the fund the low income
 
06:54:14.788 --> 06:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
portion of the sbc is reduced for a
 
06:54:16.788 --> 06:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
while that's in the statute right now so
 
06:54:17.990 --> 06:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
the only difference is that the
 
06:54:19.350 --> 06:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy would have to make
 
06:54:20.468 --> 06:54:20.478 align:start position:0%
that call
 
06:54:22.708 --> 06:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
i consider this a very uncontroversial
 
06:54:24.948 --> 06:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
initiative that ties up a loose thread
 
06:54:26.468 --> 06:54:26.478 align:start position:0%
from the legislation that created the
 
06:54:29.110 --> 06:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
department of energy so i respectfully
 
06:54:31.670 --> 06:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
but emphatically recommend that you
 
06:54:33.670 --> 06:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
report it to the floor with an ought to
 
06:54:35.670 --> 06:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation and of course i'd be
 
06:54:37.830 --> 06:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if that's
 
06:54:40.150 --> 06:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
the chairman's pleasure
 
06:54:42.150 --> 06:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your usual brilliant
 
06:54:45.750 --> 06:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on a bill before us
 
06:54:48.310 --> 06:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for our consumer
 
06:54:48.320 --> 06:54:50.150 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for our consumer
advocate

06:54:50.150 --> 06:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
06:54:52.868 --> 06:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
since this is as you point out a pretty
 
06:54:55.110 --> 06:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
non-controversial bill there's probably
 
06:54:58.070 --> 06:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
not a lot to ask
 
06:55:00.310 --> 06:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
so i thank you thank you it looks like
 
06:55:01.830 --> 06:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to
 
06:55:04.548 --> 06:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
call next upon mr raymond burke who
 
06:55:06.310 --> 06:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
represents the new hampshire legal
 
06:55:09.590 --> 06:55:09.600 align:start position:0%

can a
 
06:55:20.948 --> 06:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate crease is always a
 
06:55:22.230 --> 06:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
tough act to follow and i don't know
 
06:55:23.990 --> 06:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
that i'll have much more to say but just
 
06:55:26.070 --> 06:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
for the record raymond burke
 
06:55:27.510 --> 06:55:27.520 align:start position:0%

who may not be familiar with us is a
 
06:55:31.190 --> 06:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
non-profit law firm that represents
 
06:55:32.628 --> 06:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
low-income granite staters throughout
 
06:55:34.948 --> 06:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
the state in civil legal matters and we
 
06:55:37.110 --> 06:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
have an energy and utility justice
 
06:55:39.030 --> 06:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
project where we represent
 
06:55:39.040 --> 06:55:40.708 align:start position:0%
project where we represent
ratepayers

06:55:40.708 --> 06:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
06:55:43.030 --> 06:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
in matters related to access to
 
06:55:45.670 --> 06:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
affordable energy service including in
 
06:55:47.830 --> 06:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
dockets before the public utility
 
06:55:47.840 --> 06:55:49.430 align:start position:0%
dockets before the public utility
commission

06:55:49.430 --> 06:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:55:51.990 --> 06:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
as you heard uh from senator waters um
 
06:55:52.000 --> 06:55:53.110 align:start position:0%
as you heard uh from senator waters um
earlier

06:55:53.110 --> 06:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:55:54.628 --> 06:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
the electric assistance program is a
 
06:55:57.270 --> 06:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
crucial program uh in our state and and
 
06:55:59.030 --> 06:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
we've been involved in it uh since its
 
06:56:01.670 --> 06:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
inception uh many decades ago at this
 
06:56:03.990 --> 06:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
point um and it's been touted by the
 
06:56:06.468 --> 06:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
regulatory assistance project as a as a
 
06:56:08.708 --> 06:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
model program for the region uh and
 
06:56:12.390 --> 06:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps nationally so um we support um
 
06:56:14.948 --> 06:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh this bill we support enshrining it in
 
06:56:17.110 --> 06:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
statute for all the reasons you heard
 
06:56:20.390 --> 06:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
already from those who spoke
 
06:56:23.190 --> 06:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate
 
06:56:25.430 --> 06:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
the the collaboration with the
 
06:56:26.708 --> 06:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
department of energy the consumer
 
06:56:28.628 --> 06:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
advocate senator waters and his
 
06:56:30.310 --> 06:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues to
 
06:56:32.390 --> 06:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
work on the version that is before you
 
06:56:34.788 --> 06:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
now um the only other thing that i can
 
06:56:37.350 --> 06:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
say um from our perspective just to
 
06:56:39.270 --> 06:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the questions that were
 
06:56:42.070 --> 06:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
asked earlier uh to the extent
 
06:56:44.830 --> 06:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
anything is is changing i think
 
06:56:47.868 --> 06:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
um where you see references to the
 
06:56:49.910 --> 06:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
non-adjudicative hearing process and
 
06:56:51.990 --> 06:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
this speaks to one of our concerns when
 
06:56:53.510 --> 06:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
we were working on the bill over on on
 
06:56:55.910 --> 06:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
the senate side um that's just to
 
06:56:59.590 --> 06:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
clarify what the process is
 
06:57:01.190 --> 06:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
with the department of energy
 
06:57:03.350 --> 06:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
historically because the puc has
 
06:57:05.030 --> 06:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
overseen the program
 
06:57:07.430 --> 06:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
the way the puc operated when changes
 
06:57:09.910 --> 06:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be made or the excess funds
 
06:57:11.510 --> 06:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed it would open an
 
06:57:13.990 --> 06:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicative docket and so i think that
 
06:57:16.150 --> 06:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
language is merely clarifying the
 
06:57:18.628 --> 06:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
process that the department of energy
 
06:57:20.548 --> 06:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
is suitable to do which would was as i
 
06:57:22.468 --> 06:57:22.478 align:start position:0%
read it would be a notice and comment
 
06:57:23.990 --> 06:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
period and we thought it was especially
 
06:57:24.000 --> 06:57:25.110 align:start position:0%
period and we thought it was especially
important

06:57:25.110 --> 06:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:57:26.948 --> 06:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
to to make that clear and then also to
 
06:57:29.350 --> 06:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
have the last two lines 24 and 25
 
06:57:31.350 --> 06:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
stating that the department will issue a
 
06:57:33.990 --> 06:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
written decision uh stating why it's
 
06:57:35.590 --> 06:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
making the its decision and how it's
 
06:57:38.390 --> 06:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
responding to any comments that might be
 
06:57:38.400 --> 06:57:39.990 align:start position:0%
responding to any comments that might be
received

06:57:39.990 --> 06:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
received
 
06:57:44.868 --> 06:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:46.390 --> 06:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
great representative blett has a
 
06:57:47.910 --> 06:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you thank you for
 
06:57:49.990 --> 06:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question because it's a
 
06:57:52.548 --> 06:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
non-adjudicative process at the ue the
 
06:57:53.830 --> 06:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
department of india they're coming up
 
06:57:55.830 --> 06:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
with a written statement somebody could
 
06:57:58.070 --> 06:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
appeal that to the puc and make it
 
06:57:58.080 --> 06:57:59.510 align:start position:0%
appeal that to the puc and make it
adjudicative

06:57:59.510 --> 06:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicative
 
06:58:02.070 --> 06:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
um i i uh
 
06:58:03.830 --> 06:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
maybe would ask maybe for someone else
 
06:58:06.310 --> 06:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
to clarify so i don't misstate but my my
 
06:58:08.070 --> 06:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
take on that is that
 
06:58:10.230 --> 06:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
an appeal would not go to the puc but
 
06:58:11.910 --> 06:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
there there might be an appeal that
 
06:58:15.110 --> 06:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
could be made uh in in uh court i can't
 
06:58:16.548 --> 06:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
recall the top of my head if it would go
 
06:58:17.670 --> 06:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
straight to the new hampshire supreme
 
06:58:19.190 --> 06:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
court or it would have to start in
 
06:58:21.670 --> 06:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
superior court but there may be legal
 
06:58:23.430 --> 06:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
remedies available in court but i don't
 
06:58:25.110 --> 06:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
think it would go to
 
06:58:26.788 --> 06:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh the puc would no longer have
 
06:58:28.948 --> 06:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the program but if
 
06:58:32.628 --> 06:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:34.548 --> 06:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
well that's a good clarification thank
 
06:58:34.558 --> 06:58:35.910 align:start position:0%
well that's a good clarification thank
you

06:58:35.910 --> 06:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions for new hampshire
 
06:58:41.430 --> 06:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
legal assistance
 
06:58:43.590 --> 06:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you very much thank
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
you for testifying on this bill
 
06:58:46.080 --> 06:58:47.350 align:start position:0%
you for testifying on this bill
uh

06:58:47.350 --> 06:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:58:49.350 --> 06:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
mr crease do you have anything to add to
 
06:58:51.670 --> 06:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
that last question about
 
06:58:51.680 --> 06:58:54.390 align:start position:0%
that last question about
appeals

06:58:54.390 --> 06:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:56.948 --> 06:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
only to say that i agree with mr burke
 
06:59:00.070 --> 06:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh that basically this bill transfers
 
06:59:03.110 --> 06:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility and authority for the eap
 
06:59:05.110 --> 06:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
over to the department of energy so that
 
06:59:07.830 --> 06:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
if a party were grieved by what the
 
06:59:09.430 --> 06:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
department did
 
06:59:12.150 --> 06:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh i think that you could
 
06:59:14.150 --> 06:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
at least ask the new hampshire supreme
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
court to hear an appeal
 
06:59:18.150 --> 06:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
of course it would be discretionary as
 
06:59:21.430 --> 06:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
are appeals from the puc itself
 
06:59:23.350 --> 06:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
would do you think that the department
 
06:59:26.150 --> 06:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
would entertain an appeal to a decision
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
well you would have to ask them to
 
06:59:29.510 --> 06:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
re-hear the idea
 
06:59:33.190 --> 06:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
the statute which is rsa 541 3
 
06:59:35.350 --> 06:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
says that before you can consider an
 
06:59:37.830 --> 06:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
appeal you have to ask the agency to
 
06:59:40.468 --> 06:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
correct its mistake that's just a way of
 
06:59:43.350 --> 06:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
creating some efficiency in government
 
06:59:45.590 --> 06:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you for that answer
 
06:59:46.788 --> 06:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
you're the first person to call me
 
06:59:49.990 --> 06:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:50.000 --> 06:59:51.190 align:start position:0%

subcommittee or a hearing on the
 
07:00:34.468 --> 07:00:34.478 align:start position:0%
difficult bill that we had uh prior to
