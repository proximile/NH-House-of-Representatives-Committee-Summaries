do it and save your voice thank you I'll
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
be very brief um the sponsor did not
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
show up for this bill and there are
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
times when we've had a bill when we have
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh held it over and waited for a sponsor
 
00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:39.559 align:start position:0%
to come in the sponsor to the best of my
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge is aware that this bill is not
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
going to pass
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
and the issue is the fact that the
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee is also against this
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
which some people may find problematic
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
but we have very carefully chosen Meers
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
members of the Ethics Committee the top
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
leadership in the House and Senate
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
appoint different members and the way
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
the committee is set up we have one
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
Democrat from the house and the Senate
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
one republican from the house and the
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
Senate and we have um excuse me the
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
three other public members are chosen by
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
the Senate President the house and
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
jointly together and we have a system
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
that works um I heard this morning that
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
there have been complaints against us
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee has never had a
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
complaint there are times we have in
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
terms of our processes there are times
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
we have to go into nonpublic sessions
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
and that's by law and that information
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
is not made public we then come out of
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
non-public sessions and we say what the
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
decision is and if anyone has any
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
concerns or anything they can speak up
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
that has not happened um I'm just saying
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's not broken we don't need to fix it
 
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.630 align:start position:0%
it's not broken we don't need to fix it
thank

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative wall uh
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
Reed by way before you speak um I want
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
to thank everyone who come came in and
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%

00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your help representative
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
Reed sorry for that no thank you Mr
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
chair um so I just conferred with the
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
Bill's Prime sponsor who was under the
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
understanding that she would receive
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
another hearing and was that it was not
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
going to be killed so that piece of
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
information um is not accurate according
 
00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:40.039 align:start position:0%
to her I will say that um I I do think
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee needs um reform
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
because there's been multiple situations
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
that um we neither have rules but also
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee hasn't acted on
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
like times many many times where members
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
have voted on issues where they are
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
personally uh financially
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
um tied to the issue and yet do not
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
recuse themselves other issues I won't
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
go into because I know that those are
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
confidential but um I don't I personally
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think this bill as written will
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
affect that but I would prefer to see
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
this interim studied um because I do
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
think in the long term we need to reform
 
00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:18.039 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee and the fact that
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee is Weighing on
 
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
regulating itself in and of itself is a
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
problem I
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
think thank you representative Reed uh
 
00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:30.149 align:start position:0%
think thank you representative Reed uh
further

00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
discussion so let me just um
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
clarify um something that was said
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
um uh the prime sponsor did not um did
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
not show up I think we had rep costol
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill right um I heard
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
from um the prime
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor the day we were the day before
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
we were going to execute last week week
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and and at that time we had a hallway
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
conversation and I suggested to her that
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
we would still be executing her bill
 
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
today I had moved it from that week to
 
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
today and that um if she were here I
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
would give her U five minutes before we
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
exacted it um there was there was no
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
promise given of another hearing it was
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh I would let her speak before before
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
we exec it
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see her here so
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
that's uh excuse representative Reed I
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification I didn't
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
mean to say that what she had said was
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
accurate only that I was uh countering
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
the idea that the prime sponsor was okay
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
with killing the bill because I just
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
talked to her and that was not her
 
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
understanding whether her understanding
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
was correct or not I don't know but I'm
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
just letting you know that that is not
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
the understanding of the Prime sponsor
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll pass her note in Jim um
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%

motion thank you Mr chair I'd like to

hr25 representative mcara moves interim
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
study seconded by representative
 
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
study seconded by representative
wall

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
wall
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%

to discuss your motion I would thank you
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um we've uh come upon some um
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
additional information recently that I
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
think uh Warren's further work on this
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
bill as opposed to um bringing it to the
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
house floor at this time so I'm
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
requesting some more time to work on
 
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.789 align:start position:0%
requesting some more time to work on
that

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh further
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
discussion representative wall thank you
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
I second that because it's a very
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
important issue uh we need to look into
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
it further we have not had the time to
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
do that I think in this committee when
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
we do interim study we really do interim
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
study thank
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative wall um
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to note out as far as
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
I think the is a great idea because it
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
will actually weed out uh the positiv
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
and negative of the of the HR that was
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
presented even though it wasn't supposed
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
to be an HR that's how it ended up the
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
other part is is we all know words
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
matter all right and we that's why I
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
think the study is going to help us out
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
because between rules rsas
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution we have some words in there
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
that are conflicting and I think that
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
study will actually clear that up
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sers uh further
 
00:33:30.039 --> 00:33:32.029 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sers uh further
conversation

00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll just make one comment um
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's clear that we have an ongoing legal
 
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
situation with the issues that erased in
 
00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
this um house
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
resolution uh it would seem logical to
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
me um and why I will vote Yes for the
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
interim study that um that that will
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
give us time for for um the findings
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Supreme Court um
 
00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
to be heard and um and as representative
 
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
wall said earlier we do uh in this
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
committee uh treat interim study as a
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
true interim study um so we would be
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
able to have the information from the
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um at that
 
00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:23.079 align:start position:0%
time uh further conversation
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative s Mr chair I was just
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if um it could be our
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee doing the study do you know
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
that for
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
sure if if if we if we interim study it
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%

it um further further
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%

the house
 
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.589 align:start position:0%
the house
[Music]

00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
resolution that's before us
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
is quite broad uh quite quite far reach
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
ing it involves a lot of topics that are
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
currently being debated in this body
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
through other pieces of
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
legislation uh one of the items
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
specifically of concern is on line 15
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
where it states the
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
enshrining of an economic Bill of Rights
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Constitution that
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
is this is certainly not the vessel to
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
do something like
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
that so I find the the the
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
complications the the
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
broad topics are are current tackling of
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
certain issues in that problematic line
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
to be more than justification for an itl
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson further
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair I mean I agree
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
with representative Pearson that it is
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
quite Broad and I'm not sure that this
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
is the correct vessel because if you're
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
going to enshrine Something in the
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution seems like it would be a
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
cacr so I I agree with all that however
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
when I read this I like all of these
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
things I think it's good it is Broad it
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
is Broad but they're all good things
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
that we should all have and so I would
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
prefer to see an interim study to talk
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
about and if it needs to be narrowed it
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
needs to be narrowed but you know things
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
like pollution-free water and safe
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
housing those things I think in an
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
Equitable justice system I think those
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
things are are good and we should
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
enshrine them in the Constitution so I
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
think it's worth discussing over uh an
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
interim study and um and coming up with
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps slightly narrower language so I
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
would support interim study thank you
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Reed represent cable
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um yeah I want to I
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too down into the we
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
on this but um one of the you know you
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
can't really disagree with most of these
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
but it really becomes on what is the
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
solution which is why you would really
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
need specific bills to Target specific
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
things because there's different we'll
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll agree on it but we'll have
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
different um Avenues to get there and I
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
think that's where the debate should
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
happen is on the actual Solutions but
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
getting right to the HR one of the
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
problems I had um I had worked on um C
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
few years ago on a lot of energy bills
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
and with the governor's office we on a
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
task force and put forward a bunch of
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
bills um and one of the the tenants in
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
this this was reliable and green um
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
energy um
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
and factually speaking those are
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
opposite you can the green energy right
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
now is unreliable um so while it sounds
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
good to say in practice it's it's it's
 
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
an impossibility because green energy
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
right now is inherently
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
unreliable um so while these
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
conversations need to be had it's not
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's not um necess neily the the place
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
to do it thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
rep Constable um further
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Reed thank you
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair I mean uh again I I
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
prefer interm study because I do agree
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
that this is a bit broad um I mean the
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative I can debate separately
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
as it's not in in in like immediately
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
gerain to debate how reliable green
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
energy is but I am the chair of my
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
energy and environment Committee in my
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
town and I'm the uh National caucus of
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
environmental legislators State lead so
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
I can I I'm happy to have that debate
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
privately but I I do agree we can narrow
 
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
this narrow this down but having a Bill
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
of Rights that is kind of like a
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
onot constitutional change is completely
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
within precedent first of all our
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
federal Bill of Rights we got 10 of them
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
in one shot in fact Madison had to
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
promise that Bill of Rights when he was
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
trying to sell the Constitution just to
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
get the con constitution ratified um New
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire took the lead on that and said
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to put our Bill of Rights
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
front and center in our in our
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
constitution so it's the very first
 
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
thing so having a Bill of Rights that
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
enumerates several things is completely
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
within precedent um and we can debate
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
like how broad the language is and can
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
it be narrowed but having the idea that
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
in this state every person will be
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a certain basic quality of
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
life um as a as a effect of us having
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
those values I think that's a debate
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
worth having and so again I would vote
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
down the inter study and I vote down the
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
itl and vote for interim
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
study thank you representative Reed uh
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you Mr chair I
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
I look at these resolutions that it's
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
when we do a house resolution I would
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
think we'd have the majority not just
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
51% but I mean I would think would have
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
like 70 80 or 90% voting for I don't see
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
that happening with this HR at this
 
00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.990 align:start position:0%
that happening with this HR at this
point

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559 align:start position:0%
um a lot in there is is good and it's
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's makes sense to have and I think we
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
do it every day now anyway but I at the
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
same time I think we want to make sure
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
we're get Buy in from as many as
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
possible especially when it's a house
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you representative sers
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative wall thank you and I'm
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
sorry but I really can't say much but
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support the people who want
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
interm Study because there's enough
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
question and concern
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
that it deserves further discussion and
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
therefore I will support those who want
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
in term
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
sty thank you representative wall
 
00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:09.750 align:start position:0%
sty thank you representative wall
forther

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
forther
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
discussion oh representative
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
Reed um once again the interim study the
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
purpose of it I I agree that it
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be an HR it should be a cacr
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
and We Know How likely cacs are to pass
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
anyway but um the purpose of an inter
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
study is to see about recommending what
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
language we might recommend for future
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislation so I think this committee
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
could narrow the language find out
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
language that everyone agrees on and
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
recommend a cacr in the future so I
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
think an inter stud is quite
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you representative
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
Reed um further
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr chairman representative
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
wall I am so sorry uh representative re
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
just brought up a very important point
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes we'll have a bill that
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
simply deserves further discussion and
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
we bring parties together and get
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
problems resolved and we don't need a
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
law but in this particular instance it's
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
important to have further discussion in
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
case there are laws that people feel we
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
need to have um and further legislation
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
developed for so I I will support interm
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
study as I said Thank
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative wall
 
00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:24.430 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative wall
further

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
discussion I will just say
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
um for those that are new to this
 
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
process um interim
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
study in the second year in an election
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
year um makes it kind of difficult and
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
what we're ultimately going to end up
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
with is either a vote on whether the
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
deserves or or whether the HR um
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
deserves further legislation or not um
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's not generally a place where
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
you going to end up bringing in more
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
legislation it's it's more just does it
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
deserve further legislation or not um it
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
will be a discussion I will grant you
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
that um that's what we're doing in
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
interim study um
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
but as far as um the outcome of of
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
fixing legislation Andor coming up with
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
solutions that can be done outside of
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
interim study with with any kind of an
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
ad hoc meeting and in fact I think they
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
had actually mentioned um in the
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
conversation with the prime sponsor and
 
00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:46.510 align:start position:0%
conversation with the prime sponsor and
the

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
testimony I think that's what she said
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
she was looking for um was the ability
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
to have um a caucus um either create a
 
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
caucus but have a
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
discussion it it seems to me um that can
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
be done regardless of the outcome of
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
this uh vote so
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I will be supporting the in uh the
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
itl motion um One Last Time
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you so much
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
for your graciousness Mr chair um I just
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to I think there may have been a
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
misspeaking there because interim study
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
is always a secondy year emotion um it's
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
not ever a first year motion uh retain
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
is the first year motion and interim
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
study is the second year motion which
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
always happens in an election year so
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's just the nature of interim study
 
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
always um so I just wanted to clarify
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.190 align:start position:0%
 
point

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion sorry about
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
that um seeing none uh I will ask the

very well done
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
um what you have in front of you is um
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
is a replace all um after section two um
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
is a an amendment that's going to codify
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
um uh recusals for conflicts of interest
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
um for those of you that don't know the
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
history on this uh I think this is the
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
third year that um we've had uh similar
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
legislation before us
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
um each year started by the chair of the
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee um they have been
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
asking for us to have in statute um
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
recusal which didn't up until now exist
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
in our uh in our vernacular in our
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
ethics book which as you'll see has a
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
lot of writing on it from my end um we
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
have tried uh a number of times we have
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
um uh come up up with Solutions
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves out of this committee uh only
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
to um have uh sought from us changes to
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
the language from the Ethics Committee
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
um we've taken it some to the floor and
 
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
had them taed or Ted them ourselves
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
because other information came up um
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment um is a collaboration of
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh the Ethics Committee and this
 
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.230 align:start position:0%
uh the Ethics Committee and this
committee

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
and um I think represents our best
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um to bring a unified
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
Bill to the Senate um after it passes
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
the house um my understanding is there's
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
another piece of legislation that's
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
coming back to us so we're not done with
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
this um from the Senate I don't know if
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
it'll pass there but um we may not be
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
out of the woods completely um or we may
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
be ending to to in a committee of
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
conference to reconcile the two um what
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
this does is um is provide two
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
categories for conflict of interest um
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
one is a financial interest um which is
 
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
defined on line
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
11 and a nonfinancial interest which is
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
defined on line
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
16 um it also provides exclusions for
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
recusal um and the primary one being
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
anything that um comes as the
 
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
preparation review approval or
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
disapproval of the state budget or any
 
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
General Revenue
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
legislation um it also has a um an
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
exclusion for anyone that um has an
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
incidence of ownership as most of us do
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
through some kind of a retirement plan
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
um in Securities Andor if you are on a
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh a board board um or an officer of uh
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
or ownership less than 5% of the total
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
out actually I think that should be 1%
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the total does the other one say
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
1% um that needs to be looked at
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
um with that uh conflict of interest
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
um would refer to um anyone the
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
legislator a member of the legislator's
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
House hold um that was has been a
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
sticking point in the past um but we've
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
settled on that
 
00:59:32.079 --> 00:59:34.470 align:start position:0%
settled on that
language

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
think there is anything else
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to uh to have questions um
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
if there are any um or further
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
0694 representative
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair thank you to the
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
entire committee on which I am but a sub
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
for taking up this issue um I know it to
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
be an important issue because for
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
example we've had multiple bills
 
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
regarding landlords and there are 43
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
members of the house because I asked I
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
asked Rich Lambert to to pull the
 
01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:25.069 align:start position:0%
asked Rich Lambert to to pull the
information

01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
that receive a significant amount of
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
their income from being a landlord and
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
yet almost none of them have uh declared
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest and recuse
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
themselves from voting so that's that's
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
just one of many many examples and I
 
01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
think it's very important this be taken
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
up I can't say that I'm in a position to
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
fully assess the the new because there's
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of language being added in the
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
amendment however I will trust the work
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
of this committee and other people
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
who've worked on the amendment and hope
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
that through our process it will'll get
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
to the correct
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
language thank you representative Reed I
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
can promise you that there's been much
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussion on on this single piece of
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
paper um representative wall you
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
have well I I'm sorry to bother you with
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
this um question was brought to my
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
attention what if someone is a treasurer
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
for a town how does this work with that
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
or if someone's working on a Town budget
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
how does this work with
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
the um anyone find it ironic that
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
someone sitting on the Ethics Committee
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
asks me that question um so it would
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
seem to me um that uh that this
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
specifically speaks to budgetary
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
questions as an exemption um I would
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
think um and again this is my
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
understanding of the amendment
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
um I would think that would be something
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we certainly should clarify um with
 
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
eth with the Ethics Committee and um uh
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
how they would handle um
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and their and their
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
location rather than me proclaiming what
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
what would happen with it now um is that
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
something that I will I will turn that
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
around to a question is that something
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
that um you have spoken with the members
 
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
of the Ethics Committee with over for
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
some time now as you're aware the Ethics
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
Committee has really struggled with this
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
and um of course we have to declare if
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
any one of us is involved with a budget
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
process in a town or some other
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
organization dealing with money and an
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
issue comes before the
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislature um we have to declare that
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
and my personal belief is we should
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
recuse if we have a direct impact from
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
the issue that's before the legislature
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
and it affects the issues on which we're
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
working on locally thank
 
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative wall um yes
 
01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:08.839 align:start position:0%
representative Lane thank you for
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
letting me um comment as a sub
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
um would it then follow that whatever
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
budget then comes before the town if
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
someone is a city counselor or a select
 
01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.870 align:start position:0%
someone is a city counselor or a select
person

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
refused sorry I'm a lawyer I'm not sorry
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
picky thank you th this amendment and
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation involves
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislators so I I don't see how this
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
addresses conflicts within uh sub
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions at all unless I'm
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
missing it but this is the word legisl
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
legislator occurs multiple almost in
 
01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.630 align:start position:0%
legislator occurs multiple almost in
every

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph yeah I I think it would be a
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
non-financial personal interest that's
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
where it's coming in at least the way I
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
would read this not not a not a um not
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
an income related one I
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
agree then perhaps I misunderstood what
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
you said I thought you were referring to
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
a conflict between two local
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
positions not not a legislative position
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
no I was just uh representative Lane
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you I was commenting on
 
01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.269 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you I was commenting on
representative

01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
walls uh and about the discussion about
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
a Treasurer and so if the treasurer is
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
going to be um held to have a conflict
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
of interest does it not then extend to
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
the select person or the city council
 
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
whatever form of of government they have
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
would that conflict of interest not
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
extend to them as well because they're
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
voting on that budget and they so that
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
that was my question
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Lane
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I think where
 
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
represented L was going is if that
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
Treasurer or the person who sits on the
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
council or board to select me or
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
whatever is also a legislator and
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's an issue before us I think
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's where you're coming from is that
 
01:05:27.269 --> 01:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
correct thank you so let me say that um
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
no don't be sorry um this is what this
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
is all about um so I would say um the
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
disclosure for um the occupation that
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
the legislator had as a bank president
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
um that would still be the same that you
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
would still um notify that at the
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of the your session on all of
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
those the question though is is when um
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
legislation comes up does that
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
legislation um create a conflict and and
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
until you you know what that legislation
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
is it's unclear at that point whether
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
there is a conflict um with their
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
occupation as a bank president or not um
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's an unanswerable question
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
at this point but they would have it
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
would have to be whatever if if that
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
came in to the point of having a
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
financial interest at that point or a
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
non-financial interest it would depend
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
on the context of that question um yep
 
01:06:40.599 --> 01:06:41.630 align:start position:0%
on the context of that question um yep
follow

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
up um I've been on numerous nonprofit
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
boards and um in any time my and also I
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
was a partner in a law firm so I've had
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
to recuse myself new numerous times
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
because of those contacts so but those
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
are all disclosed but I still recuse
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
myself correct from voting okay correct
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
this this is putting that or codifying
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
that in
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
statute um I saw representative
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
Brennan's hand first sorry thank you um
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
there are a number of legislators that
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
serve on local boards such as select
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
boards and City councils would it not be
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
prudent to to um have an exclusion
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for locally elected offices
 
01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:34.839 align:start position:0%
um given that many legislators are um
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
representing their local communities in
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
both ways both as a legislator and a
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
local town office because there are many
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
issues that come before this body that
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
deal with Municipal issues if every
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
person that holds both
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
roles um is forced to recuse
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
themselves we almost lose the direct
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
democracy that this state is quite proud
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
of um so I just wonder if there might be
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
further Amendment
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
necessary um to handle those situations
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brennan um
 
01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brennan um
representative

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
Tierney the only reason a selectman town
 
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
Treasurer anybody would have to recuse
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
themselves is if the bill was basically
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
pointing to their Town only if it is a
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
general bill that's going to affect all
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
the towns municipalities the
 
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
same they've got no extra benefit coming
 
01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
themselves representative Reed
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative partner thank you Mr
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
chair I actually agree with
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney on that um yeah
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
just as an asde if we paid legislators
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
then we wouldn't have to worry about
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
select boards but anyway um I I have a
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
question to the chair this is why I
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
raised my hand and that is it seems like
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of conversation I
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
really want to see this committee pass
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
this even if I don't get to vote on it
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
as a sub um since it's not an early bill
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
would it and I think you said that the
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
line 26 5% needs to be changed to 1%
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
anyway it would it be in order to
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps I don't know if the chair would
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
entertain a subcommittee or something
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
and send it out later chair would not
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
entertain a subcommittee um
 
01:09:29.159 --> 01:09:30.430 align:start position:0%
entertain a subcommittee um
representative

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you um because this
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
specifically references a non-financial
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
personal interest I think it would be
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the Ethics Committee to
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate any kind of confusion that may
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
come up um to in dealing with municipal
 
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.709 align:start position:0%
come up um to in dealing with municipal
officers

01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
um I would highly
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
recommend an exclusion for that
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
specifically thank you thank you
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative BR representative wall
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
well I go back to what represent your
 
01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
name and represent reset if it's
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
specifically for your town if it's
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
specifically to an issue that will
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
affect your town it wouldn't have to say
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
Danbury it wouldn't have to say Handover
 
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't have to say that but if if
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
you have a budgetary issue on uh say the
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
budget that we're voting on um what you
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
would need to do then is figure out if
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
that directly affects your town and the
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
operations of your town and then I
 
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
personally think it would be appropriate
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
to U recuse yourself from that
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
particular vote because it would have a
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
direct impact on your town if it doesn't
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
have a direct impact I don't think you
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
need to um
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
represent representative
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
Kerney agree with most of your statement
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
other than the part that if it affects
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
your town
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
disproportionately to any other town
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
then yes you should recuse yourself if
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
it does not then there is no reason to
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh recuse yourself that's right excuse
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
me Mr chairman representative wall thank
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
you that's exactly right and it goes
 
01:11:24.669 --> 01:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
along with everything else with to any
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
kind of recusal um when it comes before
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature it's always if it's
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
greater than for you whatever interest
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
you have whatever profession you may
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
have or whatever volunteer effort you
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
may have on a particular board that's
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
where the difference comes repres
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
represent tyy said that very explicitly
 
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.149 align:start position:0%
represent tyy said that very explicitly
thank

01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative W uh
 
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I know we have
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
some subs here and we've already
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
discussed this many times in committee
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
before so we're going back many times so
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
it would be nice and I I'll be honest
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
that I think we should take an ethics
 
01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
class two or three times a year because
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's just so I don't want to say
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
divisive but it's so something we need
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
mind thank you representative sers
 
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.480 align:start position:0%

01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to take a two-minute
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
break here for a second uh there's a
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
question of whether um whether
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
OSS flipped the
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
um Amendment numbers so hold on just a
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
second could we do it could we discuss
 
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:52.430 align:start position:0%
second could we do it could we discuss
both

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:16:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
AMS

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:30.430 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
help I don't think she heard you I think
 
01:16:45.159 --> 01:16:52.070 align:start position:0%

don't

01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
costal so what um in further examination
 
01:17:10.719 --> 01:17:11.550 align:start position:0%

us um we brought one up for for
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
conversation and that was um ending in
 
01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:27.709 align:start position:0%
conversation and that was um ending in
0694

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
0694
 
01:17:27.719 --> 01:17:29.270 align:start position:0%
0694

H
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
um there were actually two amendments
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
brought to OS um the other ended in
 
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
um they have taken pieces of one and and
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
not carried them forward into the other
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
so uh there's just
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
enough if it was um simply a case of the
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
the percentage number one and five I
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
would have continued on and just said
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
everyone understand that we're changing
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
that to one and and still vote on it and
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
then we changed the one and go from
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
there but but there's actually a section
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
that whole section not just the
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
percentage but the entire section is
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
missing so I think what I'm going to do
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
is uh recess to a Time certain which
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
would be next week um reconcile the two
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
numbers reconcile the two bills and
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
bring it back to um to us exact next
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
week at the same
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
time any any yes representative wall
 
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.270 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
um that uh the chairman is correct in
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
the error that has occurred and the
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee is leaning towards
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
0693 with that language in it that was
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
left out so hopefully when we recess
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
these get Blended together and we can
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%

original sb84 that came to our committee

if we send this bill over um amended
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
with the same language there would have
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
to be a hearing in the Senate on this
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%

uh for those people that weren't here um
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
1629 is a bill that uh requires the
 
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
notify um the speaker and Senate
 
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
President when they have probable cause
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
to believe someone a
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative is uh or Senator is not
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:16.790 align:start position:0%
um in
District

01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
um it opens up an enormous number number
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
of questions from that point on um some
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
of which uh are dealing with um the fact
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
that there's a blank in the in the
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
legislation of what what's supposed to
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
happen with that knowledge um does the
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
does the Senate President or the um or
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
the speaker if they are conducting an
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
investigation their own are they are
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
they supposed to stop that investigation
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
as is what happens within our own Ethics
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
Committee um when they hear of an
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
investigation they stop investigating
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
themselves um are conversely are the
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
Senate President and speaker supposed to
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
start investigating on their own um the
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
bill is silent on that um if in fact
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
they do their own investigation and they
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
reach a conclusion and then that
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion happens to be different than
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
what the Attorney General's
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
um um investigation turns out what
 
01:52:34.109 --> 01:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
happens then no one the bill is silent
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
um there's also the question right off
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
the bat um of what happens if the
 
01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:40.950 align:start position:0%
the bat um of what happens if the
Attorney

01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
General doesn't want this type of um
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
action um they we don't this is this is
 
01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:50.870 align:start position:0%
action um they we don't this is this is
um

01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
this is a procedure that's happening
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
within the house so you need to
 
01:52:57.390 --> 01:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
recognize that we're actually um
 
01:52:59.390 --> 01:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
crossing the separation of powers at
 
01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
this point um and generally the Attorney
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
General doesn't like
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
disclosing um any investigations even up
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
to and including U the grand jury um
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
they very rarely if ever um announced
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
that anyone is under investigation so
 
01:53:24.189 --> 01:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
this this is a this is a lot of
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions um to me it demands interim
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
study I will be voting in favor of
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
interim study um uh there's just there's
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
just too many unanswered questions here
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
um so for that reason I will be voting
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
interim study and if there's no further
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
discuss up representative Reed thank you
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is an issue I've been here
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is my fourth term I I this is an
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
issue that comes up every single term it
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
not just this term quite famously but
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
every single term I've been here there
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
has been a member that apparently was
 
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
not living in their district and that is
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional legal I think we have
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
to do something about it and while I
 
01:54:09.629 --> 01:54:09.639 align:start position:0%
concede that um perhaps there could be
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
stronger language I think this is a step
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the right direction so I would like
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
to see it ought to
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
pass thank you representative Reed
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you Mr chair
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
and and again I I I don't think
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
anybody's saying this doesn't have Merit
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
and like representative Reed just said I
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
mean every year I it's definitely a
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
problem but I I think you got to get the
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
language right we got to make sure it's
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
almost perfect because so many times
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
there's been so many holes and languages
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
and just one word you know and it causes
 
01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
us turmoil and we can't solve a problem
 
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
which should be very clear so I think
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
this in stud is the best way to go to
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
get this it out Al
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
together thank you representative cers
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I think I saw
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I have a question
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
um con concerning the procedural part of
 
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
this perhaps you can you can help me
 
01:55:05.709 --> 01:55:05.719 align:start position:0%
here uh the Attorney General shall
 
01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
notify the presiding officer the
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
minority leader and and the clerk of the
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
relevant chamber what happens if that
 
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
person is the one being
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
investigated since this is a this is
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
forcing a procedure uh thank you for
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
your question I I assume that was a
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
question to the chair um I have no idea
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
um the bill is silent on that point um
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
um it it it is another of in a long line
