00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yes we are ready um so just just
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
before we get started I I have uh some
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
suggested language that I just asked
 
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
Jennifer to go make copies so we can all
 
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
so we would all we would all have it um
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
so this is uh the committee of
 
00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
conference on uh uh House Bill
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
1069 um thank you all for coming
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um there were um as as
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
I've sort of looked at this I I think
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
there are there are sort of two issues
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
one is is kind of a narrow fix that I
 
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
think um I I think I hope will be
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
non-controversial the other is a little
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
bit broader um that
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
I personally I'm kind of agnostic on but
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
I can see the arguments on both sides
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe we you know we should have a
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
discussion of the little broader one but
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
um uh first uh the two things that um
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
were the Where were the U basic reason
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
for our the house requesting a committee
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
of conference were um there is language
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the Senate version of the bill um
 
00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
that that we were
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
concerned uh could could um and it's the
 
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
the language I'm referring to uh says
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm quoting here no charge shall be
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
made for records delivered
 
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
made for records delivered
electronically

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
and I think what this what the Senate
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
intended by that and actually the house
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
has so much similar language um is that
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
you meant by that no charge shall be
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
made for clicking the send button and
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
having it delivered um and we don't have
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
we're completely in agreement with that
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
as I said there's sort of similar
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
language in in the house version what we
 
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
were concerned about is
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
arguably that could be
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
read would you mind Jen could you would
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
you mind just giving it to the all the
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
much um arguably that could be read to
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
mean no no charge can be made for
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
records delivered electronically that
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
that includes not only hitting the send
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
button but any of the prior work of of
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
in other words if the records are
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
delivered electronically then there can
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
be no charge even if it would the the
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
town you know were faced with more than
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
250 emails and not more than 250
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
electronic communications which was the
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
subject of a,2 so we were concerned that
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
it this could be could be read as
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
conflicting with a th000 with house bill
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
,000 2 so a proposed
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
change that I have't I've I've asked
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
that this be passed around i' I've
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
worked off the Senate uh version of 1069
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
with your
 
00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.550 align:start position:0%
with your
Amendment

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
um where is it
 
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
1966 s um so what what I would propose
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
to change there is
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
page two of of that amendment in section
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
in section four of the bill uh Roman
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
numeral 5- a parenthesis B so I changed
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
the language in the last sentence to say
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
no charge shall be made for the delivery
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
of Records electronically comma but a
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable charge may be made for the
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
time necessary to process the request if
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
authorized by this chapter and I have to
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
I had to word it that way because we
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't say the specific section
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
because the governor hasn't signed a
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
1002 yet and so it's not really law
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
right now so that's why I worded it that
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
way um so that would take care of I
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
think that would take care of that issue
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
it would make it clear that what we're
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
saying you you can't you can't charge
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
for the electronic delivery delivery
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
being a sort of you know that what we
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
mean by that is pressing the send button
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
you can't charge for that um but if
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's if if it meets the requirements
 
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.470 align:start position:0%
there's if if it meets the requirements
of

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
a,2 that is it's more than 250
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
electronic communications or whatever
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
you could charge for the time necessary
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman um you're talking about
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
to put everything together versus
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
because you're talking here about the
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
electronic delivery but now you're
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
talking about the work that it's taking
 
00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:38.269 align:start position:0%
talking about the work that it's taking
okay

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
exactly okay do you have language that
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
speaks to that I I do so I what I said
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
is um okay well the delivery no no
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
charge should be made for the delivery
 
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
of Records electronically but a
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable charge may be made for the
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
time necessary to process the request if
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
authorized by this chapter and so that
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
would be that would you know by if
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
authorized by this chapter really means
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
if 1,2 would allow it right I understand
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
that um okay I'm the only thing I'm
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about and it's anything that
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
91a there are a lot of people that
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
follow 91a they they're very uh
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about changes and I'm I'm just
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
concerned about what is a reasonable
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
charge um and
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
usually it's laid out when you're doing
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
it by paper there's a cost per page but
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
what is a reasonable charge here because
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
in 2000 at
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
10002 they um you could do the 250
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
requests it doesn't cost you anything
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
but now you're instituting a reasonable
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
charge gosh and I'm concerned that
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to be a little in conflict
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
and in when we had the public care on
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
one um on this on the other Bill one2 a
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
lot of people were concerned about cost
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
if there were any cost and they get
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
those 250 for free but now you're saying
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
here if uh if it's electronic they're
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
going to be charged what is considered
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
to be a reasonable cost well you know so
 
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe would it does it help if I
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
take out the word reasonable in other
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
words what I the only thing I meant to
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
say by that is is the the really I think
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
the key the key point is the last words
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
if authorized by this chapter and what
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
that in other words what that is really
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
what that means is it's authorized by
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
this chapter only if it meets the
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
requirements of a,2 okay so so if I yeah
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
I I would just bring up um I've been in
 
00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:54.519 align:start position:0%
communication with um my town manager
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
they just
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
recently um completed a c a request one
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
request that
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
was an unbelievable amount it cost them
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
$25,000 to produce what this person
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
asked for and that was just one request
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
um in two
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
one2 that's free that doesn't cost
 
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
anything so I'm concerned that this is
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
going to conflict it was all electronic
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
all the information was submitted uh
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
electronically back to the person
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
so I I'm just concerned that we're doing
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
something here that maybe we need to be
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about yeah well you
 
00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759 align:start position:0%
know what so if in other words if if you
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
I think if your concern was that by put
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
by having the word reasonable in there
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
that could mean in other words that that
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
somehow a somebody a court or whatever
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
could find that a charge was reasonable
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
even if it didn't meet the criteria of
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
a,2 I I see what you're saying and so
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
what if we just took the word reasonable
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
out so it would say but a charge may be
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
made uh for the time necessary to
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
process the request if authorized by
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
this chapter which that really means is
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
if authorized by a,2 I quite frankly I
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't my my problem is not with
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable it's with
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
charge um and I don't know if that's
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to if that's going to conflict
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
because um I think if you're going to
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
charge it should should be something
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable but what is what what do you
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
consider to be reasonable and that's
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
where you're going to run into issues
 
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
because everyone is going to look each
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
each Community could decide what
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
unreasonable is there's no one
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
particular standard other than they may
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
charge if they so choose to and I can
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
pretty well but isn't the key here if
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
authorized by this chapter so the only
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
and the only authorization the chapter
 
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.069 align:start position:0%
and the only authorization the chapter
is

00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
a,2 right and that is after
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
250 so it is going beyond the
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
$250 a 250 requests so I I don't feel
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this again because
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
right to know is very tenuous and people
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
get really upset about it this is
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
something new um so I think we can
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
continue to have a discussion about it
 
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:29.799 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
sure I'm just concerned representative
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
tur and then representative Smith oh I'm
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
sorry uh yeah so just looking at this um
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
one thought is I I think the real
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
question for me or problem with this for
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
me is the word time because time is what
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
was taken out of 102 from its original
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
form versus what past eventually was on
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
a per reccord basis and that's the part
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
that I think worries me about
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of changes my understanding is
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
when we say you know you know request
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
authorized by this chapter 102 doesn't
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
really have a Time component in it
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
anymore so I was thinking since this is
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
really B and correct me if a different
 
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.669 align:start position:0%
really B and correct me if a different
understanding

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
B um 5ab is basically talking about the
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
process of delivering the thing not the
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
process of producing the the record and
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
so I was thinking if we just basically
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
sort of said clarified that no delivery
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
charge would be made and then leave the
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
other parts out because 102 sort of
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
takes care of that so I don't know what
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
folks think of that but I I I worry
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
about putting too much language in here
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
and sort of relying on the passage of
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
102 to to sort of clean it up on the
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
back end yeah so I'm sorry
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm having a a funny
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
kind of problem in terms of what hat I
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
should be wearing I I know that I'm here
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
to um support the house
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
position uh as compared with the Senate
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
position and
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
um I this is new this language is new I
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
hadn't seen it before um as an
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
alternative to the house position but to
 
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.430 align:start position:0%
alternative to the house position but to
me

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
problem the problem isn't the word
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable the problem is the word
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
charge and um one hopes that we would
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
never consider charging anything that
 
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't reasonable we would never do a
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
thing like that never never um and I
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't understand how this helps support
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
the house position and at the same time
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
bring us closer to being able to reach
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
accommodation with the Senate um am I
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
missing something
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
here so I I guess what I would say is
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
this so Eric are you may maybe your
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
language is does the trick in other
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
words you you would say
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
no no delivery charge shall be made for
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
records produced electronically does
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
that does that with with putting aside
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
the concerns that representative Smith
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
had for a moment do would that would
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
that solve your issue U well thank you
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
um it's it's already there all we did in
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate was we just took the language
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
that you sent us and we just
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
reconfigured it a little bit right um
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
and so it already says no charge shall
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
be made for records deliver
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
electronically I think that's very
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
clear um it because you're talking about
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
the delivery it's it is hitting that
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
send button to somebody who requested
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
the information well see but you know
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
what the pro I mean that's
 
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:20.919 align:start position:0%
certainly one reasonable interpretation
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
of it and that's and you know that's
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
what as I said before I think that we we
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
sort of assume that's what you meant but
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
that's not the only interpretation you
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
could read no charge shall be made for
 
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
records delivered electronically you
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
could read that to mean if the records
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
are sent by hitting the send button no
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
charge can be made for those records no
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
matter what the the prior circumstances
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
were about getting the information in
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
other words even if it is more than 250
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
emails whereas I think Eric Eric we
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
restructured the language just a little
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
bit but I think can you say can you read
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
it was it was just to clarify the
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
difference between the two
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
interpretations that I think uh uh
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn is talk chairman
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
Lynn is talking about um basically by
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
adding the word delivery it takes the
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
ambiguity out because the way it's
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
written now it could sound like it could
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
override 102 which does allow for
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
charges if you exceed the 250 records so
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
by saying delivery it sort of makes this
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph B just about you know the
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
difference between post postage versus
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's no postage if you're if you're
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
hitting the send button so it's just a
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
one word it would be just a onew change
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
and and I would hope not not bring in
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
those questions about reasonableness and
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
and time you know and the other stuff
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
that sort of bogged down for a while 102
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chair I guess I guess the
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
the issue is to put these uh object is
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
delivery not records so by I as I
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
understand it um to
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
move shall be made four and the four the
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
object of four is delivery not records
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
so it's really just changing records and
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
swapping records and
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
delivery is that what is that well I you
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
know what I think in other words I I I
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
think that the way rep representative
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
tur phrased it um does do that yeah you
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
right no in other words no delivery if
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
you if you say it if you refer to it as
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
delivery charge it's a specific kind of
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
charge a charge for delivery so no
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
delivery charge shall be made for
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
records produced electronically that
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
would that would be my thought I I think
 
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
that I mean I'm I'm perfectly
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that if everybody else
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
is and represent Smith I you you may I
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
realize you may not be but so if if you
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
that have a further comment on that
 
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
particularly I have to admit that I'm a
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
product of progressive education so
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
parts of speech I'm not so you know good
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
at um I barely know a subject from a
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
predicate so I look to the senator as
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
being far superior to me in in her
 
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.830 align:start position:0%
being far superior to me in in her
educational

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
educational
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
ability um
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh but um I I would like to ask Senator
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
Carson I'm delighted to sit here with
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
you we haven't sat together in a long
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
time um about your
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
$25,000 figure because I'm curious
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
about what caused that
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
$25,000 and wonder and I've had this
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
discussion over these
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
bills quite a bit including with the
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and others about
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
why H how how those charges get so high
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
and is it that immediately an attorney
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
is called in and hired not someone on
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
staff to do what one might think would
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
be routine work uh you know what
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
composes that comprises that
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
25,000 from what I've Been Told um it is
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
an individual who made the request going
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
2017 of all police activity in the town
 
00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.070 align:start position:0%
2017 of all police activity in the town
of

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
London so as you can imagine anybody who
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
had any contact with the police you've
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
got to redact their names you've got to
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
go through all of that and I I just you
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
look at the volume of the paperwork that
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
had to have been gone through in order
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
to do that um do you know if anybody
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
picked up the phone and said what do you
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
need this information for I don't
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
believe that you can ask them they they
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
make the request and you have to you
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
have to do what they give them what
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
they've asked for you don't get to
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
qualify it you don't need you I I mean
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
in fact I was having a conversation with
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
somebody that maybe in the next step of
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
reforming and that's what we're trying
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
to do here of um article 91a is to
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
create that the ability for the
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
municipality to reach out and said you
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
know hey what what is it exactly that
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
you're looking for um you have some
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
people that this is what I want and I
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
want it all but they really don't have
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
the ability I we do have the right to
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
know on budsman I don't know um uh it's
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
due to for a while go out in to in
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
2025 and I think next year would be a
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
good time to look at it it'll be a
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
budget year whether or not we want to
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
extend that from what I understand he uh
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
he does a lot of things for people they
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
do call them but there's got to be a
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
point where there can be some sort of
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
negotiation between an individual and a
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
municipality over the volume of what
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
someone is looking for and you know it
 
00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
can be done in a way well you know we
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
want to answer your request can you
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
please you know narrow it down for us
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
what exactly are you looking for but
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
from what I understand sometimes that
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
happens but sometimes it doesn't well
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
you know just just on that point I mean
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
we there is language now in
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
A2 y that says it it's not exactly as
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
strong as you you suggest but it says
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
that the the town can sort of if uh have
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
some discussion with the requester about
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
um what you know sort of what are you
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
looking for in an effort to try to
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
narrow the request which I think is a
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
good thing yeah I I do too because um
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
that was only one of the requests um
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
we've had another one that's cost and
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's been a series of requests that have
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
cost the town this was last year I
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
believe in um September October I was
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
told uh
 
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
$35,000 and so these things add up after
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
a while and um this this is taxpayer
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
money this is not money that you know a
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
municipality is hidden away in a room
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
someplace this is all the taxpayers are
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
paying for it and I think when you have
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
small requests there most certainly
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
please you know give them what they want
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
but when You' get these huge requests I
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
it becomes a burden on the municipality
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
and it causes uh you know t a good
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
amount of taxpayer dollars to be used so
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
um you have to honor that it is in our
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
constitution but I do think that um you
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
know there there should be a way for the
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
municipality and the individual who's
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
the requester to have a conversation
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
about what are you looking for can we
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
help you narrow this down that helps you
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
that helps me or the municipality get
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
through this process sooner and I think
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's something that we can try to do I
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
agree I agree with so let me go back to
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
them qu is would everybody be
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable if we change
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
if we took the Senate version of this
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
and on
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
lines 29 and 30 we changed the language
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
to read no delivery charge shall be made
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
for records produced
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
electronically everybody all right with
 
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
that I can't agree to that at this point
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm increasingly concerned with all
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
the corresponden I'm getting from um
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
Town manager
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
just got one handed to me a few minutes
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
ago from the Hudson police chief um
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
phone calls that I've gotten from local
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
officials I think that we are opening up
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
a Pandora's Box I know the house of
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
passed a bill Senate passed a bill um I
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't know that we know the
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
ramifications and the cost of this and
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I'm going to be able
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
to agree to um
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
this I do like the fact that
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
on um representative Lynn online 23 that
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
you have um changed from person to
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
member of the media or somebody with a
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire address but I I I'm not
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm ready to say this is a
 
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
to so I guess
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
the I'm just wondering if if we I guess
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
the thing I'm I'm not sure I understand
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
though Senator is this if we left the
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
language the way it is in the Senate
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment right what I mean what what do
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
you think that means then in terms of
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
electronic um of of what happens when
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
records are delivered electronically
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
that that's the thing I'm not clear that
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
understand could could I could I ask a
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
question of the president sure um are
 
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.990 align:start position:0%
question of the president sure um are
you

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.950 align:start position:0%
you
saying

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
that you could not support if it came to
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
pass that the house decided to
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
accept the Senate
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
version as it as you approved it that
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
you are not prepared to accept
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm saying that I am increasingly
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
concerned with all the correspondents
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
I've had since we passed this version
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago that
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
um I am increasingly concerned with
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
opening up a Pandora's Box for local
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
officials um without knowing the
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
ramifications or the cost because of you
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
know some of the correspondents I've
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
received and I think it was the town of
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
Tilton talked to me a former state
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
senator who's the town manager now um
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
request that was 400 hours and then the
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
person didn't even um pick up the
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
information so I just I don't know this
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
is so Senator inly a concern okay so
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley what you're saying is
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
despite my
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
naive no one naive here oh yes my naive
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that the house has a
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
position that the house conferees are
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
presenting and the Senate has a position
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
that the Senate conf that you are not
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
supporting the Senate because of some of
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
the correspondence that I've received
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
since the Senate voted on this a couple
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
of weeks ago I thank you that's very
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
important saying absolutely no never but
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
I I think that some of the concerns that
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
local officials have raised have not
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
been addressed in either version so you
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
know what can I Senator I'll get you
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
just in just one sec but Senator Bradley
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
the thing I'm
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
having that I'm having some difficulty
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
with is is this if as representative
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
Smith pointed out I mean suggested if
 
00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
the house were to Simply concur with the
 
00:33:47.799 --> 00:33:49.430 align:start position:0%
the house were to Simply concur with the
Senate

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
Amendment and if
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of the current
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
language on lines 29 and 30
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
correct then at least one arguable
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that of that version
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
would be no charge should be made for
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
records delivered electronically if that
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
can be interpreted and I think it could
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
be to say if the records are delivered
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
electronically there can be no charge
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
even if it's more than 250 electronic
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
communication or whatever I mean I I
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
guess the thing I'm to the extent that
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
your concern is is imposed closing and
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
undo burden on towns it would seem to me
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
that that this could be read the Senate
 
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
version right now could be read to mean
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's more of a burden on towns because
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
they can't charge at all I suspect you
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
are correct with that so that I mean
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
there's the conundrum that's so I mean I
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
but I guess I I mean
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
that's the Senate has I mean with with
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
with differeny you're having a a a
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
different view I understand but the
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
Senate has passed this so if if I may um
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
that language is language that we agreed
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
from the house the only difference here
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
is the change of the word from P from
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
citizen to person that's the only change
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
this this is all the language that we
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
got from the house we just restructured
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
it but it's all there the only
 
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
difference and I see where there would
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
be angst with changing it from citizen
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
to person because when you talk about
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
citizen you're talking about citizen of
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire person it
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
leaves It Wide Open for anybody and
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's the emails that I have been
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
getting that people are concerned that
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
this is way too open anybody from any
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
place in the
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
world can request um these records and
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's a reason reason why well I'll
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
tell you why we did that um there's two
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
reasons one is in regards to a case
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
currently that's going on in Rochester
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
where the uh newspaper editor lives in
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
Maine and familiar with the he's trying
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
to get the request he writes his
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
newspaper is in Rochester they will not
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
honor his 91a request because he is not
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
a citizen of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
he lives in MA that's one reason the
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
other reason is we have people that live
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
here in our here in our state that are
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
here legally they're immigrants here
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
legally that pay taxes to the state of
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they pay Municipal Taxes
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
but they're not
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
citizens so they can't make a 91a
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
request if it if you're going to Define
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state they're not IL
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
legal they're not citizens yet they're
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
here legally they're doing everything
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
right they're doing the right
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
thing but by using the word citizen they
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
can't they just can't they can't it
 
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply oh even though they're
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers yes Senator I'm sorry um no
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um I appreciate it and I I do
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
understand it is an interesting position
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
to be in when we do wear different hats
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
and I am here um to represent the
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
position of the Senate and um
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
I I am very supportive of the right to
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
know and want to make sure that people
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
have access to it I do like the steps
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
that have been suggested to put some um
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
I don't want to use the word guardrails
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
but nothing else is coming to mind but
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
to put some conditions that are
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate on it so that we don't run
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
into the issues that uh Senator Bradley
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
described that I mean it is unduly
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
burdensome to some uh towns and I
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
believe that language is that language
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
undo burden is that in that is that is
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
in the yes that is in the um yes um but
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can you reference um if
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill one is it one2 becomes law um
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
is it make it conditional upon the
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
passage of that particular
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and that could be a way to
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I mean can I guess we can
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
we do that can we Jennifer can we make
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
it reference can we say you know no no
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
charge no delivery charge shall be made
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
records uh um but other charges may be
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
for the section like this
 
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.430 align:start position:0%
for the section like this
to

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
h2w then this section would be enacted I
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
think without CC that they could
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
structure something like
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
that I believe that's not uncommon Mr
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
chair um where um we do refer to other
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
legislation um as a condition um we do
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
it I think with some
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
frequency I have
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
a I have a more basic question why did
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
agree to a committee of conference if
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
there might be a belief in the Senate
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
they don't want this to go ahead is that
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
is that a processed question that you
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to address now I can
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
polite Mr President I've known you for a
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
long time and I know you are polite and
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
you are careful and you
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
are precise but you also don't like to
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's all I'll say so you know what can
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
I yes if I may um I might be able to
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
answer that for you um the morning um
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
that this came that we had to make
 
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
decisions about this I had a meeting
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
with um members from the municipal
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
Association who wanted us to do a lot
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
more than what this bill really
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
addressed we I I'm not going to say we I
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
said no
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
because with the right to know you
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
cannot slip anything or try to put
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
something through without having a
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing you just cannot do that
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
um and I just said no and then probably
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
within an hour I started getting emails
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
from municipalities saying to kill this
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
so um I don't agree with that kind
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
of things that happen um I feel that
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
this there is a uh a value to any bill
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
and it's the people that are sitting at
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
this table who makes the decisions I
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your cander Senator I
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much had figured that out all by
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
my own self as to how we got here and
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
I'm very glad that you shared that with
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
us and it does show the difficulty that
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
we have as to how we make make these
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
decisions um and to my knowledge
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
actually um we weren't elected by the
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
municipal Association that's all I want
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
to say so you know what um I guess um
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things um this sort
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
of mels over into the the the citizen
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
person issue um I think it's important
 
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
to understand that the the even the
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
current law which says which uses the
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
word citizen it doesn't Define Citizen
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
and as far as I know there's no case law
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
that says citizen means a citizen of the
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
town or citizen means a citizen of the
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
state or citizen means a citizen of the
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
United States so um it's or the world I
 
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.030 align:start position:0%
United States so um it's or the world I
suppose

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's to the extent that that we are
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from various and I've gotten
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
some of those too from municipalities
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
that you know the sky is falling if we
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
change citizen to person um apparently
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
you know it was the the it certainly
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
would be an argument that citizen means
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
citizen of the United States under
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
current law yet we haven't you know we
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
haven't had like a flood of you know uh
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
California somebody as as as my my
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
former colleague judge smuckler used to
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
say somebody Jammy surfing at midnight
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
in California deciding to make a request
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
to somewhere in New Hampshire so I'm not
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much of a concern that
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm I guess I don't really un know if
 
00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
if we're going to unless we unless the
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
theory is to
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
just sort of tank this whole bill and I
 
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
I I assume that you're here so you
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
nobody's particularly interested in
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
doing that um I I I think we're still
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
really back to this issue of what you
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
know what do we want to say about
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
delivery charges for electronic
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
records that's Mr chairman um if I can
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
suggest that we take like a five minute
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
recess where um the Senate can discuss
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
these proposed changes because I think
 
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
at this point we're just going round
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
sure we're just going around and around
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
I don't want to waste anyone's time
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's fine surek absolutely let's do
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
can we um meet is there a place where we
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
can right through here oh you're right
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
in there yeah right in there and I'll
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
make sure I turn off the uh Shi Sheriff
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
tier recording
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
device Mr chairman I heard you have all
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
kind of snacks back
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%

00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
us thank you I think we're better off um
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
agreeing to disagree and with apologies
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
that um we did not have adequate time to
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing on some of the
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
request to uh mitigate some of the
 
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
issues in the bill with the um changes
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
that were asked for by the municipal
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
Association um Senator Carson had over
 
00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:10.230 align:start position:0%
Association um Senator Carson had over
60

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
60
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
bills that came over from the house with
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
less time as you know senate had more
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
time on Senate Bill's house had more
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
time it just didn't happen and I think
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
as Senator Carson has
 
00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:29.039 align:start position:0%
explained um changes to the 91a need to
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
be more than carefully considered and as
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
I said before the implications for
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
towns um are significant and the number
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
of towns that have contacted I I suspect
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
you folks and us too um since the Senate
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
passed the bill I I could not have
 
00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
supported it at the time knowing the Imp
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
applications of it so I think all of us
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
are better off waiting until well I
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
won't be here but others will be till
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
next year to um move forward with it
 
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.069 align:start position:0%
next year to um move forward with it
knowing

00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
that house bill 102 which the prime
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill is a co-sponsor of
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
um is on its way to the governor because
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
you passed it we passed it and um it's
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
on its way so so I so I'm I'm sorry
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
was is that are you basically saying
 
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
that the Senate's position is going to
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
be simply to non-c concur I I I think
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
that that would be the best outcome yes
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
okay all right no that's
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
uh so okay all right thank you very good
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
all right it's always a pleasure to see
 
00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.950 align:start position:0%
all right it's always a pleasure to see
you

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative yeah and just you know
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
bring this forward again next year right
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
when one2
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
ISL right right well it'll be I wonder
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
you know it'll be I wonder if there's a
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
um if if the situation in uh Rochester
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
will end up leading to a Supreme Court
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
decision on this issue that uh which may
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
end up the may may at least the major
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
issue of what is a citizen will be will
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
be decided and I cannot imagine that
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
they would say citizen means just a
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
citizen of the town and so so the
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
Rochester that Rochester newspaper can't
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
get the records because the owner lives
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
in Maine I mean I that would be
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
mindboggling if they were to say that I
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
I think anyway all right well thank you
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it's always a
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you and here you're my
 
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
fellow Judiciary members thank you same
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
