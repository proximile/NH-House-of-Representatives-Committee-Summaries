um
 
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
so this is a work session on HB 652
 
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
which was retained and I should note
 
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 align:start position:0%
that all the members of the subcommittee
 
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
are myself as chair representative di
 
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo who is not here she emailed me
 
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
to indicate she was Ill she would be
 
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and then representative Tripp
 
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 align:start position:0%
and representative Perez who are present
 
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.709 align:start position:0%
and representative Perez who are present
um

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
one of the um
 
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
so the issue is what we should do with
 
00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh this proposed bill that the the uh
 
00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
the bill would
 
00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
91a3 uh Roman numeral 2C to add language
 
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
that says that if um
 
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.810 align:start position:0%
that says that if um
if

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
a public body goes into non-public
 
00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
session to discuss matters which
 
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
um if discussed in public would
 
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
adversely affect the reputation of
 
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
certain people
 
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.249 align:start position:0%
certain people
um

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh then the the person whose reputation
 
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
would be might be adversely effective
 
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
would have a right to be notified
 
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.109 align:start position:0%
would have a right to be notified
um

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh and be present
 
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.609 align:start position:0%
uh and be present
um

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh however have council president speak
 
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
on his or her own behalf
 
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 align:start position:0%
on his or her own behalf
um

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
so that that is the issue
 
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.230 align:start position:0%
so that that is the issue
um

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
I guess I
 
00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
um well I guess I'd want to hear from
 
00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
where what what are members of the
 
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.130 align:start position:0%
where what what are members of the
subcommittee

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
it was silly because why would you be a
 
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.610 align:start position:0%
it was silly because why would you be a
non-public

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
if you want someone else to understand
 
00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
or to know what's being discussed
 
00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.490 align:start position:0%
or to know what's being discussed
uh

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
but then again on the further reflection
 
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
if you're discussing someone there there
 
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
might be some justification for uh doing
 
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410 align:start position:0%
might be some justification for uh doing
so

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.030 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
but I'm still uh in the middle on this
 
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
and you know I think if you were being
 
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
by law I have a right to know you're
 
00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.190 align:start position:0%
by law I have a right to know you're
accuser

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be accused I don't I
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
think it should be now publicly because
 
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think the entire
 
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
town or city should know about it
 
00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
until it's discussed and made
 
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's real but I think if you're accused
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
of something
 
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
you should have the right
 
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
to be present to hear
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
what you're being accused of or who's
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
complaining about you
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
you need to be able to hear your side of
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
the story I mean that's the whole thing
 
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
and if you can't be there you can't do
 
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
that I'll give an example I just had a
 
00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
record in the button here and explain
 
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
about me I had to go before
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
the group here I mean to discuss it
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know whether in the Bible or it was
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
a Bible it was but you know I mean if I
 
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't there they could just take the
 
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
word of this person and
 
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
Target by reputation
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
so I really feel that
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to make it if it's
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
non-criminal or criminal or whatever I
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
think we're discussing I just think
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
people have a right to know what's being
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
said about them and what they're being
 
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
accused of and
 
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.070 align:start position:0%
accused of and
um

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
so you know one of I mean the the
 
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that I had about
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
about the way the bill was worded thus
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
far is that it was very expansive
 
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.950 align:start position:0%
far is that it was very expansive
um

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
in other words beer and and you know I
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%
sort of gave the example I think at one
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
point of if you're tired I suppose
 
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
you're gonna
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
somehow you uh
 
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
you're gonna be talking you know maybe
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
the town has uh has bought uh
 
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
Vehicles made in Japan and they're not
 
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
happy with the vehicles and they're
 
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
going to say something terrible about uh
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
they they think that uh uh
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
well what was that who was the one that
 
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
was uh what was the uh the company that
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen wasn't it that they they were
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
cooking the books on uh environmental
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
things so they're gonna so we the town
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
has bought Volkswagens they're unhappy
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh they think that uh the president of
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen because you know has been
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
accused of is uh is a bad guy and
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're gonna talk about him at this at
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
a meeting so they so they um they're
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
gonna have the meeting they're gonna
 
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
have a closed meeting do they have to
 
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
give notice to the president of
 
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
give notice to the president of
Volkswagen

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen
 
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.409 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen
um

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
my concern is just how how very broad
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
that was so what what I was thinking is
 
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
um if the person whose reputation may be
 
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
adversely affected is a resident of the
 
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.930 align:start position:0%
adversely affected is a resident of the
jurisdiction

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
over which the public body has Authority
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
so if it's a town it would be the town
 
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
if it was a state body it would be
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
somebody that's a resident of the state
 
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
then the person gets no so that um
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
that was one thing that at least would
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
kind of cabin in who we're talking about
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
um but the other thing that that
 
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.670 align:start position:0%
um but the other thing that that
um

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
the representative from the admissible
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
Association was just briefly I was just
 
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
discussing it with him before we started
 
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
he raises I think a very a really
 
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.890 align:start position:0%
he raises I think a very a really
interesting

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
point is
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
I mean example that he gave is suppose
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
that the town has received information
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
that the town clerk has been cooking the
 
00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
books or stealing money or something
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.409 align:start position:0%
like that
um

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.330 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
does the does the
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
and they want to discuss it the
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
Selectmen want to discuss it do they
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
have to give the town clerk notice that
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
um that they're going to be talking
 
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.230 align:start position:0%
um that they're going to be talking
about

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.010 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
about that issue because
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
I mean I would think that would be a
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
real problem because if they do
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe the the product
 
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
the evidence is going to disappear or uh
 
00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
there's going to be there's going to be
 
00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:46.850 align:start position:0%
there's going to be there's going to be
um

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%
there'll be there would be some problem
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:50.749 align:start position:0%
with that
um

00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:52.490 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:52.500 --> 00:08:00.890 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
what about if you make it
 
00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:18.050 align:start position:0%
what about if you make it
for

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
none criminal charges or something I
 
00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
mean what if you make it for
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't know it was if the intent
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
of this bill was to have it for
 
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.330 align:start position:0%
of this bill was to have it for
everything

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know towns was it more the intent
 
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.050 align:start position:0%
you know towns was it more the intent
for

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539 align:start position:0%
um you know nasty stuff that goes on
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
in a town perhaps and somebody
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
complaining about somebody or somebody
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
doing this or doing that I don't know I
 
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.030 align:start position:0%
doing this or doing that I don't know I
mean

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
can can we ask can we ask questions yeah
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative what was your intent was
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
it for the entire
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
everything to cover Encompass everything
 
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
I thank you
 
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.250 align:start position:0%
I thank you
sure

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
I I've had an experience where I was on
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
a on a board in my community and we did
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
have a situation that did involve
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
something like that with a member a
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel member
 
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
get the information you need to discuss
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
it before you start discussing it
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
and if that person wants to provide more
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
information that would help you to
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
understand it that's that's great maybe
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's what's not necessary
 
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.050 align:start position:0%
that's what's not necessary
uh

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
but I know there was there was
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
definitely every effort made to be
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
extremely fair to this Personnel member
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
by the board by the by the director by
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
everyone involved
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
and when we discussed it it was the
 
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
first time I'd ever heard anything about
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
it and anything negative about this
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
person and I would have been happy to
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
hear from that person and find out more
 
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:07.019 align:start position:0%
if that person had an explanation that
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
would have helped me to understand it
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
I I unfortunately didn't have that
 
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.790 align:start position:0%
I I unfortunately didn't have that
option

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
but there was enough evidence to move
 
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
forward appropriately
 
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
and that was what was done but if a
 
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.370 align:start position:0%
and that was what was done but if a
person

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
is entrusted with with the funds of the
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
community you talked about an example of
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
a state of um sorry a town clerk
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
and there's some sort of serious
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
allegation made about embezzlement of
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
funds or something Criminal
 
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.329 align:start position:0%
funds or something Criminal
well

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
they should have an explanation for that
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
there should be some explanation if the
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
if they're innocent
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
and if they're not then they're not
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
going to be able to make a good case for
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
that and then the decision makers of
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
that Community would have to move
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
forward in the way that they think is
 
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
best yeah I guess you know I think the
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
problem I see with this is that we're
 
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.750 align:start position:0%
problem I see with this is that we're
we're

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
if we drag if we
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
go along with this proposal remember
 
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
you're talking about even
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
right from the beginning
 
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
the person would have the right to
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
notice I mean if we
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
you know so if we if you were to adopt
 
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
that same reasoning suppose that I go to
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
the police and I say I think you've
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
stolen money from me I'm just using you
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
you know as obviously I I'm just using
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
this as an example or you go to the
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
police and you say I think Lynn has
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
stolen money from me should the police
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
have to tell me should the police before
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
they talk to you should I be have a
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
right to be present
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
so while while you're talking to the
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
police about you the fact that you think
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
I committed a crime because if you if I
 
00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:53.459 align:start position:0%
have the right to be present there's
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
going to be first of all you're probably
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
not going to go to the police or at
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
least you may not because you might be
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
afraid of me and secondly
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
if the police you know I'm I'm gonna if
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
I know about this from the beginning I'm
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
going to be in a position to maybe do
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
things to
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know to sort of Squatch the
 
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
investigation and so I mean that's kind
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
of my concern here
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
there are laws against that you know
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
doing things to intimidate Witnesses and
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
I have been in a situation where I've
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
had to ask police for some help and and
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
it was difficult when they went to the
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
person who perpetrated the crime and
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
asked them for their side of the story
 
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
which fair enough that's what they have
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
to do to investigate that's that's life
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
there are tough things that we have to
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
go through I'm sorry that's just the way
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
it is if you have
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
enough of a concern to bring this to the
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
pro appropriate person
 
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
with a crime or some kind of a problem
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's happening in your in your
 
00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.509 align:start position:0%
that's happening in your in your
community

00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
then you just have to be tough enough to
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
also back up what you're saying with
 
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
some evidence and if you can't then it's
 
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:08.420 align:start position:0%
not going to go anywhere
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
and just I would just say if you have
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
that concern then you have to just be
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
able to to
 
00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure that that really
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
answers the question of whether or not
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
of why
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
the person who
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
is being investigated should be able to
 
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
know about the investigation
 
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
right from the beginning
 
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:37.139 align:start position:0%
because if that but how do you get to
 
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
that point how do you get to the point
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
that you're discussing it as a board
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
you have to have something that brings
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
you to that point and that would be the
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
beginning the beginning was before that
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning isn't
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
suppose that
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's a selectman's meeting tonight
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm one of the selector
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
and it's at three o'clock this afternoon
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
some Town employee comes to me and says
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
I've got information to suggest that the
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:18.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:18.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
tonight at the selectments meeting
 
00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.710 align:start position:0%
tonight at the selectments meeting
tonight

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
can I tell the other Selectmen about
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
this and if I do do I have to notify the
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
clerk why we're going to talk about the
 
00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
fact that somebody is alleged you've
 
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
stolen money that doesn't give you the
 
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:34.700 align:start position:0%
48 hours that this bill
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
requires it doesn't give you the 48
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
hours to notify the person that you're
 
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
talking about who you think has
 
00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
talking about who you think has
um

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.689 align:start position:0%
um
embezzled

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
embezzled
 
00:14:44.699 --> 00:14:47.449 align:start position:0%
embezzled
yeah

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
if you get that information I think the
 
00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
first thing you're going to say well
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
I need some evidence of this before I
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
bring it bring it to the council I need
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
evidence you can't just
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
say I think
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn is stealing money
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
you have to say well give me the
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
evidence of that and once you have the
 
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
evidence and it's appropriate then to
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
bring it to a
 
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.670 align:start position:0%
bring it to a
meeting

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
then the person could be just like the
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
police have to have the evidence before
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
they go after somebody I think what this
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
is going to do it's going to stop
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
I don't like that representative so I'm
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to say that she did this or that
 
00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:41.339 align:start position:0%
that's what it's going to stop because
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
too much of that goes on too much
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
accusing people of thing goes on
 
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.150 align:start position:0%
accusing people of thing goes on
and

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
um and I think this will stop it if they
 
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
know that when it's talked about whether
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
it be at the Town level or the state
 
00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.210 align:start position:0%
it be at the Town level or the state
level

00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
that they're going to allow to be
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
present to defend themselves
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
we do that here in the State House when
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
an accusation is made against you you're
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
there you're it when it's discussed
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
you're there this was put before you
 
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
yeah my concern is really I think
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
that the the the if I got that
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
information as a selectman I would have
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
to you know I would say I need more and
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with you I would be
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
saying that but this but this would say
 
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
that I can't discuss it
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
I can't discuss the fact that employee X
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
came to me with this information I can't
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
tell the other
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
the other uh Selectmen at a select
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
boards meeting in a private session that
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
I've gotten this information and say
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
look and say look you know I don't know
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
whether this is true or not I've asked
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
the person to get more to give me the
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
the the details but
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
this would seem to say that that I can't
 
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
do that without letting the person know
 
00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
that they're being investigated in other
 
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
words the the problem is there's there's
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
no question that at some point somebody
 
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
who's being accused of something if
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
there's really something there sure
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
they've got to be notified they've got
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
to have an opportunity to be heard I
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
mean I don't disagree with that at all
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
but the problem is
 
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.530 align:start position:0%
but the problem is
at

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
during the time when there's an
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
investigation going on
 
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.909 align:start position:0%
investigation going on
they

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
they I mean they shouldn't know that
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
they're being empowered they may not it
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
may not be appropriate for them to know
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
that they're being investigated because
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
then they can take steps that would be
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
might undercut the investigation that's
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps you should gather more evidence
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
before you get to that point where
 
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:02.780 align:start position:0%
you're discussing it with with others
 
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
with others
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's the best way to move
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
forward with such a thing
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
we had more evidence before it was
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
discussed with us
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
there was evidence before it came to us
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
and and like I said if that person that
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
we were talking about was there I would
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
have been happy to get there
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
explanation of it if they wanted to give
 
00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:41.810 align:start position:0%
explanation of it if they wanted to give
it

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
I felt like that often when we discussed
 
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.570 align:start position:0%
I felt like that often when we discussed
employees

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
that if there was any problem I would
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
really like to hear from from them and
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
again the municipal Association
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative suggested that one of the
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
I mean we might be able to
 
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.710 align:start position:0%
I mean we might be able to
um

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
we might be able to at least somewhat
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
cure the issue by
 
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.970 align:start position:0%
cure the issue by
um

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
amending section A of subsection two to
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
not only include that that's the section
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
that says where you can be a non-public
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
session to discuss the dismissal
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
promotion or compensation of an employee
 
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
or the investigation of any charges
 
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
against him or her
 
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
He suggests
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
changing that to include not only
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
employees but also officials
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the jurisdiction
 
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.549 align:start position:0%
of the jurisdiction
um

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.430 align:start position:0%
so that
um

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
if you if you
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
amended that to include
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know to include not just employees
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
but officials of the jurisdiction
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
um then that would then in the situation
 
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.690 align:start position:0%
um then that would then in the situation
where

00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
that there's the the in the example I
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
gave you could withhold disclosure to
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
the to the person that's sort of that's
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term the target of
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
the investigation pursuant to that
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
section so
 
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.150 align:start position:0%
section so
um

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
I mean what if we did that and then made
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
the Chan and then left
 
00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
the Chan and then left
C

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
C
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
as you propose it perhaps with the
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
limitation of the residence requirement
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
what would you say about that
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
can you go over that again
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
right but that was yeah just go through
 
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
it again so a so subsection a of the law
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
as it now exists says that you can be in
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
non-public session
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
for the following reason
 
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.610 align:start position:0%
for the following reason
um

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
to discuss quote the dismissal promotion
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
or compensation of any Public Employee
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
or the disciplining of such employee or
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
the investigation of any charges against
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
him or her
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
unless the employee one has the right to
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
a meeting and two requests that the
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
meeting be open in which case the
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
request shall be granted well an
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't have a right to a
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
meeting if you're talking about
 
00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:18.299 align:start position:0%
investigating you're you're talking
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
you're just talking about investigating
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
the employee if you're gonna if you're
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
going to fire you if you're going to
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
take some action against them maybe they
 
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
do but if you're just going to
 
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
investigate them they don't have any
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
right to a meeting so what
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
um what Natchez suggested was what if we
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
amend that section right now it applies
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
only to employees what if we change what
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
if we mended it so that it would also
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
apply to officials meaning like planning
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
board like a town clerk or the planning
 
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
board member or Zoning Board member the
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
town selectman that kind of thing how
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
about the public
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
um what about the public because the
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
public gets drawn in very often to
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
incriminating things during not in
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
public as well
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
I don't really have a problem with an
 
00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
official but the the original
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
reason for why this was of interest to
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
me was I got drawn into something and I
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
was not it was not in my role as a state
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative it was in
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
I was just a member of the public in
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
that role where I spoke to a library
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
director in my community and
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
there was an investigation on whether or
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
not I had
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
influenced well the other person that
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
spoke to the library director at that
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
time there was an investigation about
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
that person who's here with us today and
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not that person
 
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.049 align:start position:0%
whether or not that person
um

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:47.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
bullied the library director into
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
canceling a program which did not happen
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
the investigation showed that that did
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
not happen and that would have been good
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
for the town counselors to know that and
 
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
to hear from that person
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
who was
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
a library trustee at that time at that
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
library and had every right to talk to
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
the director about a program
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
but of course not violate any state laws
 
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.850 align:start position:0%
but of course not violate any state laws
about

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:15.860 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
bullying them or anything or influencing
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
them to do something that they they
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
didn't have the right to do and that's
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
not what happened the the that was the
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
investigation found that to not be true
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
it would have been a great Savings of
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
money in taxpayer funds to my community
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
to for the Town Council to have heard
 
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
from that person
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
um when that happened
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
so yes official would
 
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything that they
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
and can you just identify yourself
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
please I'm Lorraine lindenberg from
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
Derry yes
 
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:06.740 align:start position:0%
um the attention of HB 652 was not for
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh employees
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
because there already is under 91 A3
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
C2 all right for employees of the town
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:27.539 align:start position:0%
you know so the example that was used by
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
the nhama
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
was already in this bill
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
it's already in in law under the what
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
these uh well no it's not because a
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
applies only to employees an employee
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
would not include somebody like a like a
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
planning board member or the selectman
 
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.149 align:start position:0%
planning board member or the selectman
or

00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
um or town clerk or that well the town
 
00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:02.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
they're elected officials but they're
 
00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:08.059 align:start position:0%
also you know paid employees
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh but that example is already is
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
already in the law
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
the HB 652 was for basically private
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
citizens who may be accused of something
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
um and the council goes into not public
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
I believe that you know a private
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
citizen should be notified and allowed
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
to attend to be able to speak on their
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
own behalf
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
and there is no uh law in 91a that does
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
provide this mandatory can I just ask
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
you a
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
what I'm
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
I'm really concerned about is this
 
00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:51.299 align:start position:0%
I certainly agree
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.529 --> 00:25:59.539 align:start position:0%
you know if if the town is going to take
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
some action against somebody in other
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I'm I'm sure I'm not
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the details of the
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
situation example if for example if the
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
town we're going to say some person is
 
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
going to be barred from entering the
 
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
library or bards from entering a school
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
or uh where you know we're gonna We're
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
Not Gonna uh
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh contract with that person anymore or
 
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:30.860 align:start position:0%
whatever I certainly think that before
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
the town should could do that they would
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
the the person has a right to be heard
 
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
and to put on a defense
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't happen representative
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
Lynn unfortunately will you live in a
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
small town too unfortunately that
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen and what happens is in a
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
circumstance like this I didn't know
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
about that circumstance but there are
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances that happen that you know
 
00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:00.059 align:start position:0%
a people are human they unfortunately
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
private citizens who live in a community
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
need something to protect them too
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
because not all Town officials like all
 
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
the citizens and the problem that you
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
can run into I mean I know very well
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
that my Town Council chair does not like
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
me and he's very obvious about it and
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
has done some really different difficult
 
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.370 align:start position:0%
has done some really different difficult
things

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
the private citizen should have a right
 
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
to be able to be present if the council
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
members are talking about them because
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
someone said well uh Christine did this
 
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059 align:start position:0%
or Christine did that and we need to see
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do about it I think
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
the private citizen has a right to
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
to be there to say well that's not
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
really what happened you know that and I
 
00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
have this person that was with me that
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
can tell you that's not what happened so
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
it's about due process being able to
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
hear what what you're being accused of
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
and being able to speak on your own
 
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.730 align:start position:0%
and being able to speak on your own
behalf

00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
were you informed that they were going
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
to be talking about you
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
I was not informed and I found out
 
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
afterwards there was an investigation
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
when I got a phone call from a lawyer
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
when I was out of state taking care of
 
00:28:20.169 --> 00:28:20.179 align:start position:0%
some really important family business
 
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't really
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
give it the attention that I it deserved
 
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.610 align:start position:0%
give it the attention that I it deserved
um

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
all I could do was tell that lawyer
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
please read all of the library trustee
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes and review when I spoke
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
to the Town Council about this issue
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and what I think happened was one
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
town counselor probably went and told
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
the others what
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
happened at a library trustees meeting
 
00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
what allegedly happened alleged what
 
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:53.659 align:start position:0%
what they thought happened
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
they gave their story about what
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
happened at a library trustees meeting
 
00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.470 align:start position:0%
happened at a library trustees meeting
um

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.029 align:start position:0%
um
when

00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
the other Town counselors were not at
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
that meeting I don't think the minutes
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
were out yet and I I know Town
 
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
counselors are very busy and can't read
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
every single solitary thing that happens
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
in the community and may have just
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
assumed that this perspective that was
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
presented to them was the only one when
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
I found it to be quite inaccurate
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
to say the least it appears to me if you
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
the first sentence in subsection C
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
address switch if discussed in public
 
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:39.539 align:start position:0%
would likely affect adversely the
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
reputation of any person other than a
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
member of the public body themself
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
unless such person requests an open
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
meeting it would seem that
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
there would have to be some knowledge by
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
the person who's being discussed
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
well that's
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm talking about the uh if
 
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.710 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm talking about the uh if
the

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
public body is going to go into
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
non-public to discuss someone it appears
 
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.769 align:start position:0%
non-public to discuss someone it appears
that

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh if the person is being discussed
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
this person that's being discussed has
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
to know about it otherwise they would
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
never have an opportunity to request an
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
you know so it it seems that what
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
happened here is the the Town Council
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
aired in conducting the uh
 
00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:38.990 align:start position:0%
aired in conducting the uh
uh

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
non-public meeting because if they're
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about you they
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
should have given you an opportunity to
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
request an open meeting right but that
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
that pertains to employees public
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
employees and I agree with the nhma that
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
um you could add officials to that
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
subsection but HB 652 is more for
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
private citizens not for public
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
employees since there already is a law
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
and they do have the right to uh to a
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
meeting and to decide whether it should
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh meeting or in public meeting they
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
have a right to decide but a private
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
citizen uh does not
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have the right to a hearing
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
at all a meeting at all
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
and and just as the spirit of that law
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
is to protect the the career and the
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
reputation of public employees I think
 
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.549 align:start position:0%
reputation of public employees I think
that

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
regular citizens deserve the same
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity I feel I felt afterwards
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
like the situation that caused me to be
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
interested in this was based on lies
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
that I had no way of rebutting at that
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
at that time that's how I felt about it
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
that that it had to have been presented
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
inaccurately in order for the other Town
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
counselors to have voted to have an
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
investigation which was utterly
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and a waste of taxpayer
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
funds so you know I guess here here's
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
the thing that I'm I'm trying to sort of
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
think through this because I think in
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
some sense we're talking about
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
at least somewhat different things yes
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
right the
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
before I don't have any questions I said
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
a moment ago I don't have any question
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
that before some adverse action
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
should be taken against somebody
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
you know the examples I gave the first
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
obviously the person needs
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
to it needs to have an opportunity to
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
for due process to be able to you know
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.010 align:start position:0%
to to
um

00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.450 align:start position:0%
um
respond

00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.730 align:start position:0%
respond
but

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
the thing I'm not I I think I disagree
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
with is when you say for example when
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
you said representative O'Brien vet
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
they you you had the right to know
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
before that they were gonna do an
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
investigation or before they did an
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
investigation why why should you know
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
that in other words why is it any
 
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.169 align:start position:0%
that in other words why is it any
different

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
than supposed that instead of going to
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
the selectments for the selectment to
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
discuss this whoever had this complaint
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
went to the police
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
do you have a right to know before the
 
00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
police do it take any you know before
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
they arrest you or take any action that
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
you're being investigated because that
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
would be a really a major difference
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
from existing law
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
as I as I previously spoke up
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's part of the investigation is to
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
speak to all sides and that's what the
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
police do when they do those sorts of
 
00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
Investigations about serious crimes sure
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
but they don't in other words but if if
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
somebody accused accused me of robbery
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
for example the police they may decide
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
to speak to me but they don't do that
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they don't tell me that at the
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
outset they go gather the evidence
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
just you know to see if they've got a
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
case and usually the the last person
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
that gets talked to is the person that's
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
the that's the um that is Accused
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
because the police try to gather the
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
information from other people first and
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
they may have that information but
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
speaking to you may be very important to
 
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
that investigation you may be able to
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
say something of very high importance
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
such as I was not even in town I was not
 
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
even in the state when that robbery
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
occurred exactly but but but the problem
 
00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:49.849 align:start position:0%
occurred exactly but but but the problem
is

00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
the analogy that I'm drawing is you
 
00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
would say that the police have to when
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
Once when somebody comes into the police
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
and says Lynn stole some money from me
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
the first thing the police have to say
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
wait a minute stop we can't really talk
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
to you right now we have to call Lynn
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
and tell him that you're complaining
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
against him that's sort of the
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
equivalent for the selectman's meeting
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about and that's the
 
00:35:17.569 --> 00:35:17.579 align:start position:0%
thing that I have some problem with
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
because it seems to
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
it seems to it the implications of that
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
I think could be
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
could be pretty significant do you feel
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
the same way about
 
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.690 align:start position:0%
the same way about
about

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:31.700 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
speaking to employees and having
 
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.930 align:start position:0%
speaking to employees and having
employees

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
present when there there's going to be a
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
hearing about them do you feel that
 
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
because that is in in law right now and
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
would you would you do you think that
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
should not exist
 
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.550 align:start position:0%
should not exist
no

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
but whether it's not it is not the law
 
00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:54.109 align:start position:0%
but whether it's not it is not the law
now

00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
that if you're going if the if the
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
Selectmen are going to be talking
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
about an employee not taking any action
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
but just in other words
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
talking about an employee that they have
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
to notify the employer I'm not aware of
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
anything in the law that says they but
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's the case why don't you make it
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
before any action any any
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
is taken that might
 
00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:23.339 align:start position:0%
against the person or that might blah
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.050 align:start position:0%
 
reputation

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
reputation
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
what about if you had it say add the
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
officials that's fine
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
Ed is a resident of the jurisdiction of
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
the municipality
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
but in instead of have it say that
 
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.970 align:start position:0%
but in instead of have it say that
before

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:48.980 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
any action is taken like before they
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
called a lawyer before they did that
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
before any type of action that would
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
directly and I don't know the legal
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
terms you guys do that all the time to
 
00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:04.190 align:start position:0%
terms you guys do that all the time to
me

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
that would uh
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
have any possibility of being taken
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
against the public the citizen
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
or that would in any way you know do
 
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:19.940 align:start position:0%
something about their um
 
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
you know their reputation
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
because public sessions if I'm in a
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
public non-public session and I'm a
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
council meeting I'm not supposed to go
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
out and say hey guess what I heard I
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
heard the general right okay right I
 
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
agree so if it's in a non-public session
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to keep their mouth
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
shut about it but before they take any
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
action of any type whether it be
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
criminal or non-criminal or would just
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
do something to their reputation that
 
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
then the person has the right
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
to a meeting to a meeting I think that's
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
fair okay that sound all right so let me
 
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.050 align:start position:0%
fair okay that sound all right so let me
announce

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:02.060 align:start position:0%
announce
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that's fair too that
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me the only question is
 
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.630 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me the only question is
where

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
proposing some language yes I see
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
somebody in the back that has
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
come on up okay and somehow yeah you
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
don't don't leave you you may have
 
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
something to respond but
 
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.770 align:start position:0%
something to respond but
um

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:20.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
the other thing you're going to have to
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
include the public in this the public
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
isn't included in this
 
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:42.910 align:start position:0%
isn't included in this
foreign

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
I am general counsel for the office of
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
professional licensor and certification
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
and we oversee I think 180 000
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
individual licensees in the state with
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
around 200 000 different license types
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
so we're very much interested in the
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
outcome of this bill with me is attorney
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
Ricky and medley and she is sort of my
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
Counterpoint she or counterpart she uh
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
provides advice to the professional
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
boards that the office oversees it's an
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
interesting where this conversation
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
turned because the whole time we're
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
having this conversation I'm thinking a
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
lot of the opportunities to be heard are
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
covered they're just not covered under
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
91a they're covered under 541a the
 
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure act at least
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
the state level so I pulled up the
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
definition in 541a one an agency uh
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two agency means each
 
00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:39.500 align:start position:0%
state board commission Department
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
institution officer or any other state
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
official or group other than the
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
legislature or the courts authorized by
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
law to make rules or to determine
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
contested cases and what it sounds like
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
based on this conversation is that
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're interested in expanding now I
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
haven't done any kind of legal analysis
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
to see if that definition would apply at
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
the municipality level but it sounds
 
00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:07.579 align:start position:0%
like that's what we're talking about is
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
expanding 541a the administrative
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
procedure act to apply at the local
 
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.870 align:start position:0%
procedure act to apply at the local
level

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.130 align:start position:0%
level
and

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
I I don't think 91a is the appropriate
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
statute for for what we're trying to do
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
based on the conversation I've heard and
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
I also think the language has written
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of a lot of problems and
 
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.569 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of a lot of problems and
um

00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
for for the way things function at the
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
state level right now and I can give you
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
some examples if you'd like them some of
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
them you've actually already talked
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
about today so when I'm when I'm hearing
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
the conversation I thought maybe
 
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
maybe we're looking at the long wrong
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
law in order to try and solve this
 
00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.870 align:start position:0%
law in order to try and solve this
problem

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
throw 541a or something similar in the
 
00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.930 align:start position:0%
throw 541a or something similar in the
mix

00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
mix
 
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
now I don't know if I made any friends
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
with the municipalities did I come up
 
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
and saying that but I wanted to put it
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
right well what I mean what would if if
 
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
we made the changes that representative
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
Perez has suggested why I think I think
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
the changes still make the law
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
too expansive and I'll give you a couple
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
of reasons why and I also submitted some
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
testimony back in March when we were
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill I can I can send that
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
again no I think I I think we well I I
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
think I have okay I had it at home on my
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
kitchen counter it's a good read if you
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
need to go to sleep
 
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.750 align:start position:0%
need to go to sleep
um

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
so we've got a couple of issues one of
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
them is emergency hearings under the
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
lplc statutes three ten twelve four uh
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
also I believe 541 a where's the
 
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
emergency oh it's in my other work it's
 
00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:04.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
541-a colon 30 Roman numeral three and
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
what that covers is
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
um emergency hearings when an individual
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
has been identified as a an immediate
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
threat to the public a complaint comes
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
in the office learns about something the
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
board learns about something they can do
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
a hearing ex parte and suspend a license
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
that day and then they have to hold a
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing to see if that license or that
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
suspension should be upheld within 10
 
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.089 align:start position:0%
suspension should be upheld within 10
days

00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think the language has
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
proposed would account for that type of
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
thing at all the initiation of
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
additional disciplinary proceeding and
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
you've sort of talked about this a lot
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative but I do want to say sort
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the way our process works a complaint
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
comes in we check to see if there's a
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
claim the investigators go out and
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
investigate they put together a
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation to proceed or not then
 
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's brought before the board and I
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
suppose a good equivalent would be sort
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
of a grand jury indictment and so I
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
think the way the language as proposed
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
is written it would be like having the
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
individual under investigation sitting
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
in on that grand jury deliberation and I
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
the system is going to be able to
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
function that way
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
also the language as written after the
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
public hearing because there is still
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
notice and opportunity to be heard if
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
the state is going to take action
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
against the individual the licensee
 
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.030 align:start position:0%
against the individual the licensee
whomever

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
whomever
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
that notice and opportunity isn't in 91a
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
it's in 541a it's that administrative
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
procedure act I have a question sure
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the public we're not
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
talking about people who work
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
credentials we're talking right but the
 
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
language in as proposed would expand
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
any person could be somebody could be
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
one of those people it would also
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
because we are subject to 91a so it
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
would if we if we expand that language
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have to follow it
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh administrative procedure act aside
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
so it's going to touch on the licensees
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to touch on the systems in
 
00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:17.060 align:start position:0%
place now let me make a comment sure
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's predicted except for the
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
except for the private citizen that's
 
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.390 align:start position:0%
except for the private citizen that's
something

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
I I just the private citizen
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
I I we need to protect the private
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
citizen from false accusations by towns
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
by people by this and that right now
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're not protecting them
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
a private citizen and the way of the
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
world is getting worse and worse you
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
know I have said many times sitting here
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
I understand that's protecting that's
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
protecting the municipality and all the
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
people that work for it but it's not
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
protecting the people who are living in
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
the town who it's protecting them it's
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
not protecting me as a private citizen
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
living in a town I want protection under
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
91a that I'm not going to be falsely
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
accused of something because
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien doesn't like me
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I want that protection this
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
is a way to give me that protection
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
and I understand it may but what about
 
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
the person if you they're I'm sure
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
they're tired of hearing me say that
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
what about what about the layperson what
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
well I don't necessarily disagree with
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
that I'm just I just don't think that
 
00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:39.500 align:start position:0%
this language is
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily the best path forward to to
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
get those Protections in place without
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
blowing up at least at the state level
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
the processes that are already in place
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
because of 541a and that's why I came up
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
initially I think maybe something
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
similar to the administrative procedure
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
act would be a better fit for the
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
problem we're trying to solve than a
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
modification to 91a which is going to
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
touch the municipalities but it's also
 
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:09.380 align:start position:0%
going to touch all of the state agencies
 
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
and and really bring a lot of good
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
processes including due process notice
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard to their knees
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
right this this could it's not an
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
exaggeration to say this could really be
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
devastating to the way the state is
 
00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
operating now if we want to expand that
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
to the municipality level you know I I
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
can't take a position on that as a as a
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
member of the executive branch but I do
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
think something more along the lines of
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
the administrative procedure act would
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
would get you where you wanted to be so
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
you can put a private citizen in there I
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
mean you can make it covered so a
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
private citizen would be covered under
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
to get due process and that's the
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
conversation we can have but if you and
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just brainstorming here right I'm
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
this is based on the conversation we
 
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
heard today but what if you expanded I'm
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
not making friends here right now I know
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
um agency if you expanded that to
 
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.130 align:start position:0%
um agency if you expanded that to
include

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
a municipality or government at any
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
level in the state then the notice and
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity be heard the time limits for
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
taking action on applications all of
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
those things would
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
by nature of including them in the
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
definition be expanded to the local
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
levels and it would give that private
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
citizen if the local level agency was
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to take action against them it
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
would expand
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
and give them those protections I
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but again
 
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer I was a nurse for 42
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
years I don't think that's Apples to
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
Apples I think that's apples to oranges
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
that's just my first impression I would
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
have to do more research on it but
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
well all right so you know what um
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
what if uh I'm you know I I think your
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
point is a good one about your the take
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
the the issue I'm having is just is just
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
exactly how to word it so that it
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
accomplishes what you what you uh have
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.510 align:start position:0%
in mind
um

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
but um if we in other words if we did if
 
00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.650 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a3 Roman numeral 2C if we change
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
you have you have to give notice to the
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
person who's being
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
talked about before some action not just
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
simply because they're being talked
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
about but before some action
 
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
is taken against them
 
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.349 align:start position:0%
is taken against them
um

00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:59.930 --> 00:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
what are you recommending maybe taking
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
some of the provisions of 41A that apply
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
to the state and then bringing them to
 
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
91a at the municipality level
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
because that sort of sounds right like
 
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.849 align:start position:0%
because that sort of sounds right like
like

00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
the way the system works now you've got
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
that system analogous to a grand jury
 
00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:17.510 align:start position:0%
that system analogous to a grand jury
indictment

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
indictment
 
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.370 align:start position:0%
indictment
um

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
well this there is there's notice an
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard there at the
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
state level and I'm talking about the
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
state level why can't you add unless
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
life limit something you know you know
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
unless they're going to kill somebody
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
well I also think the language it opens
 
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.490 align:start position:0%
well I also think the language it opens
up

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
deliberations after uh notice and
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity and a hearing have occurred
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
those boards can sit there and delivery
 
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
I I read the language as proposed to be
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
expansive to allow the individual in the
 
00:49:51.599 --> 00:49:52.670 align:start position:0%
expansive to allow the individual in the
room

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's ex parte communication issues
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
there because hearing Council wouldn't
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
necessarily the person who prosecuted
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
the case wouldn't necessarily be able to
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
be in the room
 
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and then also I mean even with with
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
processing licensing applications if
 
00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
somebody has a criminal background check
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
and the board has to review that too and
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're making a determination that
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
could be in non-public depending on the
 
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:21.140 align:start position:0%
crime the accusation whatever it may be
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
essentially if if we let that person in
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
the room we're we're kind of creating
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
situations where they've become
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
contested cases without giving proper
 
00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.220 align:start position:0%
notice to the other side state agency
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
based on 541a
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
so so I
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
I just we need to be very careful about
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
what we do with 91a because we're trying
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
to solve what it what I'm hearing is
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
problems at the local level but the
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
language as proposed is going to impact
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
but we're talking but that's what we're
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
trying to do we're trying to think right
 
00:50:58.859 --> 00:50:59.750 align:start position:0%
trying to do we're trying to think right
the

00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
John Doe who lives in
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
a town of 50 people that's who that's
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
who we're here to protect right okay and
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with the fact that you
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
background check that's part of the
 
00:51:17.579 --> 00:51:18.770 align:start position:0%
background check that's part of the
investigation

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
that you would have before you took
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
action I'm saying before you take action
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
you can gather all the information you
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
want I'm saying have it before action
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
before you hire a lawyer to go against
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
them or prosecute them or before you
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
kick them out of the Town out of you
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
know say they can't go near the library
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
or before you tell them they can't come
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
walking into the building I mean due
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
process is not followed all the time we
 
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
had private citizen two private citizens
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
that were not allowed on Tom property
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible horrible incident in
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
our town that's
 
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know I mean
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
but we've got to protect the private
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
citizen and I understand the credentials
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
and stuff but you can do all the
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
investigation you want all I'm asking is
 
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
that once you've done that investigation
 
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
before you decide to prosecute or not do
 
00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:16.220 align:start position:0%
anything or or whatever you decide to do
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
that person has a right even if you're
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything the person
 
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
should have a right to come in and say
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
hey we we got this complaint we're not
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
going to do we looked around we're not
 
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
going to do anything but what's your
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
a very motherhood in apple pie I'm I'm
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
for the you know
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
the private citizen needs to be
 
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.710 align:start position:0%
the private citizen needs to be
protected

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
protected
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
I happen to be one with a big mouth so I
 
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.849 align:start position:0%
I happen to be one with a big mouth so I
know

00:52:42.849 --> 00:52:42.859 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
well my response to that would be at
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
least at the state level I think that
 
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
private citizen does have those
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
protections with the notice and
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard I can't speak at
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
the municipal level
 
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:57.059 align:start position:0%
and but that's again why I keep bringing
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
up 541a administrative procedure act I
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
to me that's more the solution than a
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
all right privacy can I can I ask a
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
question of you representative Perez so
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting is that uh
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
before anyone be discussed
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
in a non-public meeting that you make a
 
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
public notice saying that they're going
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
to be discussed that's not what I'm
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
saying yes it appears to be no what I'm
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
you two are the council members and and
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
O'Brien I have a complaint
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative Perez because she did
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
this this and this and I think she's
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
doing this this and this okay so now you
 
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
council members get together you discuss
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
it you look into it you you know gather
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
the information you want to you come to
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
a decision that we're either going to
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
say this is baloney and we're not going
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
to do anything or we're going to say gee
 
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
we need to tell her she can't come to
 
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
Town Council meetings anymore or this
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
that at that point before you do
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
whatever you have decided to do you call
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
me in private citizen Perez to come and
 
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:18.410 align:start position:0%
me in private citizen Perez to come and
say

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
private citizen O'Brien did this this
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
and this and this this is what we have
 
00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.870 align:start position:0%
and this and this this is what we have
found

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
is that what you're looking for
 
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
yeah right but you but you see I I mean
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
I I think the problem here is this
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
because it really
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
nine remember 91a is simply a disclosure
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it's not it it's the
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
disclosure law it doesn't have anything
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
to do with the law of when you can take
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
action or not it's just a disclosure law
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's and so
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
this I mean I agree with you I I the
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
scenario you just pointed out I agree
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
with you completely but I think what
 
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
it to use your scenario the proposed
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that's that that uh I mean the
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment accomplished by
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
652 it would say
 
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.069 align:start position:0%
652 it would say
that

00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.630 align:start position:0%
that
when

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
if we're the board of Selectmen and
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to come in and say
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Perez did something wrong
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
but leave the representative out of it
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay somebody's going to come in and say
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
Ms Perez a citizen of Londonderry did
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
something wrong
 
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
what this amendment would say is
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
we can't even have that discussion oh
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
let's make it let's modify it so that it
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
have the discussion but before we take
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
any action against
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
right right exactly right but I guess
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
what I think what I'm saying is this law
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't say now that they can take
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
action without telling there's nothing
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
in this law that says the way it is the
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
way it's written right now that says
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
they can take some action against
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
citizen Perez
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
without without giving her due process
 
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
yeah that's this is just a question of
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
of can they have a discussion in a
 
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
non-public session before they can take
 
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know before they can take action
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
against you they can't if they were
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
going to say you're barred from going
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
into the library or you know they they
 
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
can't do that without giving you some
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
some due process I mean that would seem
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
to me that's probably unconstitutional
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
well it happens all the time
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
see them not in their heads it happens
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
every single day
 
00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
every single day they do that what kind
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
of things happen What kinds of things
 
00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.910 align:start position:0%
of things happen What kinds of things
happen

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
I just explained one I uh you can't come
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
on Town property
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
two could you elaborate on that a little
 
00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
it had nothing to do with me but it's a
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
court case
 
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.750 align:start position:0%
court case
um

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
so I probably should but I mean
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of things that happen
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
you know where you go to public session
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
and if the if if
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
you can talk for three minutes but it's
 
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
allowed for five of we're done we don't
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
want to hear that stuff happens all the
 
00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
time all the time
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
are you agreeing with me that it's
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
really sad what goes on
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
in the name of being a whatever in a
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
town it's very very sad to me what goes
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
on and
 
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.410 align:start position:0%
on and
um

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
I I just think people have a right to be
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's just it it's I just
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
think people have a right to know what
 
00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
groups Municipal groups
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
town councils or this group or the
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
planning board or this port are saying
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
against them
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
because John Doe said it and have no
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
right to be able to say blah blah blah
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
you know I mean I'm going to a meeting
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
tomorrow night then I know they're not
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to be happy about but they want to
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
put 96 homes on dirty land but just
 
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
don't eat the dirt or drink the brown
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
Water really
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they're going to tell me I
 
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
can't talk anymore but
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about the kids that are
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
going to live in that area so I mean
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's very sad I worry about
 
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation a lot that's why all
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
right anyone else anything else anyone
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
wants to say
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh can I ask sure uh you rattled off a
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of numbers about uh the uh you
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
spoke faster than I could write I'm
 
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.849 align:start position:0%
spoke faster than I could write I'm
sorry

00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
it was five oh administrative procedure
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
Act is 541a
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and then colon one is the
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
definitions and Roman numeral two is
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
where agency is defined and then you
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
have to get more into the statue but uh
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
29 29a 30 they create the due process
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
they create the notices narrowed it a
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
little bit for me so that okay because
 
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
before it was this big and now it's this
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
big okay uh
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm also happy and unfortunately I can't
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to what happens at the
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
municipal level I don't work at the
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
um but I I do think that I do think the
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
language as proposed is going to have
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
real unintended consequences at the
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
state level where the due process is
 
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.490 align:start position:0%
state level where the due process is
happening

00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
sure do Town Charters supersede
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal law I'm not ready to answer
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
can I ask uh that's can you come up for
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
so can I'm just wondering if you could
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
tell us generally my impression and but
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
a municipality for example may be able
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
to go into non-public session to to have
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
a discussion about
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
something where where you know they're
 
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to talk about somebody in an
 
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.609 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
that does not mean and correct me if I'm
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
wrong that does not mean that they can
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
then decide we're going to take some
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
action against the person without
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
giving the person due process I mean is
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
that is that correct correct correct so
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
if they in other words if they have in
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
in the example that gave Horizon if they
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
if the selectman had a meeting and said
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
you know we think somebody's doing
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
something wrong in the library
 
01:01:10.809 --> 01:01:10.819 align:start position:0%
they may be able to have that discussion
 
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
without notifying the person that
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to have that discussion
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
correct but if they were then to decide
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to Bar
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
Ms X or Mr X from the library
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
can they do that without
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh giving the person an opportunity to
 
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.809 align:start position:0%
uh giving the person an opportunity to
respond

01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:37.609 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
possible because it's Town property and
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're the
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
governing body for the town so
 
01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:48.530 align:start position:0%
governing body for the town so
essentially

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
and let me give you let me give you a
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
couple different examples that might
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
help illustrate how this breaks out so
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
in your example with the library
 
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
you know if I go in the library and I
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
start throwing books around and you know
 
01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
acting like a crazy person
 
01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
I think it's possible for the governing
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
body to say
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know Nate you can't come in here
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
again but of course I can always
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
challenge that I can always either go in
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
there and then they'll be it court case
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
presumably for because they'll charge me
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
with trespass or I could simply go to
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
court and say they're illegally barring
 
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
me from this property
 
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.510 align:start position:0%
me from this property
um

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
to go back to something else that that
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
has been talked about extensively it
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
one of the kind of major points here is
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
that due process issue
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to emphasize
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
our position
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
um for that and let me go back to my
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
town clerk scenario so imagine I'm the
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
town clerk you have an employee comes in
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
and and you're the board and they say
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
hey nature is you know embezzling money
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
and what he's doing is some people are
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
coming in they're paying their car
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
registrations in cash and he's just
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
pocketing that
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I want to make
 
01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
sure is protected is something I think
 
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
that the the state does too although I
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
can't speak for them which is that you
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
know once you receive that accusation
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to discuss what to
 
01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
do as a board and come up with a plan
 
01:03:26.819 --> 01:03:29.210 align:start position:0%
do as a board and come up with a plan
and

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
whatever that plan is will probably
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
involve some sort of investigation and a
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
good investigator will probably come and
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
talk to me at some point in time to ask
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
my side of the story that's not required
 
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.349 align:start position:0%
my side of the story that's not required
by

01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
any existing law that's general practice
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
obviously if I'm actually embezzling
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
money the smart thing to do is deplete
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
the fifth but
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
as part of the investigation
 
01:03:55.319 --> 01:03:56.089 align:start position:0%
as part of the investigation
um

01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
I would potentially get to tell my side
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the story or it's possible the
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
investigation starts they interview the
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
employee they realize the employee is
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
not doing their job and they're mad at
 
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
me because I'm functioning effectively
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
as their boss and therefore there's no
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
credibility to this and they close the
 
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.010 align:start position:0%
credibility to this and they close the
investigation

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
so I think there are several different
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
scenarios that the language presented
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
here touch on
 
01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:27.020 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any objection to
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
clarifying anything around due process
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure that due process is
 
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
followed in scenarios where there where
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
some action is going to be taken I think
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate that's certainly
 
01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:39.740 align:start position:0%
required by the Constitution
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
and so I don't have any issues with any
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
sort of statutory changes that that may
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
clarify that process right but that
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
presumably that any changes in that
 
01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
regard would not be to the right to know
 
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
correct I mean it would be in some other
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
correct some other statute dealing with
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
what uh right when when this when a town
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
can take action against somebody and I
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
agree completely with your
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
characterization earlier of the right to
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
no law as a disclosure law of when
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
things are going to be disclosed versus
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
when they're not and and that
 
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.650 align:start position:0%
when they're not and and that
um

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
that summary that you gave of the law
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
can uh the the scenario to described
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
would be uh the the town has the
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
authority to Bar someone from the
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
library if since it is Tom property and
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
they might be doing something wrong but
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
the situation here is not
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
that it was uh attending a trustee
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
meeting which is a public meeting and
 
01:05:41.339 --> 01:05:42.530 align:start position:0%
meeting which is a public meeting and
speaking

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
now can they bar someone from a public
 
01:05:46.799 --> 01:05:50.630 align:start position:0%
now can they bar someone from a public
meeting

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
well you would have to analyze that
 
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:55.220 align:start position:0%
under the traditional public forum
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
analysis under the Constitution
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of any constitutional
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
cases where someone has been able to be
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
barred from a public forum
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
because that's the situation
 
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:15.950 align:start position:0%
because that's the situation
correct

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
well yes
 
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
well is it was that the situation that
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
we're we're discussing no oh
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
okay well then don't understand
 
01:06:26.819 --> 01:06:28.549 align:start position:0%
okay well then don't understand
correctly

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
good question do you know if charters
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
supersede the law
 
01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.390 align:start position:0%
supersede the law
because

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
very often we hear in different towns
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
saying well our chart Charter allows
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
that our Charter allows that our Charter
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
allows that
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
so let me give you an example
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
I live in a community and we have
 
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
Community rules okay and regulations
 
01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:52.849 align:start position:0%
Community rules okay and regulations
okay

01:06:52.849 --> 01:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
and then we have town
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
okay and then we have state I know that
 
01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
if we try to put something in here at
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
this level that is against what the town
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
says we can't it doesn't hold water I
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
want to see if a town puts a charter
 
01:07:10.859 --> 01:07:12.829 align:start position:0%
want to see if a town puts a charter
together

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
if that they can if I could turn around
 
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
say well that's against the law the
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
state law so therefore that doesn't hold
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
water so what I'm asking is can you have
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
things in your town chart or that don't
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
go follow the state law I would assume
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
the answer is no
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
you were Mr lawyer over there
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
we are not a home rule state the
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
legislature has allowed towns to adopt
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
Charters under uh chapter 43 BC and d
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
and they've allowed basically a limited
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
home rule and so there are certain
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
things that are required in those
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
Charters and certain things those
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
Charters may contain and those are all
 
01:07:59.529 --> 01:07:59.539 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the statutes thank you
 
01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:02.299 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else have anything
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
we've gone off on a lot in a lot of
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
directions here
 
01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.150 align:start position:0%
directions here
um

01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
and thinking about
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh what the gentleman from the office of
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
professional licensure was I think
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
that's is that correct
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
certification is was discussing uh if
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
you could
 
01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
add on onto onto this that that would
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
this would not apply to those procedures
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
would not apply to procedures defined in
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
our RSA 541a then it wouldn't affect
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
um profession professional licensure
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
administrative actions
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's a little cumbersome but I go back
 
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
to and I always like to go back to this
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
when I think about any issue how a
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
regular person would
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
interpret this law and find the laws
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
that Define their rights and I I go back
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
to when I was in my 20s and I was
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
working full-time and I had a little
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
baby and I was trying to find state laws
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
about about an issue that was very
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
important to me
 
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
it was very difficult for me I didn't
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
have training I remember I was working
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
full-time and I would be sitting at my
 
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.390 align:start position:0%
full-time and I would be sitting at my
bench

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
bench
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I made musical instruments at the
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
time and I ran a little machine shop and
 
01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
I thought I do not have 40 hours a week
 
01:09:32.329 --> 01:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
like the people in prison have to read
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
state law and I was very frustrated by
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
that and I would spend my evenings at
 
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
this at the library looking for
 
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:40.100 align:start position:0%
information and trying to find
 
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
definitions for things that I did not
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
know like habeas corpus how do I Define
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
that I was really frustrated by that I
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
just remember feeling very overwhelmed
 
01:09:49.679 --> 01:09:50.630 align:start position:0%
just remember feeling very overwhelmed
and

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
annoyed that any that whenever anything
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't easy to Define and easy to
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
understand I was annoyed and I was I was
 
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
mad I was mad about it
 
01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.990 align:start position:0%
mad I was mad about it
uh

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
I want to keep things as simple as
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
possible for the regular people of our
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
state to understand what their rights
 
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
are and everything that that
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative Perez was talking about
 
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
I agree wholeheartedly with with your
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
sentiments thank you for bringing that
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
forward and thinking about the regular
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
people of our state who sometimes feel
 
01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.149 align:start position:0%
people of our state who sometimes feel
short

01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
cited and forgotten about
 
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
and misunderstood and so busy with their
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
lives that they can't be here to discuss
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
just that I have found grin I'm new in
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
all of this and it's sometimes
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelming to me but the other thing
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
that I have found is that everybody else
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
has somebody representing them
 
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
but Joe John Doe does not have anybody
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
represented him and the the thing that
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
comes out all the time was well they can
 
01:10:59.930 --> 01:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
you know they can get a lawyer they can
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
get a lawyer
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
John Doe with two kids working full-time
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to get a lawyer
 
01:11:07.739 --> 01:11:09.169 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to get a lawyer
so

01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
let's not put it them in a position that
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
they have to fight for every single
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
thing and they understand what they're
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
I had to get a babysitter I had to get
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
my mother-in-law to help me watch my
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
kids sometimes so that I could go to the
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
library and look things up this was
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
before the internet but still it would
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
be the same thing now maybe I could do
 
01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
it while the baby was sleeping in the
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
other room I could maybe a little easier
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
now but still
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
not having a legal background trying to
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
understand things I felt overwhelmed and
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
it was hard and I wouldn't so I I want
 
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everything is easy to
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
understand for regular people who are
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
not lawyers I try to I try to think of
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
um so I guess
 
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
um so I guess
um

01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'll see I mean I'm I'm still very
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
you're Mike you're Mike's not as well
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.659 --> 01:12:14.689 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm still very troubled by this bill I
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
have to say honestly because I'm the
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
more I think about the implication
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
because what this bill seems to say is
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
and I think this would be a major change
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
have the right to know when a public
 
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.050 align:start position:0%
have the right to know when a public
body

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
in non-public sessions so it can't be
 
01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:41.300 align:start position:0%
disclosed it's not that they cannot
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
publish what they're doing to anybody
 
01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
but a member of the public has the right
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
to know when a public body is saying bad
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
things about them
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
even though they a can't disclose what
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
they're saying to anybody and B they
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
haven't taken any action any concrete
 
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
action in any way against the person
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
the implications of that seem to me to
 
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.250 align:start position:0%
the implications of that seem to me to
be

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
you know I I could see real problems
 
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
stemming from that if we were to say
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
that they do have that right
 
01:13:18.239 --> 01:13:19.550 align:start position:0%
that they do have that right
um

01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
um
yes

01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
HB 652 is modeled almost word for word
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts law
 
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
their right to know law I have a copy of
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
it yeah no no I understand that but I
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
think that Massachusetts is one of very
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
few states that have done this right I
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that I don't think there's
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere near in fact it may be the only
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
other state that's done it
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's not but that's the one
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
that I investigated
 
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
to make sure you know to see if there
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
was precedence
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
the 91a laws do protect public employees
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
but they don't protect private citizens
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
from being discussed in non-public
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
sessions without their knowledge you
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
know with without their knowledge
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
um you know and this is just 652 is
 
01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.510 align:start position:0%
um you know and this is just 652 is
simply

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
just to notify a private citizen
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh which was the individual
 
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
of this but not public meeting and that
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
they would be discussed now you're going
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
into non-public meeting uh under the
 
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
exceptions of you know there are several
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
exceptions and it's usually the
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
reputation exception
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
all right but what you want to do is
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
make sure that this person has the right
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
to hear what's being set against them
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
and the right to be able to speak on
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
right but but this said but you see
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's that that is the that is really
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
the problem of of this this is a
 
01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
disclosure law you are if we pass the
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
Bill even with all the suggestions that
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
we've changed that we've talked about if
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
you if you pass this bill
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
we're saying that they have a right
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
to know
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
even before they they have a right to
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
know simply because of the fact you're
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to discuss them whether there is
 
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
you know whether there is any
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
um something in other words in in if we
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
pass this this amendment as as drafted
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in and says
 
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
um they they go into non-public sessions
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
and somebody says one of the Selectmen
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
says you know uh
 
01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:56.780 align:start position:0%
um somebody told me that um
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
destroyed destroying some property in
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
the public park
 
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
and all the other selectmers say that
 
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
the person that told you that is crazy
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're not taking any further action end
 
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
of it they do they do nothing it's all
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
gone they they you know it it takes it
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
takes five minutes and nothing happens
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill the the per the
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
person would have the right to know
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
about the fact that they were having
 
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
when they would not be able to have that
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
discussion without calling the without
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
notifying the person and that's my
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
concern if there if there is no action
 
01:16:42.239 --> 01:16:44.270 align:start position:0%
concern if there if there is no action
taken

01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
why do you have the right to know
 
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
but how do you know that no accident is
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
going to be taken unless you bring it up
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
and I should have the right to be there
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
to hear what's being said about me you
 
01:16:59.770 --> 01:16:59.780 align:start position:0%
know because
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know why but let me ask you if
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
then why is it then why isn't it the
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
case if I if I suppose I'm you know
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm just making this example up
 
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
suppose that I think
 
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
that um the representative from the
 
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
municipal Association
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
um uh I I I say he assaulted me as we
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
were coming in here this morning
 
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I go to the police and I go so I I'm
 
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go down to the Concord
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
Police and I'm going to report him to
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
the Concord Police
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
does he have the right to be there
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's a police accident assault is a
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
police action not not a municipal board
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
so so you're going off into other
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
directions that have nothing to do with
 
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
91a no no no no but but if we if we pass
 
01:17:58.689 --> 01:17:58.699 align:start position:0%
this amounts suppose that
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
instead of instead of
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to the police about the about this
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
suppose it happens in the con suppose
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
instead of going to the police about
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
this is we're supposed we're this is the
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
this is the Windham select board and I
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
believe that that I was just assaulted
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
by uh by the the municipal Association
 
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative and I want to go into
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
non-public session to mention that that
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I intend to uh that we
 
01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:31.910 align:start position:0%
I'm you know I intend to uh that we
should

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
um that the select board should take
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
some action
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
all I'm talking about is discussing it
 
01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
not that they actually take the action
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
but simply discussing why do they why
 
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
does he have a right to be present for
 
01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:46.850 align:start position:0%
does he have a right to be present for
that

01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
I think we're going around in circles
 
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.630 align:start position:0%
I think we're going around in circles
and

01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
we need to get in if we got an amendment
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
on this where it would be the person
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
would be notified if an action was to be
 
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
taken that means there would be a
 
01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:02.219 align:start position:0%
meeting about this and then if an action
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
was taken to be taken and if you're
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
assaulted by someone wouldn't you just
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
why why not just go straight to the
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
police why would you stick around for a
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
meeting or something I mean you deal
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
with that and differently it wouldn't be
 
01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:17.300 align:start position:0%
a municipal board matter
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
I mean my problem is that the way this
 
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
is worded it would it it would it could
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
apply in that circumstance so that you
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to have well if you're
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
not taking an action
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
then if we put in get an amendment on
 
01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
this that that the person
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
has the right to a uh to know that
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to be discussing them
 
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
before an action is decided upon and
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
before any adverse action yeah then that
 
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
okay well how would you know there's
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
going to be an action taken before you
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
discuss it
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're not going to vote as a
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
board to investigate and spend Town
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
money on on a legal investigation hiring
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
a law firm that's an action that's taken
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
you don't need to I don't think you'd
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
need to to talk about the fact that
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have someone
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
investigated for assault because why
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
would you be talking about that on a
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
municipal board if it applied to say
 
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:18.770 align:start position:0%
municipal board if it applied to say
um

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:20.169 --> 01:20:20.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
their their job that might be part of it
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
if they were a police officer that
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
assaulted you or something I mean
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know where to go with that
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
that's just I think really getting into
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
the weeds
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
can I say something yeah sure what if we
 
01:20:36.010 --> 01:20:36.020 align:start position:0%
do in amendment that includes the
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
officials and we changed this that it
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
says the person has and I you do the
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
legal stuff the person has the right to
 
01:20:48.370 --> 01:20:48.380 align:start position:0%
notification prior to
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
any action being taken that means that
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
the poor the Town Council can get
 
01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:56.219 align:start position:0%
together and chit chat about it for as
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
long and as many times as they want to
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
do it but before we decide that we're
 
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
going to tell
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
Lynn that he can't go into the library
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
anymore we're going to call him in and
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
he has a right to
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
give his side of the story okay okay no
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
that that okay and I understand that the
 
01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.310 align:start position:0%
that that okay and I understand that the
municipal

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
people Administration people feel that
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's an issue if you want to try
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
try to put in it that it says something
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
that only applies to you know Town
 
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever but I still think we
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
need something that is going to give
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
John Doe the right to know what he's
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
been accused of before
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
the town takes any type of
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
