um thank you uh Mr chair I am happy to
 
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.210 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh Mr chair I am happy to
speak

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
um am not so in this section this uh
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
states that this is for supposed to be
 
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh and I think that
 
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
um we haven't uh I think heard from the
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
from the associations that they are
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
unable to train these people uh with the
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
funds that they are collecting and that
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
this is the only way that they can
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
achieve that
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
um because I think that there's other
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
ways of achieving like you know people
 
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
attending uh they could they could
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
require some nominal fee for for people
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
to to go to the trainings and and be
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
able to fund those trainings that way I
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
don't I don't necessarily know that they
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
need to um
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh increase the amount of funds going
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
through on memberships
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
um to discharge their duty of of
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
educating these public officials there's
 
00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
also the concern that
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
um in the statute there is a requirement
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
that each of the towns pay these dues to
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
these associations
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that increasing the amount of not
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
just one Association but all of these
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
associations for the potential up to
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars is
 
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
actually over doubling the um State
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
mandate that be expended on these
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
associations and you know as as it uh
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be an increase of of
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
unfended mandate from the state to the
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
order of maybe 100 or 150 dollars a town
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
and and not necessarily sure that all of
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
that money 100 of that money is going to
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
the education
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and not other other uh Avenues so for
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
those reasons I support the itl motion
 
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.750 align:start position:0%
those reasons I support the itl motion
foreign

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
would just like to note uh with respect
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
to this bill that we have had similar
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
bills that have similar amounts of
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
increases for similar activities and we
 
00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:24.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.169 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
um

00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:32.150 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
so this one the hearing we didn't really
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
get a chance to um
 
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
hear from
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor much about and that
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
would have been useful
 
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.049 align:start position:0%
would have been useful
um

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:48.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
I think some of the the point
 
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.090 align:start position:0%
I think some of the the point
um

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
representative yokelo raised about not
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
having heard from certain people
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
is a decent one but that to me would
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
signal more to me that we ought to
 
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
retain it rather than itl it
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't necessarily have any
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill on principle
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I just wish we could have gotten some
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
representative 11.
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
um after reading the bill and giving it
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
some thought and listening to
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative yokella and
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher what comes to
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
my mind is the inflation that all of us
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
are facing and the
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
prices of everything going up
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
and raising the amount available
 
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
to have someone join an organization and
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
then benefit from the information the
 
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.110 align:start position:0%
then benefit from the information the
organization

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
can provide
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be totally worth it in
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
2023 terms so I would support an auto
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
pass of this bill
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.549 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
power

00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
so um the the twenty dollar cap was
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
established in 1977 and to my knowledge
 
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
there has not been a bill to raise it
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
and that's quite a that's quite a long
 
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.630 align:start position:0%
and that's quite a that's quite a long
time

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
so I would support this increase from 20
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
to 50 if it was optional but clearly on
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
line four of the bill statute it's it's
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
an unfunded State mandate and I'm um
 
00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:39.549 align:start position:0%
an unfunded State mandate and I'm um
unwilling

00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
unwilling
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
to increase an unfunded State mandate so
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote itl based on for those
 
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.649 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote itl based on for those
reasons

00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
um so also looking at our notes I note
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
that we have an amendment here from
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative yokella so I was
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
I I would like to know
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
um why we are going straight to itl
 
00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:05.649 align:start position:0%
um why we are going straight to itl
before

00:23:05.649 --> 00:23:05.659 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative of your color would you
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
I am not sure that I
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
I think that I would support the bill
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh as amended but I'm not confident that
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
such an amendment would be able to pass
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so I would I wouldn't vote for it
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
without an amendment and so that's why I
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
I chose to go with itl first
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
but if it if the itls failed I'd be
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
happy to put it forward with the
 
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.529 align:start position:0%
happy to put it forward with the
amendment

00:23:41.529 --> 00:23:41.539 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
representative status
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
question of the chair
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
um a concern over whether an amendment
 
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
will pass or not it is adequate
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
justification for not bringing forth the
 
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.210 align:start position:0%
justification for not bringing forth the
amendment

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
the maker of the amendment chose not to
 
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.140 align:start position:0%
put it forward if as he said if this itl
 
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
fails he could certainly bring forth
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so as I said I mean as the maker of
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
the motion it's my choice to make the
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
motion that I that I choose to make
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
right that I don't have to make any
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
specific motion just because I prepared
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
this I you know I talk to people and I'm
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
not sure just for the expediency of time
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh that it would pass and so therefore I
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
just skip right to where I thought the
 
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.409 align:start position:0%
just skip right to where I thought the
eventual

00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%
eventual
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
um the bill was going to eventually go
 
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
in an expedience of time so thank you
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.690 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
priest

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
priest
 
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I am too going to
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
vote against italing this bill
 
00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
the three individuals of the town that
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
this is targeting they provide very
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
valuable services
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
to their residents and businesses
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
and I think raising their membership
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
from 25 to 50
 
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
it's an it's a no-brainer I mean
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
especially if it's been
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
um the 25 was established in 1977.
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
um as reported by the deputy so I I
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
don't think this is an issue we need to
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
keep them up to speed on the current
 
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:31.940 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations and and and
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that can make their jobs
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
easier in these very challenging times
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I I feel pretty much
 
00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:50.059 align:start position:0%
the same way the only thing we're doing
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
is uh changing the the amount of the
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
dues so the the concerns that have been
 
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:01.220 align:start position:0%
voiced uh
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be really in the bill
 
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
the bill is only when he's changing the
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
amount of money we're already committed
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
to do all the any of the other things
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
that are already in the the law so I
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
can't i.tl it I have I would have to
 
00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.950 align:start position:0%
can't i.tl it I have I would have to
vote

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
ought to pass if a motion is made
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
besides the bill is submitted by my
 
00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:27.049 align:start position:0%
besides the bill is submitted by my
senator

00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Guthrie any
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions uh
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
microphone representative Guthrie
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.549 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
seeing no more I'm just going to make a
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
quick comment on it and re reiterate uh
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
what representative yukela and
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative power talked about
 
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
originally I thought this was a very
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
simplistic bill just it's money but it
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
goes beyond money and it goes to the
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
issue of where that money goes and it is
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
a mandate
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
line four
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
um where it talks about it says each
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
town and City shall pay annually it
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't give him the option it says
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
shell over on six It also says such
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
amounts shall be due annual membership
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
so I think that uh sometimes it's not
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
just about the dollar value yes there
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
has been inflation but in this it's as
 
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
much or more about
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to if it's a process or
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it but uh so I
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
would agree at this point on the itel
 
00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.090 align:start position:0%
would agree at this point on the itel
motion

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
further comments questions clerk uh
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for your
 
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:39.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for your
comments

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.370 align:start position:0%
comments
um

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
I understand that mandates can be
 
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.669 align:start position:0%
I understand that mandates can be
overbearing

00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes one-sided sometimes unclear I
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
think that mandating that town officials
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
have the education that they can receive
 
00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.930 align:start position:0%
have the education that they can receive
from

00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:02.779 align:start position:0%
local organizations that can provide it
 
00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:06.419 align:start position:0%
is worth a mandate in my opinion thank
 
00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:07.549 align:start position:0%
is worth a mandate in my opinion thank
you

00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.730 align:start position:0%
and efficient discharge of their duties
and

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
um maybe there is a a
 
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
reason to increase the annual membership
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
whether that to
 
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.310 align:start position:0%
whether that to
um

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of Education that
 
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
goes to the
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
um these Town officials we didn't hear
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
that but maybe that is what is necessary
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
under the the way that that the law is
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
currently it this money can be
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
diverted away from that education into
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
other other parts
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
um specifically uh
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
in uh it can be transferred into
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
accounts that uh are are regulated by
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 15 5 Roman 2.
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
which is accounts that fund lobbying and
 
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:18.260 align:start position:0%
not education
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
and so all this is trying to do is to
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
say yes if you want to increase you want
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
to have this this money for dues it
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
needs to go towards your your operations
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
of your uh of your uh Association or for
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
actual training not not go towards
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
lobbying if you want to do that it
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
should be additional money on top of the
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
dues or whatever we're not requiring
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
that these local uh
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
these local state agencies these are the
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
only ones I believe that are required
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
that these local municipalities
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
are required to fund the ones like nhma
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that are optional but
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
these are required and so these need to
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
be for their stated purpose for their
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
operations and for the education of
 
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
these Town officials and nothing more or
 
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.210 align:start position:0%
these Town officials and nothing more or
nothing

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
out uh that would be uh considered
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
lobbying I think that's outside of that
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we should be mandating the towns to
 
00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:24.539 align:start position:0%
do or you know to fund so thank you
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative comments
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
represent uh priests
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
yes will the speaker the the last
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
speaker and the sponsor of this bill
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
answer a question that I have
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
he may answer it if why don't you state
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
your question and we'll see if he wants
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
to answer the question is he alluded to
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
the fact that there was all this
 
00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
information out there that towns are
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
using their membership monies for
 
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
lobbying and I haven't seen that and so
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
where this is coming from and where the
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
information is thank you
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
do respond
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm happy to comment and
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
say that this is if
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
if as you surmise that none of their
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
membership dues were being used for
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
lobbying then this would have no effect
 
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
right this would only have effect if
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
they were trying to transfer some of
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
their membership dues away from their
 
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
operating expenses and their actual Duty
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
which is to train these Town officials
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
and moving that money into lobbying
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
efforts and so I'm just trying to create
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
a wall there and say if the state has
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
come in and say you have to be a member
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
of this organization and you have to get
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
trained because it's important that you
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
get trained so that we have Equitable
 
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
Taxation and all of this stuff
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
that if the state is doing that mandate
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
then we make sure the money goes where
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to go which is education
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
and specifically stated in that in the
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you represent uh representative
 
00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.609 align:start position:0%
thank you represent uh representative
majority

00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm opposed to the amendment on
 
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
on the grounds that I've heard because I
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
think that if there are organizations
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
that also do Lobby I'm not gonna not
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
gonna argue that point but if they do
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
lobby but also provide training
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
um nhma for instance that name has come
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
up provides all kinds of different
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
training where maybe now that these
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
organizations can't participate in that
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
or can't benefit from it I just wonder
 
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
if that kind of confusion may arise by
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
adding this language and for that reason
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
I would be opposed but I you know tell
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
me that I'm wrong and that's fine
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative uh we
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
had representative Guthrie next actually
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you I just like to say that as I
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
said I think before that lobbying is not
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
a duty word no and that it's it is in
 
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:05.060 align:start position:0%
fact sometimes education
 
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:07.820 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
not support the amendment because I
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
don't have any concern about that area
 
00:35:15.609 --> 00:35:15.619 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I appreciate the
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak although I'm a
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
substitute so not that I don't trust my
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
colleague uh representative yokella but
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
I did look up the RSA to which
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
um the amendment refers and I'll just
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
read it very directly
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
um so it's a Prohibition on state funds
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
or in this case would be the town funds
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
to Lobby or attempt to influence
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislation participate in political
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
activity or contribute funds to any
 
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
entity engaged in these activities as a
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
person who has
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
basically cut my political teeth on
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reform
 
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
um I think it's extremely important that
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
we make sure taxpayer funds don't go to
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying lobbying itself is not a dirty
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
word because it can be education but
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
paid lobbying paid lobbying is quite
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
different and to use taxpayer funds to
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
lobby for a legislative outcome when
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers didn't have a say in
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
that is quite problematic to me on a
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
number of levels so for that reason I
 
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:17.220 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
we represent oh
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh yokella thank you I
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to kind of comment on
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative manageri's concerns about
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
um so this would not affect an inch May
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
um they so this is only for these
 
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.109 align:start position:0%
um they so this is only for these
specific

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
um associations that are mandated that
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
we join in the state right this wouldn't
 
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.250 align:start position:0%
we join in the state right this wouldn't
uh

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
um nhma can put 100 of their Municipal
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh uh uh
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
um dues yes dues to lobbying if they so
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
choose the the this statute is is for
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
being making sure that our town officers
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
are trained and educated
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
um and that is what these dues are
 
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
supposed to facilitate and that is the
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
whole section of this statute if they
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to do additional things oven be
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
over and beyond that I think that should
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
be optional for those Town
 
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
um uh towns people to be able to pay for
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
that or not right that this is a state
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
Mandate of what we are saying is the
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
bare minimum that the that the um those
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
towns do and so since this is a mandate
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
um from the state saying you have to do
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
this you have to join this
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
um that I think gets a little bit
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
different than just saying like no we're
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
not going to allow it I think that you
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
know they could raise money in other
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
ways by just asking or saying like Hey
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
um you know charge for for like
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal accounting uh we we pay dues
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
to nhma and my local
 
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.089 align:start position:0%
to nhma and my local
um

00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
town but then when we go to trainings we
 
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
actually have to pay additional
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
sometimes additional money to go to that
 
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
training right and so there's no reason
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
that these other organizations couldn't
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
do that and raise the money from that
 
00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
and that could get diverted into
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
lobbying all of that is possible right
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's not forbidding any of that I'm just
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
saying that um you know the bare minimum
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
that the state has said is a mandate
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're not we should not divert that
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
money into to lobbying efforts that's
 
00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
that's the only
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
concern kind of thing hope that
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
clarifies kind of the intent thank you
 
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
did I see representative L word's hand
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
up no okay represent power
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so relative to
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment one I I would like to
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
point out that the statute in front of
 
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.170 align:start position:0%
point out that the statute in front of
us

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
um 31 8
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the town offices Association
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that this is mandatory
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
because it says shall whereas with
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
regard to dues paid to organizations
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
such as the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
Association and the New Hampshire School
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
Board Association those
 
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.410 align:start position:0%
Board Association those
um

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:11.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.750 align:start position:0%
um
associations

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
those relationships and um in the paying
 
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
of the dues to those latter
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
organizations is optional there are
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
towns that choose not to pay those dues
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
and therefore not to have an association
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
with those organizations so I just want
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative Gallagher
 
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.250 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative Gallagher
um

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
so as to whether this is mandatory or
 
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.510 align:start position:0%
so as to whether this is mandatory or
not

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.530 align:start position:0%
not
um

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:50.060 align:start position:0%
so yes it does say shell paper
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
It also says the the amount page shall
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
not exceed so that to me seems to apply
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
that can be any amount less than that as
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
long as they pay something like they
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
could theoretically just pay one cent or
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
something and because I would be paying
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
something and it would be an amount that
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
would not exceed either of those so I I
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't or they could just if they're
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
already paying 20 they could just keep
 
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
paying 20 and
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I would see that as keeping
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
in in with it so yeah I I don't see them
 
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
as I don't see this as mandating
 
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars I see it as
 
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.390 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars I see it as
um

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:37.820 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
I guess this may be a devil's advocate
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
question or comment but if this is
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
perceived to be an unfunded mandate
 
00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be an unfunded mandate at
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
any level at all
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
not to exceed five cents
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.609 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
chairman a question that I had and I I
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
did not I I don't recall because I
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
didn't note it in my notes from the
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
hearing is if anybody could inform me as
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
to how the the do's or the fees get set
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
is it true that each organization
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
sets the fee and then in turn the
 
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:35.339 align:start position:0%
municipality pays it or is it a donation
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
thanks for letting me speak
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
well I can't speak to how the
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
legislative body was thinking in 1977
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
when they when when they put this in but
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
what I can say is I think it would cost
 
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers a lot more money to have
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
to pay for programs to teach these
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
clerks and teach these people so I think
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
they're getting beneficial information
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
and if we had to run that program it
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
would cost us a lot more I think I think
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
this is an affordable program and that
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
could be why only certain groups were
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
mandated to be a part of it because tax
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
laws change and they need to be educated
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
on tax laws right we can't just assume
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to know that information
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
and I see this as ain't
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
um a way that we can keep in line with
 
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
what we were doing and and it would cost
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers a lot more to do it a
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:39.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative uh Reed thank you and um
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
just to be clear we're we're discussing
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
the amendment currently which so not the
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
uh merits of the underlying Bill whether
 
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
the limit is or what's mandate and
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
what's not mandated
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
um so to bring it back to the underlying
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
bill I wanted to add one thing to my
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
previous comment which is
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
um whilst campaign Finance reform is
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
technically different than lobbying
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
reform the the intent is uh largely the
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
same which is to make sure that we have
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
a government that functions and
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
represents the people and I just want to
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
add that on the federal level again this
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
is campaign and not lobbying reform but
 
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
on the federal level it is so extreme
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
that if you're a federal employee or
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
many federal employees you receive money
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
as part of your job as a federal
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
employee from the government
 
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
by the Hatch Act you are not allowed to
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
even have a campaign sign in your own
 
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.170 align:start position:0%
even have a campaign sign in your own
yard

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
yard
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
so again speaking to the actual
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment before us I think that the
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
merits of it to separate
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
um the taxpayer funds from lobbying is
 
00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
um the taxpayer funds from lobbying is
important

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:50.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
seeing no more comments I will say
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
I never expected such
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
an extended debate over a one-word one
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
one number change in a bill I've also
 
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
been requested to take a two-minute
 
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
been requested to take a two-minute
recess

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
recess
 
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
um by this three-minute Recess by the
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
senior member of the minority party so
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
we will just everybody remain seated
 
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
okay everybody
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
um as you recall during the the hearing
 
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
it was um noted that the language the
 
00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:45.380 align:start position:0%
grandma needed to be um fixed to further
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
clarify the the bill
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
in going about that a number of other
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
issues were identified with the bill
 
00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:58.010 align:start position:0%
issues were identified with the bill
itself

00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:54:03.049 --> 00:54:03.059 align:start position:0%
and the grammar fixes that were being
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
made so
 
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:05.870 align:start position:0%
made so
um

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
the problem well we understand and we we
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
know that under 49b a town May adopt a
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
charter that provides for an optional
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
form of legislative body and in 1991
 
00:54:22.619 --> 00:54:24.309 align:start position:0%
form of legislative body and in 1991
when

00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 49d was adopted there were at that
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
time through only three optional forms
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
of a legislative body under D3 that was
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
the Town Council the budgetary town
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
meeting and the representative town
 
00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:41.569 align:start position:0%
meeting and the representative town
meeting

00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
as noted by Roman numerals one two and
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
three and then sometimes later two
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
additional optional forms of legislative
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
body were added and that's 1A and 2A
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
and the problem was is that they were
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
not properly referenced back in D colon
 
00:55:02.819 --> 00:55:03.890 align:start position:0%
not properly referenced back in D colon
2.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
2.
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
and so Senate Bill 111 the whole purpose
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
of it was to clarify
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
um these sorts of things
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
so um to speak to the amendment itself
 
00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:19.220 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines seven and eight
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
those words in bold they were they're
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
there to make clear that a town May
 
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
adopt a charter
 
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
with one of the five optional forms of
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
legislative body that is enumerated
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
under our 49d colon 3. the remainder of
 
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
line eight lines eight and then nine and
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
part in in ten that is the whole intent
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to make clear that towns
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
that adopt a charter
 
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.370 align:start position:0%
that adopt a charter
under

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
um D colon 3 Roman numeral one which is
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
the Town Council
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
form of option optional form of
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
legislative body that they shall have
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
the same powers and authorities as a
 
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
city council and that was the whole
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill so that's why that's
 
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
there then you also see
 
00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.030 align:start position:0%
there then you also see
um

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
changes to the last sentence which is in
 
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
lines 10 and 11. as you can see this
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
form is struck and it had to be struck
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
in part of the problem with the original
 
00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:29.579 align:start position:0%
bill was is that with the addition of
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
the amended words
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
it just didn't make sense so what that
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
last change in lines 10 and 11 does is
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
it makes it clear that this form refers
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
to a budgetary town meeting
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
um under Roman numeral two
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
and then it just the rest of the text is
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
is the same
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
so I hope that I made that clear
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%

00:57:03.359 --> 00:57:05.210 align:start position:0%

um seconds it uh just speaking briefly
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
to it the the original Bill itself quite
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues in my opinion on it and
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
what I've tried to do in the amendment
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
is if you look at the I took item two
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
now is basically what was item number
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral five before
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
and have
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
placed that in as a basically a
 
01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.530 align:start position:0%
placed that in as a basically a
recommendation

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:35.540 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
when temporary assistance is provided to
 
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
residents of the municipalities they may
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
communicate coordinate assistant options
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
to include reimbursement from that
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
person's Municipality of origin and that
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
was an addition made in the original
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
I'm just speaking to the amendment for
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
now so that's all I'll say on that
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
other firm further comments questions on
 
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have questions on Roman
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
numerals two three and four
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
of the bill the underlying Bill and I'm
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
assuming the ear Amendment does not
 
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
change those
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
it eliminates those it eliminates those
 
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.990 align:start position:0%

01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much this is the
 
01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
question to the sponsor of the amendment
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh could you kind of give us your ideas
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
why you're proposing this amendment and
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of the amendment is to
 
01:02:45.299 --> 01:02:47.270 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of the amendment is to
eliminate

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
what I consider uh poorly constructed
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
poorly written
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
other pieces of the original Bill I know
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to the amendment but items
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
two three and four there's a lot of uh
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
discussion on those when we
 
01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:06.020 align:start position:0%
held the the hearing
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
issues about residency impacts on voting
 
01:03:10.619 --> 01:03:13.430 align:start position:0%
issues about residency impacts on voting
um

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
30 days resonance status put in here
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
consecutive 30 days here or there it was
 
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
not in my opinion just poorly poorly
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
written in it quite honestly my intent
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
was to recommend an itl on the entire
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
bill but in in
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
I guess the word would be showing some
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
good will to the sponsors
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
um I went and
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
used item five Roman numeral five which
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
now becomes item uh two Roman numeral
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I've I just my feeling is that there
 
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
was Amendment you know that was
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
introduced in the language in the bill
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
as written is is
 
01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:11.890 align:start position:0%
as written is is
um

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:11.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
very confusing and and problematic and
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that I feel that this bill
 
01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:20.809 align:start position:0%
um I think that I feel that this bill
um

01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
needs could benefit from from further
 
01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.109 align:start position:0%
needs could benefit from from further
um work

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
um work
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
and so therefore I would like to see it
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%

without recommendation
um

01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
I'll do it okay
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%

no
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll we'll figure out who will
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report will be
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the executive
 
01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up Senate Bill 222 relative
 
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
to the definition of broadband
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructures as a revenue producing
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
facility eligible for municipal revenue
 
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:27.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
and would like I would like to uh
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
do we have a second
 
01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
like the second that Mr chairman the
 
01:10:46.689 --> 01:10:46.699 align:start position:0%
representative Brown seconds that
 
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'll speak briefly to it I
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
this was one I apologize I know it came
 
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
to everybody late last night I tried to
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
get it to you as soon as I can uh
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon OLS didn't finish it
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
till then
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
um and I want to explain exactly why I
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted uh this amendment if you look on
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
line nine the Bold
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
and the state shall not be financially
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
liable for a default of such bonds the
 
01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:18.380 align:start position:0%
reason I added that in is these
 
01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:22.100 align:start position:0%
when reviewing the Senate hearing
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
the one of the sponsors himself actually
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
had concerns about the default and the
 
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
adding the communications District
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
and what I wanted to do was
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
call it what you want lay down a marker
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
that this committee for future
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
legislators actually understood that
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
there was always the potential
 
01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
the odds of that happening are probably
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
slim the difference here is in the past
 
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
these bonds have been for regional water
 
01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:09.500 align:start position:0%
districts and
 
01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities we are now adding in very
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
High uh technical
 
01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.050 align:start position:0%
High uh technical
broadband

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
where the technology can change
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
extremely rapidly
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
during the testimony on this bill I
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
asked the and again this was the same
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
concerns the senator had I asked you
 
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
Broadband with wires is not going to be
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
when will it be superseded by either
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
Wireless or
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
or satellite and the answer was well
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
probably around three to five years
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
we had a bill
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
last year in finance that expended over
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars to hardwire the North
 
01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.590 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars to hardwire the North
country

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
and when you averaged it out it was at
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
to the tune of almost twenty thousand
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
dollars per
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
household that they were gonna wire up
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
which is a ridiculous amount of money
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
for technology that could be changing in
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
an instant
 
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.630 align:start position:0%
an instant
um

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.189 align:start position:0%
um
satellite

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
satellite
 
01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:24.500 align:start position:0%
exists now
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
and in three years who knows what
 
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
they'll be doing uh with satellite and
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
or again Wireless itself so again I
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
wanted to put a a marker down that this
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
committee was actually considering the
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
possibility of a default I know in the
 
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
previous sentence existing language that
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
talks about the pledge of faith and
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
credit that's different than a default
 
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
of the bonds so that's my reasoning
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
behind the added language
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I certainly appreciate that you
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to as your words lay that marker
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
down because it provides the kind of
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal protection that I think is is
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
important Financial Protection is
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
important but the question is
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
um was the language vetted by Bond
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
Council so that we have the assurances
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't trigger something that
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
they can't that the towns cannot or that
 
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.510 align:start position:0%
they can't that the towns cannot or that
wow

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
wow
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh so this doesn't trigger something uh
 
01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
on my watch
 
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:36.500 align:start position:0%
again on my watch
 
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:39.659 align:start position:0%

01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
answer is no I did not

Mr chairman I did speak with the New
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association before
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
the session and they did indicate to me
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it would not cause a problem for
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
the bond a change in the procedure but
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
not a problem for the bonding
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brown
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
this uh whole process has been going on
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
for about the past six years or so we're
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
trying to get some help
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
so folks can get internet they'll put
 
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
their residents up in the north country
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
and this is another not going to use the
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
word tool but something that's going to
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
allow these businesses and citizens of
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
the North Country to get some internet
 
01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.770 align:start position:0%
the North Country to get some internet
connections

01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
connections
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's going to allow them to as a group
 
01:15:36.169 --> 01:15:36.179 align:start position:0%
borrow money as bonds uh I've been on
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
this committee since I started back in
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
2018 and I've never seen this particular
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
wordage stuck into an amendment where it
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
was directed particularly at water and
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
the uh and the internet as far as the uh
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
the internet changing yeah it does
 
01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
change it's probably going to change a
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
lot and it's probably going to be a
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
couple years before uh
 
01:15:59.930 --> 01:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
this service gets going but it's not
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
enough us to decide that no we're not
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
going to give these people the
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get some funding to uh
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
get the internet it's up to them to
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
decide how they want to proceed once
 
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
they get the money and then ask you
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair I have the same
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
concerns uh I know we've talked about
 
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.149 align:start position:0%
concerns uh I know we've talked about
the

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:30.140 align:start position:0%
um the life span of broadband hardwired
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
out into the remote communities
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
within my own town which is fairly
 
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
compact we still have Broadband lines we
 
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:44.300 align:start position:0%
also have wireless and we have uh um
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
satellite Communications but we also
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
have even with all the antenna that have
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
been attached to buildings and and
 
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
erected we still have
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
empty spots where people cannot
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
communicate including my fire department
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't want to count on the
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
improvements to those others
 
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.790 align:start position:0%
improvements to those others

are speaking actually to the amendment
 
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
here not to the actual bill itself the
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I would just like
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
to point out that the wording of the
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
amendment May in fact contravene
 
01:17:37.689 --> 01:17:37.699 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
where in RSA 33 it says the Govern the
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
governor and Council meaning the
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
executive Council May award an
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
unconditional State guarantee of the
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
principle of an interest on bonds issued
 
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
under RSA 33.
 
01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:55.669 align:start position:0%
under RSA 33.
um

01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
with if we adopt this amendment
 
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
that effectively prevents the governor
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
and Council from doing what's written in
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
I feel that the underlying bill is a
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
good bill and one that is long overdue
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I know people in parts of the state
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
who are unable to access Broadband in
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form
 
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
and it while it is true that the
 
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
technology changes quickly other forms
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
of technology are also changing quickly
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that that's an issue I
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
think people are getting used to things
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
changing quickly
 
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
and the the germane issue here is that
 
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities need to have the
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
authority and the ability under our laws
 
01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes a question of uh representative
 
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.330 align:start position:0%
yes a question of uh representative
stavis

01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
stavis
 
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding correct me if I'm
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
wrong that everyone has access to
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
satellite internet communications is
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
it is partially correct it's actually
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
not correct
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
um I have relatives who live in the town
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
of Freedom New Hampshire which is
 
01:22:03.729 --> 01:22:03.739 align:start position:0%
up there and on the border with Maine
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
they don't they can't get access to
 
01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
starlink which is the Tesla uh satellite
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
system there's no broadband access there
 
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
there's just it's a desert it's an
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
internet desert and they have been
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
waiting and waiting and waiting and not
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
just in freedom but in the entire Lake
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
Area there they've been waiting for
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
years for the state to help them get
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
access to the internet which is now
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
become a public utility you can't live
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
without it really and without success so
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
starlink not available regular internet
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
not available a Communications Wasteland
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh I
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
you expanded my field of knowledge there
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
because I was under the understanding
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
that if you could look up into the sky
 
01:23:00.169 --> 01:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
you could get some sort of satellite
 
01:23:00.179 --> 01:23:01.669 align:start position:0%
you could get some sort of satellite
communication

01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
communication
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
represent representative Elwood
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'm a little
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:17.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
no no not no representative
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
what is it um so aside from the the uh
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
information that the ranking member
 
01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:34.100 align:start position:0%
provided about potential gaps in
 
01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:37.340 align:start position:0%
satellites like starlink
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh uh that are provided I can tell you
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure maybe this is not the
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
common experience of many of the members
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
of this committee but as a renter uh
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
someone who rents somebody else's
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
property or somebody in an apartment
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
building you cannot put up a satellite
 
01:23:54.169 --> 01:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
dish very frequently almost never can
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
put up a satellite dish so no you do not
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just for the committee I do
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
live in the Wasteland and we do have
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
access to Satellite Communication in
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
that area Karen Carroll County because
 
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
that's what I initially had at my home
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
but I do now have regular internet and I
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
do support the bill overall so
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Elwood
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I too have
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
and television
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
um have any problems with that so I
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%

Representative Davies
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
could you tell us that RSA that you've

quoted a little while ago for 35

whatever it was I just it wasn't fast
 
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:01.940 align:start position:0%

seeing none I'm gonna make one um
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
one of the issues I found
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
we we continually hear about the housing
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
crisis and the cost of uh housing that
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
continually goes up and up and up I it
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
was interesting to hear a comment made
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
by someone given testimony last week
 
01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
that by uh
 
01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
getting Broadband to everybody's houses
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
that would raise that actually raises
 
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
the prices of real estate which is kind
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
of contrary to the housing crisis
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%

representative Buzz Davis
 
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative power would you like to
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment thank you Mr
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
the input that this um
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
that representative infantine
 
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
heard during the hearing
 
01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:42.290 align:start position:0%
heard during the hearing
so

01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
just to highlight
 
01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does is that on page
 
01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.510 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does is that on page
two

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
the there's a sentence that was removed
 
01:45:54.119 --> 01:45:56.209 align:start position:0%
the there's a sentence that was removed
um

01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
because the the original Bill the
 
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
language was
 
01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:01.609 align:start position:0%
language was
um

01:46:01.609 --> 01:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
somewhat convoluted
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
so it just it clarifies things and
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
um eliminates may not require and and
 
01:46:13.810 --> 01:46:13.820 align:start position:0%
states it
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
positively and straightforward and
 
01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.850 align:start position:0%
positively and straightforward and
secondly

01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
there was another sentence that was
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
completely removed
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that's the sentence that had the the
 
01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
word onerous in it
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
and I had commented that that was um
 
01:46:35.649 --> 01:46:35.659 align:start position:0%
very vague and subjective
 
01:46:35.659 --> 01:46:37.330 align:start position:0%
very vague and subjective
and

01:46:37.330 --> 01:46:37.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
additionally as you can see through
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the number of days has been
 
01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.109 align:start position:0%
throughout the number of days has been
increased

01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
increased
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
um in a few lines to give more time to
 
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
um react to the business and that's
 
01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
required within that line of Statute for
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
example going from 20 to 30 business
 
01:47:04.129 --> 01:47:04.139 align:start position:0%
days on line nine on page two and
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
um the change was made similarly in
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:17.629 align:start position:0%
um
I

01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
this is this bill is important and it
 
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
reflects a lot of
 
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
um collaboration with the stakeholders
 
01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
working also closely with nhma so I
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
would um hope that people would support
 
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative representative Gallagher
 
01:47:43.450 --> 01:47:43.460 align:start position:0%
um so I believe so it looks like we have
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
two separate amendments here
 
01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
um so does
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
just to clarify about the one we're on
 
01:47:56.689 --> 01:47:56.699 align:start position:0%
1627h so that's meant to supersede the
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
other one 1429 each I take it um and
 
01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
um basically be an improvement over that
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
is that correct to be clear we never
 
01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
adopted that first one we were the only
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
thing that we've heard is the actual
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
bill itself so
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
uh rep infantine did bring that one and
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
gave it to us but we never acted on it
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
so this one here would be the first
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that we actually Act
 
01:48:30.970 --> 01:48:30.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
01:48:36.729 --> 01:48:36.739 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I will also be
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment because I
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
think it does offer some clarification
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
of the questions that we had and we
 
01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.410 align:start position:0%
of the questions that we had and we
heard

01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
at our last
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
and with that I would be fully in
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
support of Bill HSB 78 thank you thank
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
you for the comments questions
 
01:49:06.050 --> 01:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none will ask the quote sorry
 
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:08.219 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:49:09.649 --> 01:49:09.659 align:start position:0%
you have to reach out a little further I
 
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.310 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
a the reasoning
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
for this change
 
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
and the only thing I could
 
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
see is the
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's to help out the contractors but yet
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
it takes away
 
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
and the assurances
 
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
to a municipality
 
01:49:48.669 --> 01:49:48.679 align:start position:0%
for retaining any money for uh
 
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:51.380 align:start position:0%
improvements that are
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
work that hadn't been
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
done in a
 
01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.250 align:start position:0%
done in a
uh

01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
in the proper methods like when they're
 
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
building the roads and so forth I've
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
I've seen them come through and put
 
01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:09.179 align:start position:0%
blocks underneath the
 
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
sewer lines and then just backfill and
 
01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:13.550 align:start position:0%
sewer lines and then just backfill and
then

01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of years down the road the
 
01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
town's liable for it
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
why it's the
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
the build seems to be protecting the
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
contractors rather than protecting the
 
01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:28.189 align:start position:0%
contractors rather than protecting the
municipalities

01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
is is that is that a correct
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
assumption on my part
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the Assumption your
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
assumption is I think you'd have to
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
decide that one on yourself I don't
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
believe that's the case
 
01:50:43.199 --> 01:50:45.530 align:start position:0%
believe that's the case
okay

01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none of that as the clerk to
 
01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:56.870 align:start position:0%
seeing none of that as the clerk to
Colorado

01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%

itself is the bill so

important bill and that substantial time

01:52:57.410 --> 01:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
this with the stakeholders and it it's a
 
01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:58.790 align:start position:0%
this with the stakeholders and it it's a
reasonable

01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
I guess compromise if you will and the
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
end result is that it will
 
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
make it more
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
efficient or provide the the ability for
 
01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
home builders to provide housing for the
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire so I would um
 
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
hope that the committee would support
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%

representative
 
01:53:35.590 --> 01:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
yes I will be supporting SB 782
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
having served as a planner both in the
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
public and private sectors I know the
 
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
games that are played
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
um by some people regarding development
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
applications and this kind of results
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
into thousands of dollars of penalties
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
and I think this really kind of
 
01:53:56.639 --> 01:53:58.609 align:start position:0%
and I think this really kind of
clarifies

01:53:58.609 --> 01:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
who does what what time and where and
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
what's expected
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it kind of levels the playing field
 
01:54:08.209 --> 01:54:08.219 align:start position:0%
and I think that's important if we move
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
on and try to address our housing crisis
 
01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:14.820 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill 47
 
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
barriers to increase density of
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to go ahead and introduce a
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2023
 
01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:08.219 align:start position:0%
1677h that was sent to everybody about a
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
week maybe a little more than a week ago
 
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh committee email
 
01:56:16.850 --> 01:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
and is there do I have a second on that
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
second that Mr chairman representative
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.119 --> 01:56:25.129 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:56:25.129 --> 01:56:25.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:28.609 --> 01:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to start out by saying that
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:56:32.689 --> 01:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
encouraged at the beginning of this
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
session chairs and vice chairs and
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
individuals that um
 
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
stop the commissions
 
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
we have a commission to study
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
commissions we have I think north of 250
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
different commissions that the speaker
 
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
and his assistants spend months actually
 
01:56:56.689 --> 01:56:56.699 align:start position:0%
Staffing every time there's a
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
a new legislature in session I don't
 
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
believe they've completed at this time
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
most of those commissions don't meet
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
a lot of times they don't do what
 
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to but yet they're
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
still out there and he has been
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
asked us to
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
stop with the commissions
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
my my personal thought
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
as we don't need it we have a special
 
01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:22.490 align:start position:0%
as we don't need it we have a special
committee

01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
on housing
 
01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:26.089 align:start position:0%
on housing
um

01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
we've got this committee
 
01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:31.609 align:start position:0%
we've got this committee
and

01:57:31.609 --> 01:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
when you look at the the sponsors of the
 
01:57:37.729 --> 01:57:37.739 align:start position:0%
bills the majority of them are our
 
01:57:37.739 --> 01:57:39.410 align:start position:0%
bills the majority of them are our
Senators

01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
Senators
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it would almost appear that this has
 
01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not going to go down that road
 
01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.870 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not going to go down that road
um

01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
so in in the amendment
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
um since the majority of the sponsors
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
are Senators uh one of the changes that
 
01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:03.659 align:start position:0%
I I made was the number of members of
 
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
the Senate that would be on the
 
01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:05.990 align:start position:0%
the Senate that would be on the
committee

01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
they they uh heavily loaded it to being
 
01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:12.500 align:start position:0%
members of the House
 
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I've brought that back they had it
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
at a two and six ratio I brought it back
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
and said
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
you have it you have three members and
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
um a couple other minor changes here and
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
there the the biggest one I want to
 
01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:32.580 align:start position:0%
point out was
 
01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:35.639 align:start position:0%
to me this was lacking the original
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
commission bill was lacking in what I
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
would consider fiscal oversight that's
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
what I care about is the fiscal side
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
and uh 2B which starts down on line 31
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
talks about a lot of those and that's is
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
the the impacts that the development
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
including that development
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
would be to look at school enrollment
 
01:59:01.609 --> 01:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
and property values the next page it
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
talks about traffic maintenance erode
 
01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:06.020 align:start position:0%
public works department Staffing
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
increases in Municipal Services fire
 
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
police all that trash removal water
 
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:12.290 align:start position:0%
police all that trash removal water
sources

01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:14.410 align:start position:0%
sources
and

01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:14.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
that was lacking in the original uh
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.689 --> 01:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
um there was also one other change down
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
at the bottom
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
where was it I changed the date on the
 
01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
when they would first have to report it
 
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
it brought it up a little closer so they
 
01:59:39.490 --> 01:59:39.500 align:start position:0%
would have a little bit more time
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
um honestly
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
without the amendment I'll be vote I
 
01:59:53.450 --> 01:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
would vote against it only because again
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
my my thought process is if there's a
 
01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
group of individuals who want to
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
accomplish something you don't need a
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
commission to do it you've got a group
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
of senators
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
or if I had a a bill or something that I
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to do
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
I'd gather the people that I thought
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
could get me there and come up with the
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.209 align:start position:0%
the plan
and

02:00:14.209 --> 02:00:14.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
put a bill forward
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm not a fan of pawning off
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
work on commissions
 
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and their folks
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
trying to staff these things and then
 
02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:33.589 align:start position:0%
trying to staff these things and then
the

02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
the meetings not being of much value in
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
the end so I I would ask that you
 
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
support the amendment if the Amendments
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
passes I will support it as a whole
 
02:00:45.770 --> 02:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise I will not so thank you uh
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I appreciate
 
02:00:54.169 --> 02:00:54.179 align:start position:0%
this this amendment because as you
 
02:00:57.890 --> 02:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
recall during the hearing I did ask the
 
02:00:57.900 --> 02:00:59.570 align:start position:0%
recall during the hearing I did ask the
um

02:00:59.570 --> 02:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
I believe it was the Prime sponsor I
 
02:01:05.810 --> 02:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
asked someone I don't recall who but I
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
was trying to get get to the point that
 
02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
part of the the the scope or one of the
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
focuses of this commission was to study
 
02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
the impacts of development and I asked
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
the question in so on page two line
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
eight of the bill
 
02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
one of the focuses is to study the
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
impacts of development and that they
 
02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
specifically point to school enrollments
 
02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
and property values so I appreciate the
 
02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
this amendment in that it IT addresses
 
02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:42.060 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to get at and the
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
answer was
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I said what other Municipal
 
02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.330 align:start position:0%
um I said what other Municipal
um

02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
what other things or resources would be
 
02:01:52.729 --> 02:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
impacted by by development that the
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
municipality would have to you know bear
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
and then I was pointed back oh we're
 
02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
looking at the public water and sewer
 
02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
but that was that's not enough so I do
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate because clearly there are as
 
02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
listed and enumerated here other impacts
 
02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:09.719 align:start position:0%
that are going to affect the
 
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
municipality and the cost of the
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
municipality so I will be supporting
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.639 --> 02:02:19.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:21.649 --> 02:02:21.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that you left out one
 
02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:24.890 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that you left out one
change

02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
uh that your amendment makes which is in
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
line 24.
 
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh I believe with the second page where
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
it omits the section which is Section I
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
on Conservation Commission and I'm
 
02:02:41.089 --> 02:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
wondering if that was an intentional
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh change or perhaps an error and if it
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
it was intentional can you explain your
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
thinking behind excluding conservation
 
02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:53.209 align:start position:0%
thinking behind excluding conservation
commissions

02:02:53.209 --> 02:02:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
um that was intentional it was not
 
02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.169 align:start position:0%
um that was intentional it was not
unintentional

02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
unintentional
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
um there's probably a few other place
 
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
things that I change that I um have not
 
02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of them the other one was
 
02:03:06.970 --> 02:03:06.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
Association of regional Planning
 
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
Commission in in H I left that out just
 
02:03:16.089 --> 02:03:16.099 align:start position:0%
personally because I don't believe that
 
02:03:20.209 --> 02:03:20.219 align:start position:0%
as I said my goal is more a from the
 
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
fiscal sense uh my concerns rather than
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
from the conservation
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
commission sense so that's why I looked
 
02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
it up
 
02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
it up
sure

02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and are there no fiscal consequences
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
to the impact on our environment
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
there may be but in my amendment I I
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
excluded that
 
02:03:55.609 --> 02:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:55.619 --> 02:04:00.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
very dyslexic but anyway back to this
 
02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.689 align:start position:0%
very dyslexic but anyway back to this
amendment

02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I agreed with much all that
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives as stavis has said about
 
02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
the need to have a person of
 
02:04:15.659 --> 02:04:16.990 align:start position:0%
the need to have a person of
conservation

02:04:16.990 --> 02:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
expertise on this study Commission
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
because conservation is one of the
 
02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
important factors in New Hampshire it
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
plays a vital part in the rural
 
02:04:27.719 --> 02:04:29.030 align:start position:0%
plays a vital part in the rural
communities

02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
and it would it makes it's one of the
 
02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
things that makes New Hampshire what it
 
02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:35.870 align:start position:0%
things that makes New Hampshire what it
is

02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's natural beauty and we take the
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
expertise out of this committee
 
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
we're kind of denying this how fact
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
research base that will not be included
 
02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
and I think they need to be included
 
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
also on the areas of study I was
 
02:04:58.810 --> 02:04:58.820 align:start position:0%
questioning why you didn't mention
 
02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
Cemetery sewer
 
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
since that's going to be more and more
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
critical especially if you are
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
developing at a higher density and
 
02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
making sure that the municipalities have
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
the sewer capacity or if they even have
 
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
a sewer to handle this thank you
 
02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:22.430 align:start position:0%
a sewer to handle this thank you
there

02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:23.530 align:start position:0%
there
yeah

02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:23.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
I believe that's in there representative
 
02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:33.870 align:start position:0%
I believe that's in there representative
priests

02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:36.050 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
public water and soon yeah line 20 line
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
that was already in the existing Bill
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative I didn't change that at
 
02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:47.570 align:start position:0%
representative I didn't change that at
all

02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative bro
 
02:05:52.250 --> 02:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
just a clarification I'm trying to
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
understand the environmental concerns
 
02:05:57.530 --> 02:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
since on line 17 it talks about the
 
02:05:58.609 --> 02:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
02:06:01.370 --> 02:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services or designee so am
 
02:06:02.689 --> 02:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
I missing something there during that
 
02:06:02.699 --> 02:06:04.609 align:start position:0%
I missing something there during that
conversation

02:06:04.609 --> 02:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
from the amendment it shows that
 
02:06:09.410 --> 02:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Speaker of the House
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
that is correct it is on there yes okay
 
02:06:13.250 --> 02:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to figure out where the
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns are in regard to
 
02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
so uh understanding that representative
 
02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
priests might want to answer that
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
question in a second
 
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
um my comment may actually be more to
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill but since the
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the amendment brought this
 
02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
point up I would like to respond to it
 
02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
which is you know of course all of us
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
have heard arguments against commissions
 
02:06:42.290 --> 02:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
and committees and there's so many
 
02:06:44.209 --> 02:06:44.219 align:start position:0%
studies and we study the studies of the
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
studies and all of that but I am with my
 
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
training as a molecular biologist I am
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
um in favor of gathering all information
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
and so I I've never really appreciated
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
the idea of we shouldn't study anything
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
really we should study as much as we
 
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
possibly can and be make the most
 
02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
informed decisions that we can possibly
 
02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:06.290 align:start position:0%
informed decisions that we can possibly
make

02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and I don't feel like we should say
 
02:07:12.169 --> 02:07:12.179 align:start position:0%
sorry to any of us legislators for
 
02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
having to do the work that we begged our
 
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
constituents to send us to go do and
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
even more so for a speaker any speaker
 
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
not just our current one who not only
 
02:07:23.450 --> 02:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
begs to be elected but then also begs us
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
to vote for him or her as speaker so
 
02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
they are asking for that job so I don't
 
02:07:29.930 --> 02:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
feel bad that they then have to do that
 
02:07:32.689 --> 02:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
work so I think it's good to study
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
things and be informed when we make our
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
decisions my issue with commissions and
 
02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
study committees comes in what voices
 
02:07:42.169 --> 02:07:42.179 align:start position:0%
are we amplifying to the exclusion of
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
what other voices and so I have a
 
02:07:46.129 --> 02:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
problem with excluding some voices and
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
taking out some voices like the
 
02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:49.370 align:start position:0%
taking out some voices like the
conservation

02:07:49.370 --> 02:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
02:07:52.490 --> 02:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
um voice in this scenario because that's
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
the real issue again Gathering as much
 
02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
information as possible I think is key
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
to making the most informed decisions
 
02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:59.930 align:start position:0%
to making the most informed decisions
possible

02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:01.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:04.609 --> 02:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
microphone representative
 
02:08:08.089 --> 02:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
uh representative treeleven then Hicks
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
jump on to this Conservation Commission
 
02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:16.550 align:start position:0%
jump on to this Conservation Commission
wagon

02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
wagon
 
02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
from a different point so maybe I'm
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
bringing up the rear or maybe I'm riding
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
up front with the coach person but what
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
I want to say is and my work as a real
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
estate broker over the years 35 and
 
02:08:28.679 --> 02:08:29.750 align:start position:0%
estate broker over the years 35 and
counting

02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
counting
 
02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
I have seen conservation commissions
 
02:08:35.570 --> 02:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
come into a scenario where a building in
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
a more urban setting that was adjacent
 
02:08:39.530 --> 02:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
to a wetlands and this is just one
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
example there are many
 
02:08:43.370 --> 02:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
needed to have the Conservation
 
02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
Commission look at the building and
 
02:08:49.129 --> 02:08:49.139 align:start position:0%
figure out with the building owner who
 
02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
wanted to sell the building how it could
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
be brought
 
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
to speed where we were then whatever
 
02:08:57.770 --> 02:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
year it was in regards to the
 
02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
regulations and to continue to protect
 
02:09:02.530 --> 02:09:02.540 align:start position:0%
our environment long story short
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission did a great job
 
02:09:08.209 --> 02:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
of interfacing and interacting with the
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%
Realtors involved the the owner of the
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
property the people who wanted to buy
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
the property and made very reasonable
 
02:09:20.089 --> 02:09:20.099 align:start position:0%
demands as to how the land had to be
 
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
handled before they would give it its
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
approval that building is still there
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
it's in Portsmouth it's on Islington
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
road and it has made money for all the
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
people who have used it and it has
 
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.189 align:start position:0%
people who have used it and it has
protected

02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
the environment the wetlands that are
 
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
behind it by listening to the very
 
02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:41.589 align:start position:0%
behind it by listening to the very
simple

02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
simple
 
02:09:45.729 --> 02:09:45.739 align:start position:0%
observations that those of us who aren't
 
02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:48.860 align:start position:0%
schooled in that might not understand
 
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm totally in favor of leaving the
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission in I think the
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
input's really important and and I have
 
02:09:58.370 --> 02:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
to say I think it has
 
02:10:01.129 --> 02:10:01.139 align:start position:0%
an economic effect this was probably 25
 
02:10:03.410 --> 02:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
years ago I think now it has even a
 
02:10:05.689 --> 02:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
bigger economic effect because they're
 
02:10:07.729 --> 02:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
not making any more water they're not
 
02:10:09.890 --> 02:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
making any more soil they're not making
 
02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
any we're not making any more rocks what
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
we got is what we got thanks
 
02:10:17.330 --> 02:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
02:10:19.370 --> 02:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'll just make one point to
 
02:10:21.169 --> 02:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
not believe are those points
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
um although I support those points uh I
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
was contacted by a member of the society
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
for the protection New Hampshire Forest
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives priests
 
02:10:37.250 --> 02:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
um again I would I echoed the the
 
02:10:43.209 --> 02:10:43.219 align:start position:0%
statements that have been made by
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and I have worked on study committees
 
02:10:56.770 --> 02:10:56.780 align:start position:0%
where the conservation
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
individual professional has played a
 
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
significant part
 
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
in the discussion and I think they need
 
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
to be part of this discussion
 
02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
second to the question that was raised
 
02:11:13.729 --> 02:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
by representative Brown
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
Protection is a great organization they
 
02:11:20.169 --> 02:11:20.179 align:start position:0%
have great services
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
conservation is not one of their things
 
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
that they do there
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
they protect our water resources
 
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
they you know they help with the sewers
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know infrastructure and air quality
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
but they don't do conservation
 
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:49.129 --> 02:11:49.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
um for recognizing me this uh
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't really understand how the com
 
02:11:59.810 --> 02:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
the conversation has gone
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
um this far down the road of
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
conservation being vital to this
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
Commission because the commission is
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
based is is studying the effects of
 
02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:13.850 align:start position:0%
based is is studying the effects of
density

02:12:13.850 --> 02:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
density
 
02:12:16.729 --> 02:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
and and the barriers to density so
 
02:12:19.330 --> 02:12:19.340 align:start position:0%
unless conservation and
 
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
conservation is a beneficiary of density
 
02:12:27.649 --> 02:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
because they have more open land if you
 
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
have you know the the property built out
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
every two acres then there's less land
 
02:12:35.689 --> 02:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
to conserve
 
02:12:39.290 --> 02:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm just it it seems like
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of discussion about
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
what they're bringing to this to the
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
discussion of the of this
 
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
commission there's not a lot of clarity
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
on what they're bringing to the
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
discussion of density and how are they
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
the cause of the of a barrier towards
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
density or are they
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how they are
 
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
um advising us on what are the barriers
 
02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
to density like the commission
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
can can someone that's in favor of that
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
clarify how they affect density which is
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
the study of this commission thank you
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recognize representative
 
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
majority next maybe he can address that
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
in his comment uh thank you Mr chair and
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I that I will but I'll
 
02:13:26.569 --> 02:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
I'll speak relative to what my
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission does in
 
02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
Northampton where what they're looking
 
02:13:31.850 --> 02:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
at is the value of land and if we're
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the density of of a piece
 
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
of property
 
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
um not only to talk about the value of
 
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
land among many other things they also
 
02:13:41.450 --> 02:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
talk about easements which allow people
 
02:13:43.129 --> 02:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
to access that land so if we're talking
 
02:13:45.410 --> 02:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
about density how do we get to a
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
valuable piece of land
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission is one of the
 
02:13:51.169 --> 02:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
first places that that the planning
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
board will go for advice on that and
 
02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
when you have a community again like
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
Northampton which is a third in
 
02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
conservation but we do have the rights
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
to have conservation subdivisions we
 
02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
really look at that interplay between
 
02:14:08.209 --> 02:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
the high the value of the land
 
02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
the access to that land and how much can
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
you build upon that land the
 
02:14:15.169 --> 02:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission is intimately
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
involved in all of those aspects so I
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
think it's a crucial piece of this I'm
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
not sure that I've answered your
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
question but it's a reason why I would
 
02:14:25.370 --> 02:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
really urge this commission to have to
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
include conservation thank you
 
02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair to that point about
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
how density and conservation Works
 
02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
um if you have open space planning which
 
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
we do an Exeter you can have more dense
 
02:14:45.169 --> 02:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
or you can work out a compromise with
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
the planning board to have a more dense
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
development if you put some of the land
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
into conservation that backs up with
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
another place that has conservation that
 
02:14:56.689 --> 02:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
already got density bonus so that's how
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
Exeter ended up having 30 percent of
 
02:15:02.089 --> 02:15:02.099 align:start position:0%
gland in conservation so there is there
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
is a bonus factor and I think that the
 
02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.970 align:start position:0%
is a bonus factor and I think that the
conservation

02:15:06.970 --> 02:15:06.980 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
02:15:09.850 --> 02:15:09.860 align:start position:0%
could be should be represented
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
represented because people don't know
 
02:15:14.930 --> 02:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
that people in the other groups are not
 
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.209 --> 02:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
so I I would I would vote against this
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
amendment for taking that out because
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
there is a reason for the the offset
 
02:15:30.050 --> 02:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
between and it would drive if you want
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
to keep when it's driving in Exeter
 
02:15:34.669 --> 02:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
density within our downtown because we
 
02:15:36.530 --> 02:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
can't expand into those areas that have
 
02:15:38.810 --> 02:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
been put into conservation so I think
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
that needs to be explained and it has to
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
have been put on the committee
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative service
 
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and not to belabor
 
02:15:50.209 --> 02:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
this but um for those of us who live in
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
cities that are already pretty dense the
 
02:15:55.129 --> 02:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission is absolutely
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
vital to guide conversations of of where
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
one can safely build without impinging
 
02:16:06.290 --> 02:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
on Wetlands impinging on important
 
02:16:09.290 --> 02:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
Wildlife corridors and in conservation
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
commissions are an integral part of
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
every municipality's master plan so you
 
02:16:15.649 --> 02:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
can't really get into a conversation
 
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
about where are we going to go with
 
02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
regard to density increasing density in
 
02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
housing without including the vital
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
players in the master planning process
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
so that's one aspect of why the
 
02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission representation
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
is important and I have a question for
 
02:16:35.810 --> 02:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
the chair if he will allow me
 
02:16:38.570 --> 02:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
which is if
 
02:16:41.389 --> 02:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
if the point of the amendment
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
is or the point the amendment seeks to
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
make is that there are already two
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
commission too many commissions studying
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
too many things why doesn't the
 
02:16:52.849 --> 02:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
amendment eliminate the commission
 
02:16:52.859 --> 02:16:55.070 align:start position:0%
amendment eliminate the commission
altogether

02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
I would be more than happy to answer
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:04.610 --> 02:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
desire would be to eliminate the
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
commission and not even begin the
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
commission to begin with
 
02:17:11.929 --> 02:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
do things to try to get along
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
if you if you would and this would be my
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is an attempt to
 
02:17:23.929 --> 02:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
make things get along a little bit
 
02:17:27.169 --> 02:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
better like I said I have no problem if
 
02:17:31.969 --> 02:17:31.979 align:start position:0%
uh if this amendment fails of making uh
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
we will make an itl motion on the whole
 
02:17:34.679 --> 02:17:36.169 align:start position:0%
we will make an itl motion on the whole
bill

02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
um if we need to and then we'll go to
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
the floor with that so as I said with
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
this with this amendment I'm more than
 
02:17:46.849 --> 02:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
happy to vote for it mainly because it
 
02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
includes the fiscal issues that are my
 
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
issues if we do if we're gonna
 
02:17:54.889 --> 02:17:54.899 align:start position:0%
you know vote this down just because of
 
02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
a conference Conservation Commission
 
02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
um like I say I'm more than happy to do
 
02:18:01.009 --> 02:18:01.019 align:start position:0%
an itl on it
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
02:18:05.209 --> 02:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't really know how this
 
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
works so I'll ask the question it seems
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
that many of us are stuck on the
 
02:18:11.089 --> 02:18:11.099 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission elimination from
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
you know in the amendment uh if the
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor were willing to add that back in
 
02:18:18.290 --> 02:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
and we could pass the amendment how does
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
that work
 
02:18:22.730 --> 02:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
that would require an amendment to the
 
02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:23.950 align:start position:0%
that would require an amendment to the
amendment

02:18:23.950 --> 02:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh which we're probably not going to
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of time for the other
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
option would be a motion of retain
 
02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
or we could also make a motion to
 
02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:37.370 align:start position:0%
or we could also make a motion to
um

02:18:37.370 --> 02:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:40.009 --> 02:18:40.019 align:start position:0%
recess this particular executive session
 
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
to a future date
 
02:18:46.730 --> 02:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
which will probably be happening anyway
 
02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
on another bill that we're going to be
 
02:18:50.209 --> 02:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
discussing soon
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative Hicks thank you
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
um so if if you would be um
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
will need to accept that motion I would
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
make the motion to recess
 
02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
uh that well no
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
um the motion for recess would have to
 
02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
come for me
 
02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:13.790 align:start position:0%
come for me
um

02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.770 --> 02:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:20.509 --> 02:19:20.519 align:start position:0%
further comments yeah we got some more
 
02:19:22.610 --> 02:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
down there representative
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I wanted to uh go
 
02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
back and directly address representative
 
02:19:29.330 --> 02:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
yokella's uh question slash comment
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and I think I understood where he was
 
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
coming from in his the angle when he was
 
02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
talking about the conservation uh
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
commissions and the idea that
 
02:19:40.370 --> 02:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
conservation benefits from increased
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
density I think what you were trying to
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
say is
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
we increase conservation to the extent
 
02:19:48.049 --> 02:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
that we concentrate populations so
 
02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
increasing density and already dense
 
02:19:51.889 --> 02:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
popular and are you dense areas rather
 
02:19:54.290 --> 02:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
than non-dense areas but increased
 
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
density for the most part requires
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
increasing density in non-dense areas
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that's where we run into issues
 
02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
where conservation really is a barrier
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
to increased density because for example
 
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
current use requires 10 acres
 
02:20:11.090 --> 02:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
so you can't seven does it change I
 
02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm not I'm not a member of
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you but also from a general
 
02:20:20.570 --> 02:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
conservation standpoint
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
um people who are interested in Wildlife
 
02:20:24.190 --> 02:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
Conservation something I do know about
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh that uh the idea the principle is to
 
02:20:31.849 --> 02:20:31.859 align:start position:0%
have as large areas of conservation as
 
02:20:33.889 --> 02:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
possible for wildlife populations it's
 
02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
more beneficial to have if you have the
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
same number of Acres it's more
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have all of that
 
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
contiguous rather than separated into
 
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
smaller Parcels so because that is a
 
02:20:45.010 --> 02:20:45.020 align:start position:0%
basic conservation principle
 
02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
conservation does actually present a
 
02:20:59.770 --> 02:20:59.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
I greatly appreciate the appreciate the
 
02:21:03.770 --> 02:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
correction representative
 
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:11.389 --> 02:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
so Representatives this was my thought
 
02:21:13.849 --> 02:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
we do have to
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh have disposition of this particular
 
02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:20.210 align:start position:0%
uh have disposition of this particular
Amendment

02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:21:23.530 --> 02:21:23.540 align:start position:0%
uh if it were to pass
 
02:21:28.210 --> 02:21:28.220 align:start position:0%
an amendment could be made
 
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
and the this excess session could be
 
02:21:34.849 --> 02:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
recessed to a future date I just went to
 
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
check to see which time which day room
 
02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
is going to be available we will be
 
02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
either the 17th or the 24th briefly
 
02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:45.050 align:start position:0%
either the 17th or the 24th briefly
hopefully

02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
02:21:47.050 --> 02:21:47.060 align:start position:0%
so if this were to pass
 
02:21:50.690 --> 02:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
and I called a recess somebody would be
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
able to make that
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the amendment
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
I will leave it there for the comments
 
02:22:01.969 --> 02:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman just a point of
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
clarification would it also be possible
 
02:22:09.410 --> 02:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
for you to withdraw your emotion on the
 
02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
amendment and then make the motion to
 
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
retain this bill to a future date to
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
correct the amendment and add the
 
02:22:20.929 --> 02:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
conservation I could I I'm not going to
 
02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
withdraw the motion we can
 
02:22:25.730 --> 02:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
and it wouldn't be a retain I mean we
 
02:22:29.210 --> 02:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
can retain this retain
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
is a much longer rather than recess I'm
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
just if we recess this particular
 
02:22:37.130 --> 02:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
executive session we can do it to a
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
specific date
 
02:22:41.210 --> 02:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
either next week or the week after is
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
a follow-up at that time if the
 
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
amendment does pass
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
without the language
 
02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
without the language
um

02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:02.040 align:start position:0%

02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:25.429 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh in between now and the
 
02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:30.469 align:start position:0%
uh uh in between now and the
um

02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
in between now and the uh the floor
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
an amendment very similar to the
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just did not pass very
 
02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:42.410 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just did not pass very
closely

02:25:42.410 --> 02:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
closely
 
02:25:47.809 --> 02:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
um that might had have uh been more
 
02:25:49.490 --> 02:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
supported by this committee could be
 
02:25:51.290 --> 02:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
offered as a floor Amendment on the
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
floor and Achieve that same
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
goal as the recessing to a future date
 
02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
is my understanding of that correctly
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
and correct I believe you're correct if
 
02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
we recess to his later date it could be
 
02:26:09.650 --> 02:26:09.660 align:start position:0%
done within committee
 
02:26:11.389 --> 02:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
if it
 
02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
um passes OTP it will go to the floor
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
and then a floor Amendment would be
 
02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:17.929 align:start position:0%
and then a floor Amendment would be
needed

02:26:17.929 --> 02:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:26:20.450 --> 02:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
is my understanding representative Brown
 
02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chair what's the barrier to recessing
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
this to a later date now
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's no motion you have to
 
02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
is it is it only you that can do that
 
02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
could you state the question again
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh what's the barrier to
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
just recessing this to a later date for
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
our committee there is none except we
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
have a motion on the floor okay thank
 
02:26:47.650 --> 02:26:47.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
in response to what representative Brown
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
just asked would be my understanding it
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
was my understanding and please correct
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong that had we passed this
 
02:27:02.270 --> 02:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
amendment we could recess the entire
 
02:27:05.929 --> 02:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
kitten caboodle come back and amend it
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
again just in committee under recess we
 
02:27:13.090 --> 02:27:13.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
so we're done
 
02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
with the amendment as it stands as far
 
02:27:21.469 --> 02:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
as I can see although I could be wrong
 
02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
no you're correct thank you you're
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
unless it's brought up representative
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
yokello was talking about bringing it up
 
02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
as a floorman no I I understand that and
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
I thought oh excuse me thank you yeah
 
02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
anybody else uh representative Hicks
 
02:27:41.210 --> 02:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
just quickly thank you Mr chairman um I
 
02:27:42.889 --> 02:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
do actually agree with you in principle
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
on the number of commissions and really
 
02:27:48.170 --> 02:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of us who are
 
02:27:50.690 --> 02:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
legislators to get together for things
 
02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
that we are passionate about I think
 
02:27:54.889 --> 02:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
that is a better approach than forcing
 
02:27:57.410 --> 02:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
people to sit on commissions uh that
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
being said I believe this is something
 
02:28:00.650 --> 02:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
that has
 
02:28:05.210 --> 02:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
existed previously and so I don't have a
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
problem supporting this
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
because of the issues and because it has
 
02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
existed previously but I I am fully in
 
02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
support of
 
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of commissions that
 
02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.359 --> 02:28:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:28:20.030 --> 02:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:23.570 --> 02:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you just to tack on to the
 
02:28:26.929 --> 02:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
procedural conversation so even though
 
02:28:29.570 --> 02:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
we did not pass this amendment that we
 
02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
were just discussing if the chair chose
 
02:28:34.250 --> 02:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
to recess it's not emotion it's it's
 
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
just something a chair can do we would
 
02:28:40.130 --> 02:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
have we you all really you all would
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
have time to um get a new Amendment
 
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
together that might be a compromise
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment amongst leadership for example
 
02:28:49.849 --> 02:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
so it's still I think would behoove the
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
committee to do that and perhaps if the
 
02:28:54.170 --> 02:28:54.180 align:start position:0%
chair was willing the motion could be
 
02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:56.530 align:start position:0%
chair was willing the motion could be
withdrawn

02:28:56.530 --> 02:28:56.540 align:start position:0%
withdrawn
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
well to do what you suggested
 
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Reed it would require the
 
02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
motion to be withdrawn otherwise we have
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.130 --> 02:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks one more comment um
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
other than the elimination of the
 
02:29:17.330 --> 02:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission I think that the
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
amendment was a better Amendment the
 
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
reason I didn't vote for it was because
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
of that so actually like
 
02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
the amendment with the conservation
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
better than the current bill
 
02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
just for
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
just to bring that point out
 
02:29:36.349 --> 02:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank representative Hicks
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
for that comment and I feel exactly the
 
02:29:41.770 --> 02:29:41.780 align:start position:0%
same way
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
and would be willing
 
02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
if if the chair was willing to
 
02:29:53.809 --> 02:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
compromise on the Conservation
 
02:29:53.819 --> 02:29:55.429 align:start position:0%
compromise on the Conservation
Commission

02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
I might be willing to amend my emotion
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
or withdraw my emotion
 
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
depending on how we can work that out
 
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.690 align:start position:0%
depending on how we can work that out
procedurally

02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
it would require a YouTuber withdraw
 
02:30:12.410 --> 02:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
your motion and whoever seconded it and
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
I believe we could
 
02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
work out what's
 
02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:23.570 --> 02:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative stavis then I withdraw my
 
02:30:23.580 --> 02:30:24.889 align:start position:0%
representative stavis then I withdraw my
motion

02:30:24.889 --> 02:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:30:26.330 --> 02:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
priest I will also withdraw my second
 
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
but I do have a question a procedural uh
 
02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:38.939 align:start position:0%
question if we make a motion to
 
02:30:42.889 --> 02:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
um recess this bill to a later date
 
02:30:44.929 --> 02:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's not emotion it's it's
 
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
something I can just call you can just
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%

take lunch
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%

and all of the leadership and members
 
02:32:24.889 --> 02:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
for the work we do to achieve what is
 
02:32:28.130 --> 02:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
largely a bipartisan consensus on most
 
02:32:29.929 --> 02:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
of the issues that confront us and I'm
 
02:32:31.490 --> 02:32:31.500 align:start position:0%

apologize to the deputy ranking member
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
for repeatedly mispronouncing his name
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
these many years since he was first
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
elected uh pronouncing it with indeed
 
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
four syllables instead of three in in
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
being substituting on this committee has
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
taught me the error of my ways
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%

02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative powers and
 
02:33:38.090 --> 02:33:38.100 align:start position:0%

what

02:33:48.889 --> 02:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
really okay
 
02:34:17.090 --> 02:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
02:34:20.270 --> 02:34:20.280 align:start position:0%

02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
session on 20 uh no
 
02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
SB 47

will be recessed till 10 a.m on the 24th
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:34:39.410 --> 02:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:42.410 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:34:42.410 --> 02:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.090 --> 02:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to hammer it down because
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's just in recess we have one bill
 
02:34:50.450 --> 02:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
left so
 
02:34:52.849 --> 02:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
here's the options I'm going to see a
 
02:34:55.309 --> 02:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
show of hands what we want to do
 
02:34:58.010 --> 02:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
this is going to be today this is going
 
02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:00.380 align:start position:0%
to be another bill that I will
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
recess until that same day so we're
 
02:35:04.670 --> 02:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
going to have two bills to go over I
 
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna have a lot of
 
02:35:08.030 --> 02:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on this one I'd prefer to see
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
that discussion as much as we can do
 
02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
today I know there's been a lot of work
 
02:35:15.770 --> 02:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes at least from our side
 
02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
um this there's issues with the bill
 
02:35:19.550 --> 02:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
that we want to clean up if it's to go
 
02:35:23.570 --> 02:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.090 --> 02:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
not sure how long the discussion on that
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
is going to take so the question is do
 
02:35:31.730 --> 02:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
you want to break for lunch now or do
 
02:35:33.650 --> 02:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
you want to push through
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:40.490 --> 02:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
is there anybody who wants to break for
 
02:35:44.210 --> 02:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:46.910 --> 02:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
I see three hand uh Representatives
 
02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:48.309 align:start position:0%
I see three hand uh Representatives
Davis

02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
Davis
 
02:35:50.929 --> 02:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to accomplish in
 
02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
having the conversation today as opposed
 
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
to when we recess to
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
because I think there's going to be a
 
02:36:00.410 --> 02:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion regardless of what the
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
um what the bill ends up looking like if
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment or whatever I think
 
02:36:08.270 --> 02:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:11.090 --> 02:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
bill with potential conflict so I'd like
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
to get as much of that out of the way as
 
02:36:15.770 --> 02:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
we can today at least get everybody's
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
opinion on it if you'd prefer to just do
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
it all at once next time we can also do
 
02:36:22.250 --> 02:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
that but
 
02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:26.750 align:start position:0%
that but
I'd

02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.849 --> 02:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
am I seeing people want to do it all at
 
02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
once rather than today I would prefer
 
02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
that yeah you would okay well we can do
 
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
that so I am not going to open up
 
02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:39.230 align:start position:0%
that so I am not going to open up
Deborah

02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
Deborah
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman thank you I'm not sure
 
02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:42.710 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman thank you I'm not sure
but

02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that I'd like to see a
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
consensus of how many members have
 
02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.429 align:start position:0%
consensus of how many members have
actually

02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed the Salient sections of Title
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
VII of the U.S code relative to this
 
02:36:57.830 --> 02:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill because if you don't know what that
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
it says then discussion is going to fall
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
flat on its face so what we will do
 
02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
based on the comments I'm going to ask
 
02:37:07.859 --> 02:37:09.349 align:start position:0%
based on the comments I'm going to ask
um

02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
before I recess it I'm going to ask
 
02:37:14.450 --> 02:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
Deborah because she's been doing an
 
02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:15.969 align:start position:0%
Deborah because she's been doing an
extremely

02:37:15.969 --> 02:37:15.979 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
02:37:18.889 --> 02:37:18.899 align:start position:0%
large amount of work and research on
 
02:37:18.899 --> 02:37:20.230 align:start position:0%
large amount of work and research on
this

02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have two weeks before we come back
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
and actually exec the bill we will exec
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
it unless somebody decides they want to
 
02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
retain it but I do plan on executing
 
02:37:34.130 --> 02:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
these last two bills on the 24th so at
 
02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
that whatever information Deborah that
 
02:37:40.210 --> 02:37:40.220 align:start position:0%
you have on that that anybody else has
 
02:37:44.110 --> 02:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
use the next two weeks wisely
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
I would have preferred to actually got
 
02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
some discussion going today but if the
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
will of the group is do it all at once
 
02:37:55.809 --> 02:37:55.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:59.330 --> 02:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative priests and I would also
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
encourage any
 
02:38:03.410 --> 02:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
of the members on this committee if they
 
02:38:05.210 --> 02:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
have amendments
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
to share it with the members prior to
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
the meeting so we're prepared to talk
 
02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
about them and to deal with it at that
 
02:38:15.060 --> 02:38:16.250 align:start position:0%
about them and to deal with it at that
time

02:38:16.250 --> 02:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:38:18.650 --> 02:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
I I would agree
 
02:38:22.849 --> 02:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
um and I think representative priests at
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
least the three amendments I was
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
involved with you had in your hands over
 
02:38:28.969 --> 02:38:28.979 align:start position:0%
a week ago I sent to the entire
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
committee if you didn't receive them
 
02:38:33.290 --> 02:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
it's because you've given us a bad email
 
02:38:35.929 --> 02:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
address but I sent those off at least a
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
week ago
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
so I I I try to do that represent a
 
02:38:41.750 --> 02:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
priest because there's nothing worse
 
02:38:43.730 --> 02:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
than I hate than getting an amendment
 
02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
the day before uh eight on SB 222 OLS
 
02:38:52.010 --> 02:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
didn't complete that simple one line
 
02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:52.910 align:start position:0%
didn't complete that simple one line
um

02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
that I sent them until yesterday
 
02:38:56.990 --> 02:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon when I landed from Rome and I
 
02:38:58.790 --> 02:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
immediately sent it out to everybody as
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
soon as I got it so I I attempt to do
 
02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
that and I would ask everybody to do
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
that as you know as soon as you have a
 
02:39:07.849 --> 02:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
Amendment also you know if don't don't
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
wait till the last minute
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh till don't wait a weekend six days
 
02:39:15.650 --> 02:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
from now to start doing the research or
 
02:39:17.690 --> 02:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
whatever I'd ask again Deborah to get
 
02:39:21.230 --> 02:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
your research out maybe send it to me or
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
Diane and then we can float it out to
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
everybody in the committee
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman would it be possible for
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
the minority and majority side to
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
discuss what their major concerns with
 
02:39:40.010 --> 02:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
the bill are before we recess
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
just an overview maybe what the issues
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
are so that as as I research this I can
 
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
be more thoughtful in in my approach to
 
02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
the information that I'm researching to
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit better view to
 
02:39:56.330 --> 02:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
be more open to maybe some of the
 
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
concerns that was the point of my
 
02:40:00.410 --> 02:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
statement before was whether or not we
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to begin a discussion today or
 
02:40:06.309 --> 02:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
do it all at once later I'm
 
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
ambivalent I would prefer to have it out
 
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
start now but it appears the majority
 
02:40:12.889 --> 02:40:12.899 align:start position:0%
would rather wait and do it all at once
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative kale is there anything
 
02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
stopping representative Brown from
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
meeting with his colleagues over lunch
 
02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
and talking
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
there is not
 
02:40:24.889 --> 02:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
02:40:27.849 --> 02:40:27.859 align:start position:0%
the need for commissions
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
where people should be able to get
 
02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
together and organize what they wish to
 
02:40:36.889 --> 02:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
do rather than say Hey you go and do all
 
02:40:39.410 --> 02:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
the research on this commission yes you
 
02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
can do that it's a very good point
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill representative I'm
 
02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:47.290 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill representative I'm
sorry

02:40:47.290 --> 02:40:47.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:40:49.030 --> 02:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:51.770 --> 02:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative machiotti
 
02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.319 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:41:02.330 --> 02:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
my current status has made me realize
 
02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
that we are all human beings made of
 
02:41:06.889 --> 02:41:06.899 align:start position:0%
Flesh and Blood maybe I should write a
 
02:41:09.530 --> 02:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
song about that we've been here since 10
 
02:41:14.450 --> 02:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
30 doing our work and candidly I for one
 
02:41:16.370 --> 02:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
am cooked
 
02:41:18.170 --> 02:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to have lunch with you and
 
02:41:20.690 --> 02:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
talk about it maybe even another day but
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
I prefer not to stay here in committee
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
and force you all
 
02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:28.100 align:start position:0%
for however long to talk more right now
 
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
I I yield to my humanity and to my
 
02:41:34.250 --> 02:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
colleagues from Italy
 
02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:36.550 align:start position:0%
colleagues from Italy
foreign

02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:38.809 --> 02:41:38.819 align:start position:0%
we're just going round and round now on
 
02:41:40.730 --> 02:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
what we're gonna do so uh representative
 
02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
Edward I'll give you the last word and
 
02:41:46.190 --> 02:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:41:48.770 --> 02:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea
 
02:41:50.809 --> 02:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
um in trying to
 
02:41:53.330 --> 02:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
address some of the concerns in
 
02:41:55.969 --> 02:41:55.979 align:start position:0%
opposition testimony and and things I
 
02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
was seeing that just didn't seem right
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
you literally have to sit down with the
 
02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
three sections of title eight which are
 
02:42:03.479 --> 02:42:07.570 align:start position:0%
three sections of title eight which are
1373

02:42:07.570 --> 02:42:07.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:12.110 --> 02:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
1357 and 1226 and you have to look at
 
02:42:14.570 --> 02:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
the bills side by side and try to make
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
sense of what the bill is trying to do
 
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
versus what federal law says
 
02:42:24.050 --> 02:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
and then go to the objections that were
 
02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
raised especially that of
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
um the bill forcing or coercing or
 
02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:33.530 align:start position:0%
um the bill forcing or coercing or
requiring

02:42:33.530 --> 02:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
um local law enforcement and state law
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement to enforce immigration
 
02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:40.309 align:start position:0%
enforcement to enforce immigration
detainers

02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
detainers
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
I spent 40 hours looking for where that
 
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
is in federal law and I can't find it
 
02:42:50.450 --> 02:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
so if you familiarize yourself with
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
those sections that specifically say
 
02:42:57.849 --> 02:42:57.859 align:start position:0%
federal state or local law enforcement
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
in those three sections isolate them
 
02:43:05.870 --> 02:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
understand them as they relate to the
 
02:43:08.809 --> 02:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
bill will have a fantastic discussion
 
02:43:11.150 --> 02:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Elward so what
 
02:43:15.110 --> 02:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you to do is in a brief
 
02:43:17.170 --> 02:43:17.180 align:start position:0%
one-page summary
 
02:43:20.929 --> 02:43:20.939 align:start position:0%
outline all the issues that you believe
 
02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
we need addressing I know you have been
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
talking with the sponsors about a
 
02:43:29.150 --> 02:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment if that comes to
 
02:43:31.849 --> 02:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
pass that's fine also but please send
 
02:43:35.030 --> 02:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
what you believe we should all be
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%

02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:42.250 align:start position:0%
sorry and we will get that out to the
entire

entire
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee okay so with that I will

02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:02.830 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions or
comments
