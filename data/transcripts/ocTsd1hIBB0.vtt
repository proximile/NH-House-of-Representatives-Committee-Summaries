00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
not here absent okay

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes this really helps
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
just being virtual okay that it's all
 
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:11.990 align:start position:0%
just being virtual okay that it's all
committee

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
members are there any substitutes that
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
we should be aware of
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
uh to my knowledge okay
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
all right that being the case we will
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
call up
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
house bill 541 and i will first went to
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
a previous arrangement recognize the
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative ellen reed
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
honorable members
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is on the national popular
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
vote interstate compact
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
so i will just speak very briefly as an
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
overview i know that you've
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
seen this material before this deals
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
with the electoral college the electoral
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
college is
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
a bit of an anomaly of an election
 
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
a bit of an anomaly of an election
system

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
we do not operate any other race any
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
other election in this country
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
by this method it was originally a
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
compromise in the
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
constitution when different compromises
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
were being reached in order to pass the
 
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.030 align:start position:0%
were being reached in order to pass the
constitution

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh it was a compromise between those who
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
favored like james madison a direct
 
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.750 align:start position:0%
favored like james madison a direct
election

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
very similar to how we elect every
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
single other representative
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
and those who wanted congress to elect
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
the president
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
the result that we have in modern day is
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
that one out of six when you account for
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
landslide elections one out of six
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
of our presidential elections result in
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
what is called a failed election where
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
the winner
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
of the popular vote does not actually
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
win the office this means actually in
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
recent years
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
those those voters who are in their
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
twenties now
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
um the three they have experienced three
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
presidents being elected
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
two of those presidents that they've
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
experienced being elected did not win
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
the popular vote as i said this is the
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
only race in the country
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
that is run like this i dare say that we
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
cannot fathom
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
for example running the gubernatorial
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
race like this if you can imagine the
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
equivalent it would be
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
separating new hampshire into its 10
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
respective counties
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
assigning them a number of electors
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
according to their
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
according to their population and then
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
allowing those electors
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
by county to be winner take all for
 
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.430 align:start position:0%
by county to be winner take all for
county

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
in that scenario i think it's clear
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
because rockingham county has the vast
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
majority of population that
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
rockingham county would swing every
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
almost every
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial race so back to the
 
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.910 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial race so back to the
constitution

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
this is a states rights issue in our
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
constitution article 2 section 1 it
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
states and i quote each state shall
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
appoint in a manner
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
such as the legislature thereof may
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
direct a number of electors this means
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire legislature
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the state of new hampshire get to
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
choose how we allocate
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
our electors and indeed originally all
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
of the states
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
had allocated their electors
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
proportionally um
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
i believe it was back in the 1800s i
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
want to say is nebraska don't hold me to
 
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.590 align:start position:0%
want to say is nebraska don't hold me to
that

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
not nebraska i apologize it was another
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
western state
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
figured out that if they went to winner
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
take all instead of proportional
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
allocation for the electors all of a
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
sudden the
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
candidates would spend more time because
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
their state meant
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
more and this began a kind of race
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
amongst the different states
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
to rush to make their states win or take
 
00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:17.590 align:start position:0%
to rush to make their states win or take
all

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
and now where there are only two states
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
that are still proportional that is
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
nebraska in maine
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
and the result is that we have what we
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
call battleground states
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
so in every race approximately five to
 
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.030 align:start position:0%
so in every race approximately five to
12

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
12
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
states are really the only important
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
states and we know this
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
this means that a voter in a safe state
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
their vote simply does not matter it is
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
not one person one vote
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
a republican in california that person's
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
vote does not matter
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
a democrat in texas that person's vote
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
is not does not matter because those
 
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.590 align:start position:0%
is not does not matter because those
states

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
are winner take all and they are safe um
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
this the the safe states the
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
non-battleground states account
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
for 70 percent of all the voters which
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
means 70 percent of voters
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
are essentially their votes do not
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
matter as much as voters in
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
battleground states this violates one
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
person one vote
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
now with this compact speaking
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
specifically about this compact if we
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
were to sign onto this compact as a
 
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
number of other states have already
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
nothing would change for the time being
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh states
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent i think reaching almost 200
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
electoral votes or
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
yes electoral votes almost 200 have
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
signed off already
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
we need 270 in order for this compact to
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
go into effect
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
so nothing would change for the time
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
being until the extra
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 74 i believe electoral
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
vote equivalent of states
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
sign off once that happened
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
once that does happen then we would
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
simply allocate
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
our four electors to the winner of the
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
national popular vote
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
and what this would do as would be other
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
states and what this would do is ensure
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
that whoever won the popular vote
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
across the country would in fact warning
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
the electoral
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me for four and a half minutes
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
all right i'm almost done we'd also win
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
the electoral vote
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
meaning that the candidate who won by
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
popular vote would win the presidency
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
and it would work like every other
 
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.150 align:start position:0%
and it would work like every other
election

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
in our country um so it i just want to
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
be very clear
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
that our this would not impact our
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
primary system it would not impact our
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
status as first in the nation
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
and it would not impact our selection
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
process for for electors
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
it would simply mean that our status our
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
voters in our state
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
their votes would count the same as any
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
other voter in the country there would
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
no longer be winning a state as we think
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
of it one vote in
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would be the same as a
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
vote in texas as in idaho as in
 
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
vote in texas as in idaho as in
tennessee

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
tennessee
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
all votes would be treated equally and
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
with that i will say that
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'll take questions and i'll defer to
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
the experts that i have today with me
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
i have three experts with me who will i
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
believe are prepared to speak
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
so are you are you referring questions
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
to them are you
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
going to take them i'm happy to take
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
questions myself
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
if they're technical in nature and i'm
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
unable i'm happy to defer to them as
 
00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:04.470 align:start position:0%
unable i'm happy to defer to them as
well

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
i hear none no no very much
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
how do you raise your hand
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm at the bottom of the screen at the
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
bottom of the participant panel
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side of your uh screen
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's a raised hand feature
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative gay if you speak up i'll
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
hear you if you want to ask a question
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to ask if there is
 
00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.269 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to ask if there is
any

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
other national election besides the
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
um so no this would only impact the
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
there are federal elections to be clear
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
this is the the presidential election is
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
the only one for whom the district
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
the entire country so it's the only one
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
for whom
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
the electoral college is used so this
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
impacts only the presidential election
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
it is the presidential elections already
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
but a bit of a unicorn amongst races
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
so this is merely making that election
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
work like every other election in our
 
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
work like every other election in our
country

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
but we don't have and i'm sorry i'm
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
sorry for the further question
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
okay yes so so we don't have
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
any other election to compare it to
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
that involves the entire nation
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
right our the only election in our
 
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
right our the only election in our
country

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
for whom the enti the district is the
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
entire country
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
is the president um we can compare it to
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
say other countries
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
as far as i know no other modern
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
democracy operates this way
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
um we can compare it to other races like
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
say for example the executive branch in
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
any particular state is the governor
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
no no state operates this way when they
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
elect a governor
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
we can even compare it as i said to the
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
earliest version
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
of electoral college when each of those
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
states did proportion out proportionally
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
and not winner take all in which case
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
the results
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
more closely match the national popular
 
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
more closely match the national popular
vote

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
in those days we didn't have very many
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
field elections it is only in modern
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
times where we have winner take all in
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
almost every state where we have what we
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
call field elections
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
further questions follow-up
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative gay one final
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up i promise one final
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh so so perhaps
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
this is this is a question so perhaps
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
you would be happy if it was just
 
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
you would be happy if it was just
proportional

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
if the electoral college was
 
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.949 align:start position:0%
if the electoral college was
proportional

00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
like maine and nebraska that's right
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
certainly yes yes representative thank
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question i'm glad
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
you asked that i didn't want to go into
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
detail with the timer's constraints but
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
so that would help us get closer to
 
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.269 align:start position:0%
so that would help us get closer to
mirroring

00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
mirroring
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
um what the national popular vote looks
 
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.629 align:start position:0%
um what the national popular vote looks
like

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
it is not perfect because those
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
proportion proportioning out of the
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
electoral votes goes by
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
congressional within each of those
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
districts is still winner take all
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
it does not actually count one person
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
one vote each person's vote being
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
being regardless of where they are
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
according to their district in that
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
state but it would
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
be a big step towards making it more
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh reflective of the popular vote you
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
is senator pearson here
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
senator pearson i will um allow him to
 
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.350 align:start position:0%
senator pearson i will um allow him to
speak

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%

00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay why don't you uh
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
if you like because i've met with the
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee before
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
um if if it makes sense for you i'd be
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
happy to just stick around in case there
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
are questions
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
and you can hear from folks you haven't
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
heard from before and
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh but unless i can always talk about
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
national popular vote and why i think
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's good for the country
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
if you like uh i think since we have had
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on this previously
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
uh it was some while ago however if if
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're just
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh happy to take questions i will ask
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for senator
 
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.150 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for senator
pearson

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
speak up please i may be on a different
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
and no indications are being made okay
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator uh in that case i

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
of common cause
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
and just take me a second to
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
miss wilmot you're recognized oh thank
 
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:03.669 align:start position:0%

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman uh members of the
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee my name is pam wilmott
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
i am vice president of state operations
 
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:12.789 align:start position:0%
i am vice president of state operations
at

00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh common cause which is a national
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
nonprofit with state chapters across
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
the state of the country unfortunately
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
although we have
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
6 000 members in new hampshire
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
we don't actually have an office there
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
but i'm a frequent
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
a hiker and love new hampshire and hope
 
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:33.669 align:start position:0%
a hiker and love new hampshire and hope
to

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
be moving there sometime soon so um
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
anyway uh national popular vote is
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
a priority for common cause along with
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
many other democracy and good government
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
organizations organizations like the
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
league of women voters
 
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:57.500 align:start position:0%
the american civil liberties union
 
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.350 align:start position:0%
the american civil liberties union
[Music]

00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
deimos fair vote public citizen
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
many other local conservation
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
groups and a whole list i think we're
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
pretty close to including national and
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
state organizations about 100
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
different ones and that's because
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
the way we elect the president is in
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
fact unique
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
and is been broken for a very long time
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's the only election where votes
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
are not equal throughout the district
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
a vote in a battleground state is
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
worth more than a spectator state and we
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
believe that every vote should be equal
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
in every election because these things
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
shift over time
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
i know that you know new hampshire is
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
very important for having the first
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
primary in the nation and as a small
 
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.669 align:start position:0%
primary in the nation and as a small
state

00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
having that role is very important with
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
retail politics that
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
is not the same thing in the general
 
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.950 align:start position:0%
is not the same thing in the general
election

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
and our country is
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
founded on that very principle the
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
electoral college was in fact
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
a compromise senator haines is going to
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
probably speak a little bit later he can
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
probably talk
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
more about that and in fact
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
we've elected a president and changed
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
the way we've done electors in this
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
country many
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
many different times represented
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned proportional allocation
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
that is not currently used it's actually
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
a bad
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
idea as is the district method
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
of selecting electors which we have two
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
states maine and nebraska
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
because none of them embrace the
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
principle of one person one vote
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
and none of them assure that the
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
candidate with the most
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
votes wins and none of the other
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
two systems or three mean that
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
every vote and every election and every
 
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.350 align:start position:0%
every vote and every election and every
state

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
is important so we believe in
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
citizen participation and citizen
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
participation in elections
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i think there's nothing that you
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
could do or we could do as a country
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
fix that as well as add to the security
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
of our election system and
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
implementing a national popular vote um
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
we have i think as as the representative
 
00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
we have i think as as the representative
mentioned

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh we are 15 states in the district of
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
columbia with 196 electoral votes
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
maine and vermont i'm sorry
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
vermont and massachusetts connecticut
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
rhode island are all states that have
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
passed it
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
and we hope that uh we'll
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
get many many more in the years to come
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is a system that the public
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
knows is broken
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
that they want to change they've wanted
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
change for a long time
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
and this gives us an opportunity to do
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
that in a constitutional and effective
 
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.909 align:start position:0%
that in a constitutional and effective
way

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
so i think i'll stop there and uh i know
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
you're very busy and these remote
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
hearings are a little tricky so
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you miss wilmotter are there any

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
let's see is senator haynes available
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
former senator haynes i'm here
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
talk to you
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna come at this a little bit
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
differently than uh both senator pearson
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
and ms wilmot did
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
i want to come at the concept of the
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
national popular interstate compact
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
from a conservative perspective a little
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of my background
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
i was in the california legislature for
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
14 years i was the senate republican
 
00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:11.190 align:start position:0%
14 years i was the senate republican
whip

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
whip
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
i was the chairman of the american
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
legislative exchange council
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
in the year 2000 i was also the chairman
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the senate constitutional amendments
 
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.390 align:start position:0%

committee

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
in california i first got involved in
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
electoral college reform
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of my experience in the
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
george w
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
bush campaign i was one of the first 25
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
elected officials in the country in
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
february of 1999
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
to endorse then governor bush for
 
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.470 align:start position:0%
to endorse then governor bush for
president

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
only to find after he looked me in the
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
face and said he was going to campaign
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
in california in 2000 to find out in
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
september of 2000
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
they had walked away from the state that
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
started getting me looking at
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
electoral college reform my first effort
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
was looking at a congressional district
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
system that's a system in effect
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
in maine and in nebraska i walked away
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
from that because i didn't think that
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
would solve what i
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
what i call the major problem of winner
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
take all laws it is important to
 
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.430 align:start position:0%
take all laws it is important to
understand

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
that the national popular vote
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
interstate compact does not eliminate
 
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.190 align:start position:0%
interstate compact does not eliminate
the

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
the electoral college in fact it uses
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
the language of article two section one
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
to allow the state uh to in it as an
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
exercise in federalism for the state to
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
make the determination
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
of what's in the state's best interest
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
and the challenge i came to it as a
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
conservative is i believe
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
neither party most conservatives in this
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
country live in what i call the big l
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
which is the mountain and midwest states
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the south
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
um and in those states
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
neither party addresses the concerns of
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
conservatives because they are in
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
safe most of them are in safe republican
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
states and or
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
in safe democrat states and their vote
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
don't matter it doesn't matter as in my
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
case i'm a republican in california the
 
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.110 align:start position:0%
case i'm a republican in california the
least

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
relevant uh voter in the country is a
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
republican in california
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
and so i wanted to do something to get
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
conservative values
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
and uh get parties talking about
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
conservative values and addressing
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
conservative concerns literally the
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
problem is not the electoral college in
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
fact preserving the electoral college is
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
an important thing
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
because right now article 1 section 4 of
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
puts election law in the hands of
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
the state legislatures if you ever
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated the electoral college you'd
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
knock defenses off of article 1 section
 
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:30.470 align:start position:0%
knock defenses off of article 1 section
4

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
4
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
which has been very very narrowly
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
interpreted by the supreme court
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
and congress could then step in and
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
start writing election law and i tell my
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
democrat friends that you don't want
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
republicans writing election law because
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
they would write the law to say you need
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
three forms of id
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
and a concealed carry permit before you
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to vote
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh by republican friends i say you don't
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
want democrats doing that because they
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
would right
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
say as long as you can still read
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's name on their uh
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
on their headstone they'd be allowed to
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
vote so bottom line on the thing is you
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
want to keep election law in the hands
 
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.230 align:start position:0%
want to keep election law in the hands
of

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
the state legislatures and preserving
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
the electoral college
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
is worth that interestingly enough the
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
winner-take-all law that is in effect in
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
48 of the 50 states
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
was actually opposed by james madison if
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the constitutional
 
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.789 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the constitutional
convention

00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
convention
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
they took 30 votes over 22 days on how
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
to elect the president united states and
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
they couldn't reach an agreement
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
when it was all said and done this was
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
the compromise they came up with
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
but of those 30 votes in those 22 days
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
none of them was the winner take all law
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
one of them was legislative appointments
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
which six or seven states had after
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh it was turned down in the uh
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
and then enacted in states others had
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
governor appointments
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
others had electoral college districts
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
as opposed to congressional districts
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
all of these things were voted on but
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
turned down in the constitutional
 
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.830 align:start position:0%
turned down in the constitutional
convention

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
convention
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
pardon me four and a half minute warning
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
anyhow just kind of let you know i
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
believe there are good solid
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
conservative reasons uh to vote or to to
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
to allow the vote in all uh 50 states
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
make every single voter in every single
 
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:07.510 align:start position:0%
make every single voter in every single
state

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
important in every single election i
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
think it's good for the conservative
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
movement and i think that's what's good
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you senator are there any
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%

audience the attendee
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh you you may recognize mr parnell i i
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
would i would reiterate that he will
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
have five minutes as all other speakers
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
just a sec i i was trying to lower his
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
hand and i um
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately cut off his speaking
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
ability now
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
all right are we okay i'm on we're good
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and i will keep this brief um
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
i spoke
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
uh last year at uh committee hearing on
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
this so i think a lot of you
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
may be familiar with some of the things
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
that i've said in the past so i'll just
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
reiterate a few of those and maybe talk
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
about a few other things that have been
 
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.630 align:start position:0%
about a few other things that have been
raised

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems with
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
national popular vote is just
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
that it relies on the cooperation of
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
non-member states
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
in order to obtain the necessary vote
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
totals the reality is there is
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
no actual official national popular vote
 
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.789 align:start position:0%
no actual official national popular vote
count

00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
count
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh what npv tries to do is sort of
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
cobble together vote counts
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
from some states that are going to be
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
fully willing and other states that
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit resistant
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
and because each state is in charge of
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
its own processes and timelines
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh there are is a substantial likelihood
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
of there being problems in terms of
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
obtaining vote counts
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
from other states and it may not be
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
states being obstinate
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
it may be uh just a state has had some
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
natural disaster like what happened with
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
new york in 2012
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
when they submitted something called
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
their certificate of ascertainment which
 
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.230 align:start position:0%
their certificate of ascertainment which
is

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say a source of vote totals
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
that npv
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
has identified as being a source that
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
can be used
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
to sort of skip over a larger dispute on
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
this topic
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the moment but anyways that
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
certificate was missing about 415
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
000 votes under national popular vote
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
the vote totals on that certificate
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
still would have had to have been used
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're coming into our first covid
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
election of course
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
i think that the chance and likelihood
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
of there being
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
significant delays in states being able
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
to report their full
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
and accurate vote counts is there's a
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
pretty high chance that there's going to
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
be problems with that
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
and under npv any problem in any other
 
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
and under npv any problem in any other
state

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
is going to have significant uh impact
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
um real quickly just getting back to a
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
couple of things that i've heard
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
um actually the very first presidential
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
election we did have some states
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
under the winner take all system
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
maryland and pennsylvania
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's actually in the book published by
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
national popular vote as well as other
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
sources of course
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
and the the statement that you wouldn't
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
elect your governor this way
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's true and the reason is because
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not a federation
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
composed of its counties your counties
 
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.029 align:start position:0%
composed of its counties your counties
are

00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the state of new
 
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.549 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the state of new
hampshire

00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
whereas the united states of america is
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
in fact a federation of states they are
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
independent sovereign nations that have
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
joined into a federation
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
and when you have federations whether
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're political federations
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
or you know civic federations this is
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually fairly typical for what you
 
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.630 align:start position:0%
actually fairly typical for what you
find

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
in fact very few nations actually elect
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
their chief executive
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
by direct elections most of them have
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
some sort of a two-step
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
process usually in a parliamentary form
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh and and so there while this is unique
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
in the united states of america to have
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
an electoral college on the national
 
00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
an electoral college on the national
scene

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
scene
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know ours looks a little bit
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
different than germany's and germany
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
looks a little bit different
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
than the united kingdom's and all these
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
other nations but
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly common type of setup
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
and in fact many nations democratic
 
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.110 align:start position:0%
and in fact many nations democratic
nations

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
nations
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
in recent decades have in fact had the
 
00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:46.389 align:start position:0%
in recent decades have in fact had the
second

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
place party or party coalition
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
have their leader become the prime
 
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.110 align:start position:0%
have their leader become the prime
minister

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
minister
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
of their nation so we're not quite the
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
outlier that maybe
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
has been suggested and finally i'll just
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
go and conclude with this
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
national popular vote i don't think is
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
actually a solution to the winner take
 
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:06.789 align:start position:0%
actually a solution to the winner take
all

00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
problem winner take all was adopted for
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
it has its pluses it has its minuses but
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
alternatives that new hampshire or any
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
other state can adopt
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
that not only would reflect the will of
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
the voters of new hampshire
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
in some way shape or form but perhaps
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
just as importantly
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
it does not require any state to wait
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
around for
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
years or possibly decades or maybe even
 
00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:34.629 align:start position:0%
years or possibly decades or maybe even
never

00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
for it to go into effect if winner take
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
all is
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
in fact the problem that you wish to
 
00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.030 align:start position:0%
in fact the problem that you wish to
address

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
then there are alternatives like the
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
congressional district system
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh some sort of proportional system or a
 
00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.550 align:start position:0%
uh some sort of proportional system or a
threshold

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
system and i'd be happy to talk about
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
any of those i'm not necessarily
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
advocating for any of those they like
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
anything else have their pluses and have
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
their minuses
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
but there's no reason for you to wait to
 
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.190 align:start position:0%
but there's no reason for you to wait to
solve

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
solve
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
what you might think of as the winner
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
take all problem
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
you have that within your power you know
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
maybe not right now headed into the 2020
 
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:09.829 align:start position:0%
maybe not right now headed into the 2020
election

00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
but certainly before 2024 you can solve
 
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.430 align:start position:0%
but certainly before 2024 you can solve
this

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
if you want to without having to wait
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
for other states
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
to come on to this compact as well so
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions at this
 
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.670 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions at this
point

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
is there any questions for the gentleman
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
hearing none thank you very much you're
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
very welcome and i will close
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
the section of these mr chairman i hate
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
to interrupt
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
but uh mr senator pearson from vermont
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
all right senator pearson what did you
 
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.190 align:start position:0%
all right senator pearson what did you
have

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
you indicated you didn't want to speak
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
any further but go ahead
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
wait just a sec i need to um
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh find him again oh his hand is down
 
00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.550 align:start position:0%
uh find him again oh his hand is down
actually

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay did did you have it what's up
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry there we go hi i i just
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
i i really have to comment that it is
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
complete fiction that there's no such
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
thing as a count
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
mr parnell has asserted this over and
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
over but he ignores that
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
every state's result is a public result
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
in fact they're public at the precinct
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
level there's no mystery
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
and the idea that uh something like new
 
00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.510 align:start position:0%
and the idea that uh something like new
york

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
york
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to get into you know a
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
call of duty
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
um at this point so um
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
just a factual factual mistake that i
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct but thank you
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you is there anyone further who
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
house bill 541 hearing none
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
we will move next to
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 554 is there anyone who
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
i i see representative bergeron has his
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized uh just
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh were we going to execute these bills
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh after
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on each one or are we
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
we were going to do that until i read in
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
the statement i read
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh to you a few minutes ago that it said
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
no an executive session will follow the
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
work session
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
i interpret that as meaning we have to
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
take them up all at the end
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i didn't listen to all of your
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh opening remarks
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
it does say that and that's when i
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
decided we were going to do everything
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
so that that be i should have probably
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
made that clear representative bergeron
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh we will move therefore to house bill
 
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.390 align:start position:0%
uh we will move therefore to house bill
554.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
554.
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who wishes to speak on
 
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i would also say that there
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
were some there's at least one member of
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
two members of the committee who weren't
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
here for the hearings on
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh these bills and so that was one
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
reason i decided to give people a little
 
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.069 align:start position:0%
reason i decided to give people a little
leeway

00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
leeway
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
no one should assume that future work
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
sessions of the
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee at least while i am chair are
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to involve
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh this stability and there's also the
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
rather unusual circumstances in which we
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
find ourselves
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 728 and i do have indication
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
people wishing to speak on that and i
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative reed thank you can you
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
yes i can hear all of you i can hear all
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
the committee members
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay i am i'm not a committee member but
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
i do appreciate
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
um the time to present before you mr
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
chair and all of the committee members
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
um so again this is something that
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
you've seen a few times i will give you
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
a brief overview i have a number of
 
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.390 align:start position:0%
a brief overview i have a number of
experts

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
experts
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
who are willing to go in more detail on
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that the committee
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
has raised
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
before and and has expressed they would
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
like more information about
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i think i've mentioned as i've been
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
before you many times i teach american
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
government and when i teach american
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
government to my students
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
i talk about the evolution of democracy
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
in fact our founding fathers
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh felt very very strongly that
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
democracy was going to be the end
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
ultimate result of every um political
 
00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:38.230 align:start position:0%
ultimate result of every um political
system

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
because that was the tendency of the
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
human nature
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
to go towards uh not not democracy
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh any kind democracy but specifically
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative democracy what we refer
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
to as a republic
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
and when we have a republic a
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative democracy it requires
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
elections now at the time the election
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
system that our founders gave us
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
known as first past the post was
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
relatively new and progressive and um
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
maybe even radical in some senses but it
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
was the best that they had it was the
 
00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:09.990 align:start position:0%
was the best that they had it was the
most

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
democratic method they had of of um
 
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.349 align:start position:0%
democratic method they had of of um
tallying

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
tallying
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
the will of the electorate the problem
 
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:16.870 align:start position:0%
the will of the electorate the problem
with

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
first past the post is something that
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
the founders actually
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
um in writing and federalist essays
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
warned against which is
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
that it leads to factions madison wrote
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
extensively as did other founders
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
about the evils of factions we call it
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
today parties
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
but they really did not want us to have
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
um parts at all but
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
especially a two-party system which
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
first passed the post
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
actually lends us towards most people in
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
fact hate
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a two-party system
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
in effect because they see the divisive
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
negative polarization that um that
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
has become of our country because of the
 
00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:54.870 align:start position:0%
has become of our country because of the
polarization

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
polarization
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
two parties and the fact that in an
 
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.990 align:start position:0%
two parties and the fact that in an
election

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
um people are not free to simply vote
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
their conscience or vote for the person
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
they think that has
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
the best ideas they are essentially
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
forced into one of the two parties
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
because any other vote for any
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
independent or third party candidate
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
is seen as a throwaway vote in fact
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
one third of all voters or over a third
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
of voters consider themselves
 
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.510 align:start position:0%
of voters consider themselves
independents

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
independents
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
or third party but again they are not
 
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.630 align:start position:0%
or third party but again they are not
free

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
to um to vote for who they want because
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
they have to engage in this kind of
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
strategic voting because of this spoiler
 
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.470 align:start position:0%
strategic voting because of this spoiler
effect

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
if they throw away their vote on a third
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
party candidate it gives
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the person they really don't want an
 
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
the person they really don't want an
advantage

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
so this has led to negative campaigning
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
this kind of fear mongering between oh
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
you have to vote for my person even if
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
that person isn't
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
your preference because we're afraid of
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
the other party
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's also led because of all this
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
negativity and polarization
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the fact that people can't really
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
vote their conscience it's led to a lot
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
of voter apathy and
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
decreased turnout um so this is exactly
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
the opposite of what our founders
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
wanted for our country so the system
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
um actually solves all of those problems
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
that i just laid out
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
it solves the spoiler effect and
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
strategic voting
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
because it gives more choices it because
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
it offers more
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
level playing field to all of the
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
candidates it allows every single vote
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
to count
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
equally it produces
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
the highest resolution picture of what
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
the electorate actually wants and it
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
finds the candidate that has the most
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
overall absolute support
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
and because of all this it decreases
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
negative campaigning everywhere that
 
00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:37.750 align:start position:0%
negative campaigning everywhere that
it's

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
been instituted and it depolarizes
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
politics and it also promotes voter
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
turnout and engagement
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
because people feel because they know
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
they feel like their vote actually
 
00:42:49.839 --> 00:42:50.470 align:start position:0%
they feel like their vote actually
matters

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
so really briefly i'm going to go over
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
how it works in general again i have
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
experts that will go
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
more into details but as a voter it's
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
highly highly intuitive and simple
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
you get a ballot where instead of just
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
choosing one you actually rank your
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
preferences we can all do this when it
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
comes to maybe our favorite flavor of
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
ice cream
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
i can say vanilla then followed by
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
cookie dough then
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
chocolate for example and
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
in what we call single member districts
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is the majority of races where you
 
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.349 align:start position:0%
this is the majority of races where you
have

00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
one winner any race where you have one
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
winner it works exactly like
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
a runoff election only it happens
 
00:43:24.319 --> 00:43:25.270 align:start position:0%
a runoff election only it happens
instantly

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
instantly
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
so you're probably already familiar with
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
runoff elections but just as an actual
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
example this is how
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
us the we the state house elects
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
a speaker of the house so when we
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
when we have uh more than uh two
 
00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:40.630 align:start position:0%
when we have uh more than uh two
candidates

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
the candidate with the lowest number of
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
votes uh gets eliminated and we all vote
 
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:45.990 align:start position:0%
votes uh gets eliminated and we all vote
again

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
from the remaining options so that's
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what this is
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
only uh it happens instantly because
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
further elections runoff election result
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
their run-off election choices are
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
actually already recorded on that first
 
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:57.990 align:start position:0%
actually already recorded on that first
ballot

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
so all of those runoff elections can be
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
done without a new election being called
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so uh the major questions that i've
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
heard from the committee before
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
is how is this going to be done with
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts in fact
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
multimedia districts where we have
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
multiple winners like new hampshire
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
state house
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
districts it is actually a boon um
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
your time is up thank you very much are
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
there any questions for representative
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
reid from members of the committee
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
let's see representative porter's hand
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
is up representative porter you're
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i admit that i'm
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of the committee members who wasn't
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
here for the hearing on this although
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
i have heard it in the past the question
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee a constituent made to me i was
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
assured that the
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
the machines that we have currently in
 
00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:55.109 align:start position:0%
the machines that we have currently in
hillsborough

00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
hillsborough
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
could be used to count these um
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
these ballots is that actually a fact or
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
will there be a need for special
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
equipment to count
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
and if so where does that money come
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
from to buy those special equipment
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question i'm
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
so happy that you asked it
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
so this is the overall implementation
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
issue that i did want to address
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is the secretary
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
of state's office is looking into
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
purchasing new
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
machines for the entire state and in
 
00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:26.630 align:start position:0%
machines for the entire state and in
fact

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
of all the machines that they are
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
looking at all of them are ranked choice
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
voting ready incompatible or rather
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
they're all compatible
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
the one that seems to be the favorite of
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
the office is the dominion
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
model and that one is actually
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
specifically ranked choice voting
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
ready so it is absolutely designed but
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
they all are compatible they all
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
put out a file known as a cvr
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
that actually is makes it easy to
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
tabulate with open source software
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
i will say that so on the town level
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
nothing would change
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
the clerks and the moderators would all
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
do everything exactly the same there's
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
no additional work for the towns
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
the only thing that would have to happen
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
is in towns with
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
these machines they would have couriers
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
take the memory cards because we do not
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
want machines hooked up to the internet
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
so they take the memory cards to a
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
central location in towns with
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
hand counts they take they courier the
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
ballots to a centralized location all
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is done by the secretary of state
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and that is that centralized location
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
that under the security stick
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
is where um all of this would be
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
tabulated with open source software is
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
free is completely transparent
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
um and maine has already done this so in
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
maine i think
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
because the secretary of state maine
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
dunlap wanted to
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
kind of be conservative about the cost
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
he estimated that the cost of going over
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
to ranked choice voting would be around
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
a little north of 1 million in fact when
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
they implemented it again that major
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
part of that cost was the querying of
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
the ballots and the memory cards uh it
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
ended up being a little
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
i think it was just a teeny bit over a
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and they were
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
able to do it in three months
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
so i do have another expert who can talk
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
more at length about the experience in
 
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
more at length about the experience in
maine

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to answer your question and
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
talk about implementation
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
there i have a follow-up mr chair
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative porter
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
so if i understood right and i might not
 
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:24.950 align:start position:0%
so if i understood right and i might not
have

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
we would not have the results the night
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
of the election then the
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
the cards would go someplace else to be
 
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.230 align:start position:0%
the cards would go someplace else to be
tabulated

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
tabulated
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
so as i understand it the the most
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
of a delay that would exist would be
 
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:38.710 align:start position:0%
of a delay that would exist would be
from

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
the delay that would exist the machine
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
the the high speed
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
scanner which would be rented for very
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
low cost a few thousand dollars
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
in maine rinse these as well those are
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
only for the hand count towns
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
the rest are just memory cards and all
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
of the computation is done relatively
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
instantly so the really the only delay
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
is in the time it takes to courier the
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
ballads or memory cards from the various
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
towns so if you take the furthest town
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
away from concord
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
and do the courier time you're looking
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
at a delay of several hours
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
not days um and indeed a lot of races
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
still to this day
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
right now do not get certified because
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're either too close or what or what
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
have you
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
um that night but in general we would
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
have results that night it would might
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
be a few hour delay and we can look to
 
00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:25.750 align:start position:0%
be a few hour delay and we can look to
maine

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
and their results to kind of confirm
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
is ms tiana coleman available thank you
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative reed
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representing new hampshire
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
independent voters
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
she is i will um find her in the list
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me all right
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely i can
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
great thank you for having me
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to talk a little bit
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
about how ranked choice voting is very
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
widely accepted and used
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
both as a nonpartisan reform measure and
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
as legally accepted as well so first of
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
all i just wanted to say that it's
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
been tried and tested in many places
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's used statewide
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
in maine now as you know for their
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
federal elections and for all of their
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
primary elections
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's both state and federal it's also
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
used in local elections in 11 states in
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
um it's used in many of the major cities
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's used for military and overseas bell
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's an additional six
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
states it's been used in the 2020
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries in four states
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
and it's gaining widespread support
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
with various ballot measures across the
 
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.950 align:start position:0%
with various ballot measures across the
country

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
the most prominent one being
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts which will be on their
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
november 2020 ballot
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
as a ballot measure there are 500
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
organizations and several counties that
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
also use it with a lot of success so
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
um it's something that's gaining a lot
 
00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:02.549 align:start position:0%
um it's something that's gaining a lot
of

00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
respect and it's kind of a reform for
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
our time so i think it's something that
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
you should definitely consider
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's also a non-partisan reform it
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
really does not benefit
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
a certain ideology or certain party if
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
you remember right i have been
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
a republican chair in the county before
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
i am now an independent
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i work with a lot of democrats and
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
this is definitely
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
a reform that should be
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
widely accepted by republicans democrats
 
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:31.829 align:start position:0%
widely accepted by republicans democrats
independents

00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
independents
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
third parties everyone it simply helps
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
the people
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
it simply helps the people who have the
 
00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:38.870 align:start position:0%
it simply helps the people who have the
most

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
support so in our democratic republic
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
we should want our representatives to be
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
picked by a majority of their
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
constituency and not by a small minority
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what rank choice
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
voting does
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
um in multi-member districts it would be
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
a majority of seats
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
that would go to the constituents with
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
the majority in a minority of seats
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
would go to those who have a minority
 
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.430 align:start position:0%
would go to those who have a minority
voice

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
voice
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
in areas where it's mostly republican it
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
would help them in areas where it's
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
mostly democrat it would probably help
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
them if there's an area that's mostly
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
independent it would probably help them
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
so it's not really meant to help any
 
00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
so it's not really meant to help any
particular

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
constituency and what it does is it
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
protects the voice of the majority
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
without trampling on the voice of the
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
minority it gives both
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
those in the majority and in the
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
minority more voice and more choice
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
um it helps us so that our winners are
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
not a fluke
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
due to vote splitting but that they are
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
actually represent
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
who the voters truly want um
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
next we just wanted to go over the
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of rank choice voting
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
um in maine there was a constitutional
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
challenge and it's been challenged in
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
other states as well
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
and every time it's been found
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional by the u.s constitution
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
the first circuit court of appeals
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
rejected an appeal
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
of their district court's um
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
case that declared that it was perfectly
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
constitutional meaning that
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
the first circuit agreed that it's that
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's constitutional
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
they said that nothing in the nothing in
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
the us constitution would
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
say that ranked choice voting violates
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
the voting rights act
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
nothing would say that it nothing would
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
require a first pass
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
the post requirement um it nothing
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
violates the equal protection clause
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
and nothing violates the one-person
 
00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.109 align:start position:0%
and nothing violates the one-person
one-vote

00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
one-vote
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
concept so it's it's as far as the u.s
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
constitution goes
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's completely constitutional in fact i
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
would note that there was a case
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh in michigan where the justice
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
department brought
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
a voting rights lawsuit against
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
them because they were using an at-large
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
election and it was discriminatory
 
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.150 align:start position:0%
election and it was discriminatory
against

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
black people and not having as much of a
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
voice and they actually
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
settled the case by promising to
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
institute ranked choice voting
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
because then that would be more fair so
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting is actually
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
a better reform makes things better um
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
some of you may have asked about the
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
plurality provision in new hampshire's
 
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.790 align:start position:0%
plurality provision in new hampshire's
constitution

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
um it is similar to maine's plurality
 
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.910 align:start position:0%
um it is similar to maine's plurality
provision

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
and um a few things you need to know
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
about that is that
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
what the main supreme court decided was
 
00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.150 align:start position:0%
what the main supreme court decided was
only

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
a a it was non-binding precedent
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
it would it is not relevant to any of
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
our federal elections
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
so we only have a plurality provision
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
four and a half minute morning
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay it's only relevant to state
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
elections for governor and for
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
executive council state senate state
 
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.349 align:start position:0%
executive council state senate state
house

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
and so you could still do federal
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
elections without any problem not to
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
mention that it's not a binding
 
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.109 align:start position:0%
mention that it's not a binding
precedent

00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
precedent
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
it would need to still be adjudicated on
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
the merits and
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
in many cases plurality is interpreted
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
as most votes cast
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
which would make it completely apply
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
because ranked choice voting
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
can be a method of arriving at a
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
plurality winner
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
the time is up man thank you
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for ms coleman
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
hearing none pam do you have any
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
indication of any
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions from this committee
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think i can hear you okay is
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
that good now
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes mr fan you are recognized okay good
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
chair cody and the committee um my name
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
is howard fain i will be addressing
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting in the context of
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's multi-member districts
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
i also want to say there was a bit in
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
this um technical world of
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
of a snafu and and the slides that were
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
going to accompany these comments aren't
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
in front of you
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i'll briefly describe them in some
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
key circumstances
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
so um new hampshire not only has the
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
largest state legislative chamber in the
 
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.789 align:start position:0%
largest state legislative chamber in the
country

00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
the number and size of its multi-member
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
districts dwarfed those in the nine
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
other states that have any at all
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
and the slide would have reminded
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
everyone that we have 99
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
um a multi-member districts totaling 295
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
just shy of three-fourths of the seats
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
um house of representatives chamber
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
and then this unique configuration of
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
representatives provides a unique
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity through the use of
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
multi-winner ranked choice voting
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
to allow most new hampshire voters to
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
elect a representative of their choice
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
wherever they happen to live and the
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
chart that would have been on the screen
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
refers to the 106 um
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
two member representatives from 53 two
 
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
two member representatives from 53 two
member

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
districts uh the various configurations
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
and including there's a six
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
a seven and eight nine ten and eleven
 
00:55:54.079 --> 00:55:55.030 align:start position:0%
a seven and eight nine ten and eleven
seat

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
um uh uh
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts and so that
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
figures into the the stats we're going
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
to look at about how this plays out
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
so the next thing was fair vote um their
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
page is called rcv 101
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
on their site and of course they're the
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
national clearinghouse on all things rcv
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
i want to quote what they say about the
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
multi-member when used to elect more
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
than one candidate like city council
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
state legislatures or even congress rcv
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
is a form of fair representation voting
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
which more accurately represents the
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
full spectrum of voters
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is also called sometimes
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
proportional rcv
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
it means a party that wins the majority
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
of votes wins the majority of seats
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
now that has not always been the case
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
under the current block voting method
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
used in the multi-member districts
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then the distortions between votes
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
one and seats one
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
within these multi-member districts has
 
00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:48.150 align:start position:0%
within these multi-member districts has
contributed

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
contributed
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
its share to large-scale majority flips
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
based only on modest shifts in votes and
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
the chart that would have been there is
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
just the most two recent flips
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
where about three and a half percent of
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
change in votes
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
has resulted in 15 percent
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
change in seats and this has a
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
significant effect in polarization and
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
and it disrupts long-term policy-making
 
00:57:13.119 --> 00:57:16.309 align:start position:0%
and it disrupts long-term policy-making
objectives

00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
so um and the next slide would have been
 
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.349 align:start position:0%
so um and the next slide would have been
um

00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
about the new hampshire's uh lowest in
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
the country representation ratio one to
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
thirty three hundred
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
the other side of the charts has has
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
states with up to over 100 000 per
 
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.710 align:start position:0%
states with up to over 100 000 per
resident

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
resident
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
in representation yet this opportunity
 
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.230 align:start position:0%
in representation yet this opportunity
presented

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
by electing multiple representatives at
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
once and that is an opportunity
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
for diverse representation of interest
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
is turned on its head by the incidence
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
of one-party sweeps
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
caused by the current block voting
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
system so a sweep for one party bits
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
remember is a shutout for the other
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
and that's before considering voters who
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
would prefer to be represented by minor
 
00:57:54.319 --> 00:57:54.870 align:start position:0%
would prefer to be represented by minor
party

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
or independent candidates if they could
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
be so when you apply several metrics to
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire representative results
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the mmds the
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts show
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
just as much evidence of partisan
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
ticketing voting as
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
all the other state and federal
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
elections in the state which is to say a
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
great deal
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
since the re-force of the votes to cease
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
the the three-fourths of the votes to
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
seats distortion
 
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
is comes from mmds three-fourths of the
 
00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:21.670 align:start position:0%
is comes from mmds three-fourths of the
solution

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
for each 3 300 new hampshire residents
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
can come directly from adopting
 
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.549 align:start position:0%
can come directly from adopting
proportional

00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
rcv as part of this ranked choice voting
package

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
package
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the next slide i would have shown you
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
that one-party sweeps are increasing
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
in just the last four elections under
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
this current districting plan
 
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's increasing from 63.4
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
of all um multi-member districts our
 
00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:46.390 align:start position:0%
of all um multi-member districts our
sweeps

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
sweeps
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
then in the um low 70s in the next two
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
and up to 79.8 percent in 2018.
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
so when you look at these in the
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
republican democratic shares you'd see
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
that in democratic years
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
the democrats have more sweeps in the
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
republican years they're more
 
00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.430 align:start position:0%
republican years they're more
republicans

00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
but both mean that ever increasing
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
numbers of voters are unable to elect a
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative of their choice
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
just because of where they live so even
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
from competing lawn signs on the same
 
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.069 align:start position:0%
from competing lawn signs on the same
block

00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
block
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
we know that republicans live and vote
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
in democratic districts and we know that
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
democrats live and vote in republican
 
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.150 align:start position:0%
democrats live and vote in republican
districts

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
there are districts that have flipped
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
from one party sweeping in one election
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
to the other sweeping in the very next
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
one a hunt fully 111 seats in 38
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts have experienced
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
four consecutive one-party sweeps under
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
this district and plan
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
since 2012 by the way four and a half
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
minute warning sir
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and so proportional rcb
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
for multi-member districts
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
will mean that the people of new
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire will always be able to you
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
know look behind the purpleness
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
and find out who wants you know who
 
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
people really want and proportionally
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
allocate them within these multi-memory
 
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.349 align:start position:0%
allocate them within these multi-memory
districts

00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
they're like with the single members
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
there's no spoilers
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
um and people vote their true
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
preferences but i'll also add
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
even gerrymandering disappears in the
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts you could keep
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
the exact same
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh map and although you won't because
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
the census
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
population shifts will occur but
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
everyone would get their fair share and
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
everyone would get a fair deal even
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
under this current map
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it's just good to know that there's
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
a you have a unique opportunity in the
 
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.150 align:start position:0%
a you have a unique opportunity in the
nation

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
nation
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
using ranked choice voting to address
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
fair representation
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
within the multi-member districts thank
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
you very much for your time
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr friend are there any
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the committee
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
i see miss representative griffin has
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
her hand up representative griffin
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
you're recognized thank you mr chair
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that a simple
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
numerical vote tally is not
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
an effective representation of people's
 
01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:56.309 align:start position:0%
an effective representation of people's
wills

01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
wills
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
i would i am saying that block voting
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
when um everyone gets as many votes as
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
seats is an ineffective method of
 
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
seats is an ineffective method of
representation

01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
i would think that if you have a um 55
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
for a group of one a party of candidates
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
from one party and 45 percent in fairly
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
partisan ticket voting
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
um from another party um and and and one
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
party sweeps
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
with that amount uh all the seats eight
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
seats 11 seats four seats
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
five seats yes um i am saying that the
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
method of block voting
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the multi-member districts is not an
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
effective means of representing all of
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
the people within that district and
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
ranked choice voting
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
proportional ranked choice voting can
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representative
 
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.950 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representative
griffin

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
apparently no thank you mr chair in f
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
follow up so are you presuming
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
that people are you presuming the vote
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
of a person by virtue of the result
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
because it would seem to me your
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
conclusion and your reference to block
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
voting would require an
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
assumption that in fact everyone is
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
voting as you
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
say it um and while there might have
 
01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:22.230 align:start position:0%
say it um and while there might have
been

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
some i'm just pointing out that from a
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
historical perspective because you
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
looked at some prior elections
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
there did used to be um
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
the practice in this state of being able
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
to simply check a block off to vote for
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
everybody in a particular party perhaps
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
contributing to the sweep that you refer
 
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.789 align:start position:0%
contributing to the sweep that you refer
to

01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
um that ability no longer exists
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
i act i'm sorry um are you finished i
 
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.870 align:start position:0%
i act i'm sorry um are you finished i
apologize

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative griffin yes i keep
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
mute myself so i don't have any
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
background noise and it makes it harder
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay mr faint yes i'm sorry if i jumped
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
in too soon um
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
yes i have been quantifying all the data
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
from these four elections under the
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
district plan
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
quantifying the bloc voting even without
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
that option for
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
for for straight ticket voting and you
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
can compare it
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
to the um comparison election in
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
governor especially which happens every
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
you can compare it um through the
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
average of the votes
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
based on the number of candidates you
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
compare it to the two highest there are
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
very many
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
there are several metrics that we are
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
developing to document
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
that the existence of partisan voting is
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
extremely strong
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
how much variance there is within the
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
slate of candidates within a given party
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
we are waiting for the 2020 election
 
01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.069 align:start position:0%
we are waiting for the 2020 election
results

01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
um coming up in a couple of months to
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
add to this database
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll produce a report
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
um explaining how we can
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
identify that partisan black voting
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
nature and i will call it
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
significant and we will make all those
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh all that data available as soon as we
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
add 2020 in
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
and i hope that answers your question
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
that it's it's it's
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
an objectively you know objective
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
metrics to try
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
and get at that question about block
 
01:04:11.839 --> 01:04:13.990 align:start position:0%
and get at that question about block
voting

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions from members of
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
the committee for mr feign
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative porter has her hand up
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative porter is recognized
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you mr fang
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to get my head around this
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
i know that we have
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
a district in um
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
in the house that is containing two
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
towns a smaller town
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
and a larger town and there are a large
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
um representatives from that district i
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
think it's 9 or 11 or something like
 
01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
think it's 9 or 11 or something like
that

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i know that one of the town the
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
smaller town has come to us several
 
01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.470 align:start position:0%
smaller town has come to us several
times

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
to ask us to do something about that
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
because they feel they're
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
they are saying they don't feel they're
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
being represented
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
so my question is i'm thinking of this
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
especially let's just say that there are
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
two parties the banana party and the
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
apple party
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
and when they the apple party has more
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
members in this district and so when
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
the vote comes around um all 11
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
representatives are
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
elected by the apple party which has
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
55 percent of the population are apples
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
45 percent of the populations are
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
bananas and they don't get anybody
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
and what you're saying with this is the
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
bananas would have a chance
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
is that right that is exactly right and
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
if you were talking about the
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
two towns that make up hillsborough 37
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
which is 11 but you mentioned nine that
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh so right any of these larger ones or
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
any of these three
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
seat ones the idea you're absolutely
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
now they become competitive the issue in
 
01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:53.589 align:start position:0%
now they become competitive the issue in
11

01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
11
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
is whether it's going to be 7-4 or
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be 6-5
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's the competitiveness or whether a
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
flip on the 6-5
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
um absolutely you have it perfect those
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
55 45s
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
become competitive a three district a
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
three-member district
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
is almost certainly going to be two to
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
one in favor of the majority party
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
but with being heard from the minority
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
party um
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that's how it works the apples and
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
bananas and anyone else
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
in the mix um gets a fair proportional
 
01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.750 align:start position:0%
in the mix um gets a fair proportional
share

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
based on the size of the district and
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
how many seats can be allocated
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
so six five seven four in that
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
significant you know that like 56
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
percent district if you're talking about
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
the one i am with the two towns
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
um that i might be thinking you're
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
talking about um
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
if it's 56 in favor of that party
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
um 57 then the battle is on for how to
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
get the
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
five six the six five the seven four or
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
whatever and and
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
all out push for eight three if you feel
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
you have the strength you know
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
but it's the voters that will break it
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
down to exactly those numbers you
 
01:06:55.839 --> 01:06:59.349 align:start position:0%
down to exactly those numbers you
described

01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman cody and um members

i can yes all right great so um
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
i've been working on ranked choice
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
voting in maine for
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
for quite a few years and i was asked to
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
how it worked logistically in the 2018
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
elections on how difficult it was
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
for the towns to implement ranked choice
 
01:07:40.839 --> 01:07:42.069 align:start position:0%
for the towns to implement ranked choice
voting

01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
in in maine not sure about how you're
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
set up in new hampshire but in maine we
 
01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:47.829 align:start position:0%
set up in new hampshire but in maine we
have

01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
over 500 individual election
 
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.549 align:start position:0%
over 500 individual election
jurisdictions

01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
each one runs their own election each
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
one has their own town clerk and maine
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
the town clerk
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
does the job of the moderator in new
 
01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:01.670 align:start position:0%
does the job of the moderator in new
hampshire

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a widely dispersed function
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
some of the bigger towns have much more
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
professional management some of
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns have more part-time
 
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.230 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns have more part-time
management

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of diversity in the way elections
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
are conducted in maine
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
over 90 percent of our ballots are cast
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
using optical scanning equipment
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
we happen to use the esn s d s 200
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
which is not the same as dominion but is
 
01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
which is not the same as dominion but is
also

01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
rankers voting compatible our secretary
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
of state did a long-term lease
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
on standard voting equipment a few years
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
ago so all of our towns that do
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
have scanners use the same equipment um
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
about half our towns count hand count
 
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.269 align:start position:0%
about half our towns count hand count
ballots

01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not that many ballots it's you
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
know less than ten percent of the actual
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
ballots are hand counted
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
as repres as representative reed
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier you can't
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
do a statewide rank choice voting tally
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
unless you bring all of the records
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
together in a central location so
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
in maine the towns didn't actually have
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
any other work to do
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
they processed on election night just
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
like they normally would
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
if they were scanner towns they ran
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
through the scanner tallies and they
 
01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
through the scanner tallies and they
announced

01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
announced
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
that first choice the first choice votes
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
cast in the rank choice voting races if
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
they were hand countdowns
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't process all the ranked
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
choice elements they
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
tabulated only the first choice votes
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
and announced those to the press just as
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
they would on any other election night
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
the next day wednesday they packaged up
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
their election materials
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
signed off on their results did their
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
balance sheets to make sure they had
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
accounted for
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
all the ballots and then those were
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
couriered to
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
augusta where as representative reed
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
described we had
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
leased a high speed scanner and the
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
ballots that had been hand counted were
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
all sped through that
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
scanner so that we could produce an
 
01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.189 align:start position:0%
scanner so that we could produce an
electronic

01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
cast vote record which is basically a
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
record of
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
the voter preferences on every single
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
ballot and every single race
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
once you've got that the tabulation of
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
the rank choice outcome
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
takes only a matter of minutes um 20
 
01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:19.430 align:start position:0%
takes only a matter of minutes um 20
minutes

01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
or or less actually so it was not really
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
much work for the te
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
m much more work for the towns at all
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
the state did deploy a team of you know
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
12 or 15 people
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
that worked on the central tabulation
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
and there were some expenses to the
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
state as representative reed
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
pointed out it was nowhere near as
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
expensive as we
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
feared or thought but there were those
 
01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.030 align:start position:0%
feared or thought but there were those
expensive

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
expenses and there was some planning at
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
the state level but for the towns
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
it was no more work my town clerk in
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
ellsworth here
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know she just said it was no
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
different than running a normal election
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
the town clerks did get questions about
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
how rank choice
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
voting worked and the secretary of state
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
did a big public relations
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
push to make sure that voters were well
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
informed and that clerks had the tools
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
they need to explain to voters
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
how to cast a rank choice ballot
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
one clerk that i know of had a looping
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
video of the secretary of state giving
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
his rank choice voting speech that ran
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
all day on election day so that people
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
who wanted to be better informed could
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
watch that video and hear from the
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
secretary of state how it worked
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
but our surveys show that exit survey
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
showed that almost everybody understood
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
what they were supposed to do
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
and people didn't really have a problem
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
or were not
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
that confused about casting a ranked
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
choice ballot but anyway the
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think i was asked here four and a
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
half minutes
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think i was asked here to talk about
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
that that it wasn't really much
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
different for the towns than
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
conducting a straight vote for one
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
election and um
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
i think i've made that point so if you
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
have any questions i'm happy to answer
 
01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.550 align:start position:0%
have any questions i'm happy to answer
them

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from ms luther
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
i hear none pam do you see any
 
01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.630 align:start position:0%
i hear none pam do you see any
indications

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
indications
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
no all right thank you very much is
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%

01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
i see no humans all right in that case
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
no hands have been raised going once
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%

i've got questions i can't really speak
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe there'll be somebody available
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
to answer them or maybe they won't be
 
01:13:14.239 --> 01:13:14.709 align:start position:0%
to answer them or maybe they won't be
but

01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
i can't do anything about it um
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you let's see uh so there's no
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
indication of anyone wishing to speak on
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
houseboat 1390 correct
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay in that event um
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative pruden o'brien did you
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
want to take an opportunity
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
to speak to uh house bill 1457
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
well um yeah i mean i would say the same
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
thing that i said before
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
bless you okay so there we go i just
 
01:13:45.679 --> 01:13:46.149 align:start position:0%
bless you okay so there we go i just
said

01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
we all know what i said before i don't
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
want to belabor it
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh so all of that stands the only thing
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
i have to add
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
this should be made um a recommendation
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's too difficult for many
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
um clerks
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
in the larger towns and supervisors of
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
the checklist to manage
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
at this point so if it's a
 
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.630 align:start position:0%
at this point so if it's a
recommendation

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
you can continue to think about how to
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
implement that
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
in the future um i still believe it's
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
and something to continue to work
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
towards but
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the larger cities it's it was shouted
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
you would you would concede that there
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
are significant difficulties with the
 
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:50.630 align:start position:0%
are significant difficulties with the
current

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
form of the bill under under present
 
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.310 align:start position:0%
form of the bill under under present
circumstances

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
that that a fair statement that's what
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
we were told and i don't want to
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to coerce um people to
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
into doing things that are very
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to do i know the town
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
clerks already have a lot of work
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
and supervisors of the checklist
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
so i would like to just continue to look
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
for ways to make it more manageable for
 
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
for ways to make it more manageable for
them

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
well i was going to suggest you you you
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
are aware of course representative that
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're at liberty to refile some form of
 
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.630 align:start position:0%
you're at liberty to refile some form of
this

01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill in the future yes so that's
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
so that is what i would like to do all
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
and given that is there anyone else who
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
wishes to
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
i would assume not no hands are up
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
all right we will move to house bill
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
1668 and i will ask the same question is
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay in that case we will commence with
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
the previously scheduled executive
 
01:16:01.679 --> 01:16:02.630 align:start position:0%
the previously scheduled executive
session

01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
it is not the uh
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
chair's wish of his heart that we do it
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
this way as you know ordinarily we do
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
not we have a
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
process whereby a subcommittee is
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
appointed and
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
that whole process takes place but as
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
you all know we haven't been able to
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
do that in the normal fashion and so
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman just so you know
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative porter has her hand up
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
i can wait till you finish mr chair and
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
then i can i think i was
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
but go ahead i just wanted to remind
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
people and i'm sure most of us know this
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
anyway but
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
if the committee recommends future
 
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.270 align:start position:0%
if the committee recommends future
legislation

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
or the committee does not recommend
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
the bill can still be filed in either
 
01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.390 align:start position:0%
the bill can still be filed in either
case

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't prevent us saying we don't
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation doesn't
 
01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.470 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation doesn't
mean

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
that the bill can't come back in a
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
different form
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
or the same form next term is that right
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
that is correct in fact uh nothing this
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
committee will do today will impact any
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
members ability to file any bill they
 
01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:22.950 align:start position:0%
members ability to file any bill they
may

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
choose to file in the future

representative
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak to your
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
motion thank you mr chairman
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
um i have a number of concerns with the
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
legislation but but
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
the major one really is that this bill
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
would take effect
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
when uh the states that represent a
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
majority of electoral votes
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
have enacted this agreement um in a
 
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.350 align:start position:0%
have enacted this agreement um in a
research

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
office memo done on this bill back in
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
january of
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
2019 it was pointed out there were four
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
538 electors and a majority would be
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh 270 and we're only at 172
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
um electors now falling
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
under this national popular vote compact
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
but even if we hit the 270 number
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
that still leaves a big hole of 268
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
electors who won't be following
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
the national popular vote so i have a
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
little concern with the threshold itself
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
personally if it was a little higher
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
i could probably support the bill but
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
simply being a majority vote
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
i don't and one of the arguments for
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is that currently the the
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
presidential campaigns are
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
are being conducted geographically so
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
candidates can target uh you know swing
 
01:19:26.719 --> 01:19:27.350 align:start position:0%
candidates can target uh you know swing
states

01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's really going to
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
change under a national popular vote
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
um they're then going to be simply
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
targeting the high population centers
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
and that's going to shift a lot of the
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
attention towards small states like new
 
01:19:39.199 --> 01:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
attention towards small states like new
hampshire

01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh towards some of the largest cities
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
like like new york and pennsylvania and
 
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.630 align:start position:0%
like like new york and pennsylvania and
california

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
california
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
so that they can get a better uh total
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
in their
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
national popular vote numbers so as the
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill is currently written i can't
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
support it
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
i recognize that this is the fifth time
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
the bill's been introduced in
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
in recent years and it'll be probably a
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
sixth time in the next session but uh
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
as it is presently written i can't i
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
can't support house bill 541 and
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
so that's the purpose of my motion so
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to be recognized
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
to speak on
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
represent pearson you are recognized
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you pam thank you mr uh chair
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
um as a co-sponsor of this bill i think
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's no mystery that
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
that i'd i'll be voting against this
 
01:20:29.679 --> 01:20:30.390 align:start position:0%
that i'd i'll be voting against this
motion

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh but i just wanted to quickly address
 
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
uh but i just wanted to quickly address
uh

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons why and i mean this
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
is a big
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh discussion 270 electors
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
it seems like we could get in the weeds
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
about it but sometimes i think it's
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
easier to distill it
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
just to the core principles and you know
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
when when this country was founded
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
the big hedge against uh the big hedge
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
against population was the senate
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's the institutional body that was
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
formed uh to hedge against uh you know
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
the metropolitan um cities on the coast
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the presidential electors and
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think that the use of them
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
as this hedge is is is kind of
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
antithetical to what this government was
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
founded on
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
um i also think that while those other
 
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.950 align:start position:0%
um i also think that while those other
electors

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
electors
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh the the the 270 that haven't or the
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
the group that
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
didn't follow the 270 to do this popular
 
01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
didn't follow the 270 to do this popular
vote

01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
um initiative they'd still be included
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
in and who selects the president by
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
virtue of those states population being
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
factored into the national popular vote
 
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:35.750 align:start position:0%
factored into the national popular vote
um

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
count so with those reasons i'll vote
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
against this motion
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
and um i recognize that it takes a lot
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
to get bills passed in new hampshire
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
state house and i hope that
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
um we see this again thanks
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%

01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
on the motion of not recommended for
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%

because what it caused to come to my
 
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.790 align:start position:0%
because what it caused to come to my
mind

01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that i think one could argue
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
that if congress and the senate which
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
are the bodies constitutionally
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
who are supposed to be the ones um
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
doing things on a federal level were
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
doing what they were supposed to be
 
01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.350 align:start position:0%
doing what they were supposed to be
doing

01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
and not basically abdicating a lot of
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the white house
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
for many many many terms maybe the press
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
for national popular vote wouldn't be
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
so persistent thank you thank you
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%

the principal authority of the president

about how the people in their 20s today

have had two presidential elections
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
where the

01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
the bill that that group of young people
 
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:46.790 align:start position:0%
the bill that that group of young people
heard

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%

concept

01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
of getting rid of the
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
electoral college as we know it because
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
they felt that their voices
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%

01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
technically
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
but in case i do
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
and star six is mute unmute if you want
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
to use that
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
do you know about any music capability
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
we might utilize for times like this pam
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
i don't you don't want to hear me sing
 
01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:33.110 align:start position:0%
i don't you don't want to hear me sing
either

01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
i can sing though if you would you could
 
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.950 align:start position:0%
i can sing though if you would you could
yeah

01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
at least we know when this happens the
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
i don't have any ideas about deal with
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
it other than wait
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
yep that's all you can do right i just
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
keep seeing that you know that it's
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
trying to connect to the audio
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
know

01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
actually she seconded the motion
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm not making assumptions no we're
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
not we're not going down that road
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
no smart move david
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
it was a good one i got something
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the supreme court case about
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
yep i bet she's very frustrated
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is going to take from us i bet
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
i would bet should we tell her to hang
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
up and
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
join us again well i think we already
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
did if she can hear us
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
right and i'm sure brad would suggest
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
that as you know that's that's often the
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
solution to to many connection problems
 
01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:58.629 align:start position:0%
solution to to many connection problems
but

01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh i haven't heard back from him he said
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
he'd call
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know a few minutes ago and i'm sure
 
01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:05.830 align:start position:0%
you know a few minutes ago and i'm sure
they're

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
on the phone together i imagine they're
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
i won't have to well no that's true
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and we are not happy about
 
01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.470 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and we are not happy about
that

01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%

and he said that they're
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
she that representative gay could hear
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
but could not be heard
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
and he sent her the public link and i
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
suggested maybe
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
phoning in instead but um they're
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
they're working on it there's
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
great all right clerk
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
yes we have just taken the vote on hb
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
541 and you are the only person who has
 
01:35:54.719 --> 01:35:55.109 align:start position:0%
541 and you are the only person who has
not

01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
voted and the vote is to not
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation how do
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
you vote
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
therefore uh mr chair that the
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
um gays were 11 votes and the nays are
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
five so the motion carries
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam clerk uh i would say not
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
only to represent bergeron but all
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
subsequent people
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
charged with having to present a
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
statement to me regarding the
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
committee's action that i will accept
 
01:36:37.679 --> 01:36:38.149 align:start position:0%
committee's action that i will accept
them

01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
and if that is that a sufficient amount
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
i assume that will be a sufficient
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
amount of time for everybody
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
sure and uh
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 554 and i will recognize
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i'm going to move
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
that we recommend against uh future
 
01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.709 align:start position:0%
that we recommend against uh future
registration

01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
do you want me to speak further or just
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
lay there i i will
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
first let's let's let's let's recognize
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
the motion and get a second
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
is there a second to the motion i did i
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
understand correctly
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
promotions not to recommend for future
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
legislation is that right
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh seconded by
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative hozel
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative lane you're recognized to
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:51.510 align:start position:0%
okay i will essentially be plagiarizing
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:52.870 align:start position:0%
okay i will essentially be plagiarizing
[Music]

01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative moynihan's report earlier
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the year
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
while the verification of the machines
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
of the accurate
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
machines that count the votes is
 
01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.109 align:start position:0%
machines that count the votes is
important

01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
we found that the terms of the bill did
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
not resolve
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
the conflicting principles that it
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
sought to correct we found a lot of
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
issues with them and i feel also that
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
they may be resolved in other ways
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i'm moving against
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%

yes thank you mr chairman i i would also
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
like to point out that uh
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 283 became law uh and you
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
may remember that that was senator
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
gray's bill it
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
contained a number of provisions but one
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
dealt with a post-election audit of
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting devices
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
one of the provisions is that the

01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
study by november 1st

uh having that report due
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%

01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
waiting for that report and so i will
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%

we recommend for
[Music]

01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative porter has moved
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation on
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 728
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
can i speak to my motion mr chair yes i
 
01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
was about to recognize you to do just
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
that representative and you are hereby
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mr chair um
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
rank choice voting is getting more and
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
more popular with the population as
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
at large i think it's worth looking
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
into i would highly recommend that the
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
file this bill again next term
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
do increase the amount of education
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
that they do to help people understand
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
because to be honest with me with you
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
what i read to prepare for this
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
meeting today did not make it as clear
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
to me as it should have
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
um i think they also need to make some
 
01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.270 align:start position:0%
um i think they also need to make some
provision

01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
to help the local
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
election officials understand the
 
01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:33.750 align:start position:0%
election officials understand the
process

01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
and allay their fears but i think it's
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
worth looking into
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
i think it might take a while but i
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
think we should be pursuing this idea
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter is there
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
on house bill 728 the motion is to
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
we've got hands from representatives
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
pearson bergeron and pruden o'brien uh
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
represent pearson you're recognized
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just wanted to be
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
specific about
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to signify with this
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
vote i
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'm taking this vote because i think the
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
state house should take on for
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
further or future legislation around
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
this issue of ranked choice voting
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know right actually i do know i
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
don't think the bill that we see before
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
us today
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
is that legislation was that hb 728
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
i think there are significant questions
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
about um the plurality issue
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to new hampshire's
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
constitution and even if you said we
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
could do it on a presidential level
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and ignore state races i really don't
 
01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:39.669 align:start position:0%
um and ignore state races i really don't
think

01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
our our poll workers are going to be
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
running two different kinds of elections
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
on any given year
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's right to ask for
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
them and that's a nice segue into part
 
01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:47.910 align:start position:0%
them and that's a nice segue into part
two

01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
my comments about this is an idea which
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
we need to get local officials behind it
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
by this vote you're getting a green
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
light from at least some members on the
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
house election law
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
committee that this is a good idea to go
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
um but i want to be specific that the
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill we see today
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't include that language um and
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we're doing this vote in the
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
first place otherwise
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
we we would be going forward with policy
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
as a policy initiative so i think
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work to be done with
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
local officials too
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
how are we going to be doing recounts is
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
this easily done
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
i mean the ballot machines we have right
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
now don't work with it so we need to be
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
sure that the ballot machines we buy do
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
if that's where we're going to go if
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's the direction we decide to go
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to be clear about what
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
this vote signifies and um
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
again i do look forward to seeing what
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to become
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh next term and and maybe the term
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
after we'll see how it goes
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you represent pearson
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh let me see represent bergeron you're
 
01:44:50.719 --> 01:44:51.830 align:start position:0%
uh let me see represent bergeron you're
recognized

01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%

01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll be voting
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
against the motion
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh for several reasons first of all
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
note on the legislation although
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
maine's experience can probably give us
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
a good idea what that cost will be
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
prior to the first use of rank choice
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
voting a memo issued by the
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
maine secretary of state projected a
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
cost of eighty thousand dollars per
 
01:45:15.679 --> 01:45:16.790 align:start position:0%
cost of eighty thousand dollars per
election

01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
um following that election indicated
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
that the actual cost was
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
102 653
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
so if we're looking at two or three
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
elections a year
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
um then certainly you know just multiply
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
that number by that
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
number of elections the second thing is
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
i want to address the issue of machines
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
um it is true the secretary of state is
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
exploring the certification
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
of new voting machines that
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
certification will have to be done by
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
however the state does not pay for these
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
machines it's the local cities and towns
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
that have to pay for them
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
and so i would assume that once these
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
machines new machines are certified
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
the state will allow the ones that are
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
in current use to continue being used
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
until such time as the towns and cities
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
find the money to buy new machines
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
so there is a cost here that's unlike
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
the experience in maine
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
where it's my understanding that the
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
paid for the machines so that's a
 
01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:14.550 align:start position:0%
paid for the machines so that's a
concern

01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
i also would like to echo representative
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
pearson's comments
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
that i have concerns about the
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
consistency that
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
applicated the consistent application of
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
rank choice voting
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
it will be used for some races perhaps
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
in state and federal elections but not
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
in local elections
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be a constant
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
re-education of voters going
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
on by our city and town officials trying
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
to get them to understand
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
which type of accounting is going to be
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
used at the polling places
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's also the question of the
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
definition of plurality
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
our state constitution requires that
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
among others the
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
governor the executive council the
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
senators be elected by a plurality of
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
and this the the term plurality is not a
 
01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:01.109 align:start position:0%
and this the the term plurality is not a
policeman's

01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
policeman's
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
word by that i mean it doesn't have
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
multiple meanings uh
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
the meaning of the word goes back to the
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
13th or 14th century and it simply means
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
a plurality occurs when the votes
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
received by a candidate are greater than
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
those received
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
by any opponent but can be less than the
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
majority of the total vote and that
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
the texas secretary of state's glossary
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
of terms
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i have concerns about the
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional applications of some
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
provisions of this law
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
the bill redefines plurality by saying
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
a certain minimum percentage of votes is
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
needed to achieve a plurality
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
um well you know you could say that a
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
duck is a
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
a mammal with long legs and big lip
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
smout and a humpback and lives in the
 
01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.750 align:start position:0%
smout and a humpback and lives in the
desert

01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
desert
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that a camel is a
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
duck so it's
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
getting a little off track there but
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
just applying a new definition to a term
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
that has had the same meaning for
 
01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.669 align:start position:0%
that has had the same meaning for
centuries

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
centuries
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think would pass legal muster so
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
those are some of the reasons i'll be
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
voting against this bill
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:48:05.199 --> 01:48:07.030 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
o'brien

01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
o'brien
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh i'm voting against this as well i the
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
complexity of it
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh is a as a large reason i
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to attend a large
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
gathering in maine
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
i brought this issue up no one in the
 
01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:23.510 align:start position:0%
i brought this issue up no one in the
room

01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
was happy with ranked choice voting and
 
01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.030 align:start position:0%
was happy with ranked choice voting and
it

01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
started it seemed to start quite an
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
argument but
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
not really because everyone was in
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
agreement that it was too complex and
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't like it
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't like the courier idea we
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
have to get our
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
elections done on the same day in new
 
01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:43.990 align:start position:0%
elections done on the same day in new
hampshire

01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
and having couriers taking
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
part things uh around the state
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
to then be uh processed elsewhere
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
that that's scary to me when everything
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
that every other state election law that
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
it focuses on transparency and
 
01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.270 align:start position:0%
it focuses on transparency and
understandability

01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
understandability
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
of the people that are there at the
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
polling place to observe
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
everything going on so i will be voting
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know on this one thank you
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
so anyone else who wishes to speak to
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
the motion which is that
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
the bill be approved for future
 
01:49:27.679 --> 01:49:30.310 align:start position:0%
the bill be approved for future
legislation

01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
if not um i have something to say i will
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
be voting
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
against the motion but i will be doing
 
01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.430 align:start position:0%
against the motion but i will be doing
so

01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
as previous speakers have said because i
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
do not think that the bill
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
has written and before us is ready for
 
01:49:45.199 --> 01:49:45.589 align:start position:0%
has written and before us is ready for
prime

01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
prime
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
time for constitutional and other
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
reasons that does not mean that i'm
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
taking a position
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
that any and all future versions of
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
and suggestions about ranked choice
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
voting will necessarily
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
meet with my disapproval i i just feel
 
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:02.629 align:start position:0%
meet with my disapproval i i just feel
constrained

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
constrained
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
that we are we don't have the
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility we might
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise have to amend and i
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
think um therefore if i were going to
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
vote on it
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
as it's before me i think i have to vote
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
no it
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
it no sense is a is a
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
discouragement to the sponsor or anyone
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
else who wants to explore
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
other avenues
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you that being the case
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
madam clerk you may call the role the
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
motion is approved for further
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
future legislation okay
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative moynihan i vote yes

01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation is
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
i'll second that second
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
pearson you're recognized to speak to
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair right because i'm
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
still unmuted um
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
no so this is uh this bill uh it
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
goes on to specify what specific things
 
01:57:19.679 --> 01:57:20.950 align:start position:0%
goes on to specify what specific things
um

01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't be allowed as campaign
 
01:57:23.679 --> 01:57:24.790 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't be allowed as campaign
expenditures

01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's not an exhaustive list but it does
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
again it has
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
it adds specificity to what you wouldn't
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
be allowed to use
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh your campaign donation um
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm moving that that this you
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
know should be uh
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
acted on with further legislation it's
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh we had testimony that indicated that
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
this was a problem for some reps eg had
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't cleared not it was enforceable
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
and that this might have helped add some
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
specificity to it to overuse that work
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
um the point is is it
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
makes our campaign laws a little bit
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
more robust and i'm in favor of that
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
i think future legislatures should take
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
that on thanks
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you is any further discussion on
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
um just like a similar bill
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier this afternoon uh
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 283
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
was uh um passed by the house and senate
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
and signed into law by the governor it
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
requires that the secretary of state
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
provide a report or a plan on how to
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
conduct uh
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
verification on our electronic voting
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
devices and i
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
believe we should wait for that and see
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
what uh the secretary of state is
 
02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
what uh the secretary of state is
proposing

02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
i also have a a real problem with the
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
concept that
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
25 voters in the district can
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
effectively slow down the vote count uh
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
on an election just by saying that we
 
02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
on an election just by saying that we
want

02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
a hand count done on one of the races um
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the night and i just can't
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
imagine what that would mean if someone
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
did that for the upcoming presidential
 
02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:23.270 align:start position:0%
did that for the upcoming presidential
election

02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
how late our poll workers would be uh at
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
the polls
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
we buy the uh electronic voting devices
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
to speed up the process
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
and this would slow it down tremendously
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
i just uh can't support
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh the concept that's being proposed by
 
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%

the the intent of this legislation is
 
02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.270 align:start position:0%
the the intent of this legislation is
good

02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
um some of the provisions make the
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
um some of the provisions make the
process

02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
of working with the nursing homes and
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
other assisted
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
living facilities somewhat onerous among
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
them for example
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
is the requirement that a public notice
 
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
be provided 30 days prior to the date of
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
any visit
 
02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
i know from from my own experience that
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's not unusual
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
for new residents in a nursing home to
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
ask maybe
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
days or or a week before an election if
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
someone might come out to get them
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
registered to vote
 
02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
at their new residence there's also the
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
the dynamics of trying to get
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklists and town
 
02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:21.669 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklists and town
clerks

02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh being able to meet at the same time
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then finally the definition of how
 
02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:28.149 align:start position:0%
and then finally the definition of how
many

02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
types of facilities this affects is
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
pretty broad
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
um nashua has about seven nursing homes
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
in its and assisted living facilities uh
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
in its boundaries
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
but there are about 30 homes that would
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
fall within the
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
the definitions provided by this
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
um well i think it would be a great idea
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
to develop some kind of best practices
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
or standards
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
ask the secretary of state to to share
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
that with the city and town clerks
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
i i just don't think it's appropriate to
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into our statutes
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
as as written in this legislation at
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
this time
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%

02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative award is recognized
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to agree with what the
 
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
previous comments
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
were and to say that it's obviously a
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
very well-intentioned bill
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
that seems impractical in its current
 
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
that seems impractical in its current
form

02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative ward
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
i still think it's a valid bill uh
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the idea is good 23 states
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
require this sort of thing if the
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
hang up is about definitions of kind of
 
02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:52.709 align:start position:0%
hang up is about definitions of kind of
homes

02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
and that is something that can be worked
 
02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:56.069 align:start position:0%
and that is something that can be worked
on

02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
and i know that administrators of
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
did tell me that they would be pleased
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
this sort of situation because then they
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
would be certain that they were in
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
they were acting in accordance to all
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
state laws
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
and it would make them more comfortable
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
so not only them
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
but that residents would be more
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
comfortable knowing that everything was
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
done correctly
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
we do pay our clerks and uh supervisors
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the checklist
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
so i i feel like if this is a job that
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
people are being paid to do
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
then uh this could fall under it so i do
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
strongly believe that uh visiting
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
homes of disabled adults is still a very
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
valid thing
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
access that process thank you thank you
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
and that are two more hands up mr
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
chairman representatives holzel
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
and gay representative hosel you are
 
02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:58.870 align:start position:0%
and gay representative hosel you are
recognized

02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman although i'm a
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill i do think it
 
02:09:04.079 --> 02:09:05.350 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill i do think it
has

02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
many many things in it that concern
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
me i know that most town clerks
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
if they were asked to go to a nursing
 
02:09:15.199 --> 02:09:16.229 align:start position:0%
if they were asked to go to a nursing
home

02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
or one of these facilities
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
they would show um i think this
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
would be too restrictive
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
and and it will cost money
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
so i i'm going to go with not
 
02:09:33.599 --> 02:09:34.629 align:start position:0%
so i i'm going to go with not
recommended

02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
i think that if anyone wishes to put
 
02:09:37.679 --> 02:09:38.709 align:start position:0%
i think that if anyone wishes to put
another

02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh bill in they're welcome to do that
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
pam i forgot who the other hand up was
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative gay how could i forget
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
you you're recognized
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and maybe maybe that
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
was a freudian
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
slip i doubt it i
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
i um i uh support
 
02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
what a representative holtzel just said
 
02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's uh got a good intent
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think it can be worked out so that
 
02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:14.229 align:start position:0%
i think it can be worked out so that
it's

02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
offers a supportive service to
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
these many kinds of homes
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
but it needs to be a new bill needs to
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
be written
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
so i will say that i support the current
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
the current uh motion but i'm hoping
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
that in the future
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
we can do a new bill and make it so that
 
02:10:35.679 --> 02:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
we can do a new bill and make it so that
it's

02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
advisory and offers help upon request
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
but not obligatory
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative gay i see no
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
other hands and
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say just briefly i agree
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
with the comments of
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
all the people who spoke affirmatively
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
suggest that the sponsor
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
persevere because this is not this is
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
again you're caught between the issue of
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
how the bill is written versus the
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
concept and
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
i think everyone is in favor of the
 
02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
concept but
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
a little leery of the situation and in
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
addition i'm not sure how
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
enactment of this bill as it currently
 
02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
enactment of this bill as it currently
is

02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
would work in our current nursing home
 
02:11:21.199 --> 02:11:22.390 align:start position:0%
would work in our current nursing home
situation

02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
since we seem to have some significant
 
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:25.910 align:start position:0%
since we seem to have some significant
covert

02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
covert
 
02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
issues with with nursing homes that were
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
obviously not
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
to anyone much less the sponsor at the
 
02:11:32.239 --> 02:11:32.950 align:start position:0%
to anyone much less the sponsor at the
time

02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
um this particular version was filed so
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
so yes i will i'll reluctantly
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
vote for this motion but i would urge
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
the sponsor to persevere
 
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
any further discussion the motion is not
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
to recommend
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
hearing the clerk we'll call the roll
 
02:11:58.719 --> 02:11:59.510 align:start position:0%

the other ones i think we may have heard
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
someone speaking to someone else
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we just heard somebody make
 
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
a noise and i that's why i
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
thought i thought maybe i was missing
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
someone but we have 16 votes
 
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that being the case um
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
we will move forward to house bill 1668
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
which for the information of those of
 
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:19.430 align:start position:0%
which for the information of those of
you

02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
who may not be following along is the
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
last bill which i
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
suspect some of our attendees are
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
looking at with great relief
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
i would recognize representative pearson
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
who i believe has a motion
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
as correct i'm going to recommend this
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
inexpedient for
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
future legislation representative
 
02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:41.270 align:start position:0%
future legislation representative
pearson

02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
pearson
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
has moved not recommended for future
 
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
legislation is there a
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
second target seconded by representative
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
ward i believe
 
02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative pearson you are
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to your motion
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'll be real quick i
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know i think that
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
especially right now with the kobit 19
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
situation early voting is something that
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
the committee should be looking at it's
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh this was
 
02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
gonna pertain to early voting only as it
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
regards to uh
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
disabled persons we saw some significant
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
hurdles with how this would work and
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
we're not sure that the pilot program
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
with disabled people is the
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
right way to go but um but yeah
 
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
i still stand by the motion that it's uh
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
not expedient for future legislation
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson to say
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
for the discussion on the motion
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
not to recommend for future legislation
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1668
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
to chairman yes representative bergeron
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh if i may i have just a very brief
 
02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
uh if i may i have just a very brief
comment

02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
sure uh i supported this going to
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
interim study for
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
one reason only
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
one of the speakers who presented on
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
behalf of the granite state independent
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
living foundation
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned an interest in trying to have
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
the accessible
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
voting tablets available at the city or
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
town clerk's office
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
prior to an election so they could use
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
the same device
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
in town hall if they weren't going to
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
the polls as they would if they did go
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the polls
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
i think that's something that can be
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
pursued outside of legislation
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i just wanted the committee
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
members to know that i'll have a
 
02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
discussion with the secretary of state's
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
office to see how practical it would be
 
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
um logistically to try and
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
address that uh interest among the
 
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
disabled community uh but other than
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
that i agree with
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's comments and
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
that will support the motion
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bergeron um i
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
would suggest that maybe
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
you might get together with
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative pearson when he writes a
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
statement then see if some
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh positive nod might be made in that
 
02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:51.270 align:start position:0%
uh positive nod might be made in that
direction

02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
in the actual statement itself thank you
 
02:16:57.669 --> 02:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
um that being the case is there any
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
