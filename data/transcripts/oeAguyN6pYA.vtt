00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna get started welcome to
 
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee subcommittee on
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
HB 283 relative to
 
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.729 align:start position:0%
HB 283 relative to
um

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 align:start position:0%
rental application fees charged
 
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
prospective tenants
 
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
um so we are going to get started with
 
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
allegiance to the flag of the United
 
00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
States of America and to the Republic
 
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 align:start position:0%
which it stands one nation under God
 
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
indivisible with liberty and justice for
 
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.490 align:start position:0%
indivisible with liberty and justice for
all

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay so we have five members of the
 
00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and if there's anybody from
 
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that would also like to um
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
uh join with us that'd be great I'm
 
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to uh representative
 
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
De Lorenzo representative Horrigan
 
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny and then
 
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp who is absent right
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
now so
 
00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
um we are going to get started so I
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
first want to
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
call on the
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor to lay out
 
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
the path that this bill has taken and
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
set the stage
 
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
is that a breed thank you Mr chair happy
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
to set the stage so HB 283 the original
 
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
Bill uh sought to put a cap on uh
 
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
application fees for rental units of 35
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
or the cost of doing a background and
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
credit check whichever was less this is
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
in keeping with a lot of similar laws on
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
the books in over a dozen other states
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
some states have outlawed application
 
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
fees outright the landlords in those
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
states have not gone out of the
 
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 align:start position:0%
landlording business
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
many states have capped it 25 35 55 in
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
that in that kind of range so
 
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
our housing situation the reason the
 
00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
impetus of putting this in is our
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
housing situation has been so severe in
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
this state that our vacancy rate has
 
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
been near 0.6 percent is the last number
 
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
that I've heard and this has created a
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
situation that
 
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
unduly favors landlords so that they've
 
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
managed to make application fees
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
themselves a revenue stream all on its
 
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.390 align:start position:0%
themselves a revenue stream all on its
own

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
um this is unlike any other industry
 
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
because in every other industry when
 
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get customers in you
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
incorporate those costs costs of
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
business that's free market
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
um and then you make up those costs
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
through your normal profits but uh in
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
our situation landlords didn't just stop
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
at having application fees in many
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
situations they would have empty units
 
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 align:start position:0%
or sometimes no units available
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
advertised and just bring in application
 
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
fees and with people being so desperate
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
they were able to not only increase
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
those application fees but rake in
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
dozens of application fees in a month
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
that would actually exceed the cost of
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
even what what they would have gotten
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
from a tenant renting a unit so not just
 
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
that but they've started recently doing
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
things like holding fees which are in
 
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of dollars
 
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
renewal fees which really didn't exist
 
00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259 align:start position:0%
before so much it's just been all all
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
over the place kind of predatory towards
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
tenants who are in a desperate situation
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
which I don't think is how
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
um our free market is supposed to work
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
and not unduly favoring one side of that
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
two-side equation it's kind of similar
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
to selling life rings to a to a boat of
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
sinking people right so anyway
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so the bill was in there was much
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
discussion we had multiple amendments uh
 
00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:49.139 align:start position:0%
and eventually it was retained I have
 
00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
worked very with the very gracious uh
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
chair of this subcommittee to come up
 
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
with one Amendment
 
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
um the people who have been advocating
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
um didn't feel like that was necessarily
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
sufficient to address the entire problem
 
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
so we have another amendment and it is
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
up to you all to decide what the best
 
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
path forward is between those two
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
amendments or some new creative thing to
 
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
explain those amendments the amendment
 
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I am on both the amendment that
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
chair Alexander and I are on states that
 
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
first of all a landlord will disclose in
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
writing to a prospective tenant but for
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
accepting the application fee what the
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
criteria was successful background and
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
credit check would be so that tenants
 
00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
are not just throwing their money on
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
something where they have zero chance of
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
being accepted the second thing is that
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
a landlord if they do not rent to a
 
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
prospective tenant has to return
 
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
anything beyond the actual cost so
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's an actual background check credit
 
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:51.860 align:start position:0%
check and documented administrative fees
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the nebulous part that
 
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of people took objection to
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
because what is to prevent a landlord
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
from saying that it took 10 hours at
 
00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:02.459 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars an hour to process an
 
00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.430 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars an hour to process an
application

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
um and then finally uh it does
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
say that nothing in this paragraph shall
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
require the landlord to conduct one of
 
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
those checks or prohibit them from
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
accepting someone who doesn't pass those
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
checks and that's kind of important
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
because even if you put forward a
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
disclosure saying well this is my
 
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
minimum criteria you can still cite this
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
RSA saying I can still accept you even
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
if you don't pass this criteria but I'm
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
letting you know what I considered to be
 
00:09:30.959 --> 00:09:32.389 align:start position:0%
letting you know what I considered to be
acceptable

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that is for to kind of cover the
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
landlord but also to let tenants make
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
that informed decision of whether or not
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
to proceed forward with paying an
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
application fee so I think that the
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
Alexander Amendment the Reed Alexander
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
Amendment does improve our current
 
00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:49.370 align:start position:0%
Amendment does improve our current
situation

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
um the Reed kutab amendment is identical
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
to the Reed Alexander Amendment with one
 
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:56.420 align:start position:0%
addition and that is a cap
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
knowing that especially the some of the
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate who would hear
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
this were objecting to the idea of
 
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
capping at a specific dollar amount
 
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:10.820 align:start position:0%
because that wouldn't be growth proof
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
we changed it to a percentage of the
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
monthly rental amount and after much
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
discussion with interested parties we
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
settled on seven percent so yes the
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
landlord has to return anything above
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
and beyond their costs but they can't
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
take in more than seven percent of the
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
monthly rental amount just so you can
 
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
wrap your head around that number if
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
it's a thousand dollar our unit it would
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
be seventy dollars for the um for the
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
check which I think the going rate right
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
now is 65 anyway if it's a two thousand
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
dollar unit the cap would be 140 at that
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
level and uh
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
there was one other piece that is
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
escaping me but that is so that is the
 
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
functional difference between the two
 
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.110 align:start position:0%
functional difference between the two
amendments

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Reed let me
 
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.130 align:start position:0%
ask you
um

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment 2288 the one I'm not on
 
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
yes if the rent is seven hundred dollars
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
and it can exceed seven percent would
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
that even cover the cost of a background
 
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.590 align:start position:0%
that even cover the cost of a background
check

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
I mean yes because a lot of places so
 
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
for for the most part background checks
 
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
are like 10 or 15 dollars and like I
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
said there's states that have outlawed
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
them completely because it's such a
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
small amount that we're quibbling over
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
compared to the amounts of of rent that
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
landlords get so yes but I would
 
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
challenge the chair to find me a 700
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
unit we're working on it but I I worry
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
that when you put something in law like
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
this and then the prices of everything
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
goes down oh my gosh please if if if the
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
housing market were to crash like that
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
then I would gladly like put in bills to
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
strike everything
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
units that are going for that all right
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
um any other questions representative
 
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
um any other questions representative
Reed

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
Reed
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
okay so now I'd like to call on any
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
other interested parties before we start
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
discussing this so I know Nick Norman
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
said he was interested in speaking
 
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more happening on this
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
than I was aware a few days ago
 
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.730 align:start position:0%
than I was aware a few days ago
so

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
it's a little confusing is to talk about
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
which amendment because there's three
 
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that was
 
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
um representative Alexander and
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
representative Ellen Reed that was
 
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
putting that together so that's what I
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
prepared my testimony on
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
I also see
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.810 align:start position:0%
 
2286

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:10.820 align:start position:0%
2286
 
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
2286 is the one that I'm on and then two
 
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:16.139 align:start position:0%
two eight eight I see that
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
this 2286 has addressed a lot of our
 
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.009 align:start position:0%
this 2286 has addressed a lot of our
concerns

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
so depending on what you're working with
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
where primarily this subcommittee is
 
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Reed do you have another
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
copy of that Amendment
 
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.970 align:start position:0%
copy of that Amendment
I

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
the older version that has
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gleason on it 422 is
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
another one I have but we're not looking
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.009 align:start position:0%
 
Supernatural

00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
Supernatural
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so I think those are minor
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
grammatical changes two two eight six is
 
00:13:59.290 --> 00:13:59.300 align:start position:0%
the one that I'm looking at okay
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of the idea of putting
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
something in to the RSA
 
00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:18.050 align:start position:0%
something in to the RSA
that

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
housing providers could not make
 
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
application fees a profit Center
 
00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:29.899 align:start position:0%
we're okay with that that concept
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
there's a few things in that amendment
 
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
that I looked at that would be really
 
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.470 align:start position:0%
that I looked at that would be really
troublesome

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
troublesome
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
one that's still in this 2286 is
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
line End of Line 10 through 11. and the
 
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
criteria for a satisfactory criminal
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's very hard if not impossible to
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
nail down in any kind of brevity or
 
00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.650 align:start position:0%
nail down in any kind of brevity or
specificity

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
I think what did I I'm sorry I should
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
I did a quick search on the internet
 
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.250 align:start position:0%
I did a quick search on the internet
about

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
how many federal crimes there are
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:21.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's just
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
unfeasible to document with any Clarity
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
what's acceptable what's not
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
a housing provider is going to look at a
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
total picture
 
00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339 align:start position:0%
uh they're going to look at what comes
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
in for criminal
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
reports they're going to look at the
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
credit report they're going to look at
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
landlord references they're going to
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
make a judgment on the entire picture
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
they need to do that because every
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
situation is completely unique every
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
person is unique
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
if we were to have to put into some kind
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
um specific criteria what would happen
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
is the housing providers would make the
 
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.060 align:start position:0%
criteria more stringent to protect
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
themselves and to protect the residents
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
and you would in fact make it much much
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
harder for marginal applicants to get
 
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
harder for marginal applicants to get
approved

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
for instance now
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
there are some housing providers that
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
just say I will accept anyone of a
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
credit score over a certain number
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
so that's simplistic
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
and in some respects it makes their job
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
of approving application easier
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
it also typically throws out a huge
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
amount of people applying
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
in my office we don't do that and most
 
00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
landlords that I speak to don't do that
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
either because
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
when you set that credit score bar too
 
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
high you've eliminated a large amount of
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
but if we have to
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
put in specificity I can't hardly say
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
that word with criminal background
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
checks and credit reports
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
you're going to find that it's just
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
going to make it worse and worse for
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
marginal applicants so in this
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
2 2 8 6.
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
if that was stricken out
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
I think now I'd have to review it with
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
my my team but I think we can accept the
 
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.409 align:start position:0%
my my team but I think we can accept the
rest

00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
rest
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
because all of the other objectional
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
some of those other objectional pieces
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
are in this previous amendment I looked
 
00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:54.620 align:start position:0%
at it said that the
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
overage over the actual cost would have
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
to be returned to the security deposit
 
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:03.140 align:start position:0%
within 30 days
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
that would require in some cases
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
landlords to do something illegal by New
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire law a landlord cannot
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
accept more than a one-month security
 
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.390 align:start position:0%
accept more than a one-month security
deposit

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
deposit
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon that when someone
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
applies for an apartment they say here
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm very interested and I'm going to
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
give you the full security deposit when
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
I apply
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
if there's some overage and now we have
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
to return it to security that's telling
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
us we have to do something that's
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
illegal a security deposit law so if you
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
were looking at that previous Amendment
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's also I'm sorry there is one
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
other piece to this 2286 that that is
 
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.770 align:start position:0%
other piece to this 2286 that that is
problematic

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
this is amending RSA
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
540-a colon 3. that's prohibitive
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
practices and security deposits
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
the penalties
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh that go along with that are what
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
landlords often refer to as the thousand
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
don't you think that's like extreme for
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
a security deposit that or an
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
application fee that's in the range of
 
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
25 50 typically
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
some I'll be here I've heard in these
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
testimonies that housing providers are
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes charging a hundred dollar
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
application fees personally I don't know
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
any landlords that are doing that
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
but

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:41.810 align:start position:0%
but
[Music]

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
this has to be moved either to a
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
different section that doesn't impose
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
those Draconian fees or
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
or say 540-a colon four
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
does put limitations on those fees
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
so you could address that section to
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
limit the penalties out of this thousand
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
also there was in a previous version
 
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.710 align:start position:0%
also there was in a previous version
a

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
um part of it said
 
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
and also in any advertisement
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
I see that that's not included the
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
advertisement part in 2286 and that's
 
00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:35.179 align:start position:0%
good because
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
to put that huge amount of documentation
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
of trying to Define what is acceptable
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
criteria or not would swap an
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
advertisement with
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
volumes of data and imagine trying to
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
put that on a for rent sign in a window
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
I mean it's an advertisement so I'm glad
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
to see that that was taken out and I
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's the major concerns and
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
again it's a little bit
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
unclear because we've got so many
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
different versions but if you're working
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
with this 22 86 with those changes that
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
I mentioned I can run it by my team and
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Norman are there questions
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
for any questions yeah questions for Mr
 
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
for any questions yeah questions for Mr
Norman

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.049 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that would like to
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
and just introduce yourself for the
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
record yeah hello my name is Julie
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
Smiley I um gave testimony
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the original hearing for this bill
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and I am a former employee of the
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
front door agency where I served as a
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
case manager for people struggling
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
um with housing crisis and
 
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
um we also served as landlords with
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
um over 60 housing units for low-income
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
individuals and the CEO of the front
 
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
door agency Maurice wearable is here
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
today and would like to speak to the
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
from the landlord perspective
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
um so but I want to focus on the
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
perspective from a renter having worked
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
with people for almost five years who
 
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
are struggling with the housing crisis
 
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
which I think we all know is way out of
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
control in New Hampshire right now it's
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
affecting the workforce people cannot
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
find stuff because people can't find
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in the state
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
one of the huge barriers for people and
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's many barriers this is only the
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
tip of the iceberg but it's important to
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
address is a application fees people
 
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of available units
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
renters are having to apply to 20
 
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
Apartments before they are approved
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
especially people with housing vouchers
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
um and the costs are extremely
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
burdensome for people struggling on a
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
low income they don't have the excess
 
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
funds to pay for multiple application
 
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.950 align:start position:0%
funds to pay for multiple application
fees

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
um it is an absolute huge burden to
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
these families and it is also become a
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
profit Center for property managers who
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
I was reported received reports from a
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
number of them that received 50 100
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
applications for every apartment they're
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
accepting an application fee from every
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
single person that applies and ninety
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
percent of those applicants they don't
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
even run a credit check or a background
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
check on because they have so many they
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
just feasibly couldn't do it
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
um so I think that key in whichever
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment we choose to go with is
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
putting a cap on application fees and
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
ensuring that that cap is reasonable to
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
protect the renter
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
and at the same time ensure that
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
landlords at least their minimum costs
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
are met there's a cost to doing business
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
and we can't always expect in every
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
field of business that those costs are
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
always going to be met up front by the
 
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
consumer some of those costs are sort of
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
rolled in and you make your profit down
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
the road given that we have two sixty
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
thousand too few units in New Hampshire
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
for people to rent there is no end in
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
sight for the housing crisis the
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
landlord's income is protected
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
um I can't see there being an imminent
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
crash certainly not in the rental market
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how they could build 60 000
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
units that are affordable within the
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
near future in the state
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
so the other the other key point to
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
mention here is the exception to the
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um issue that was being discussed
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
previously that we are asking property
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
managers to disclose a broad
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
um the broad reasons they would be
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
looking at within a background check is
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
it a past felony conviction is it a
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
minimum credit score and clearly within
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
um the language
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
um here it states that
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
um nothing in this paragraph shall
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
require the landlord to conduct a
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
criminal background check or credit
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
check or prohibit the landlord from
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
renting to an applicant who does not
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
pass the criminal background or credit
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
check so that's it's protecting the
 
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.049 align:start position:0%
check so that's it's protecting the
landlord

00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
um that we actually thought was
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
important after receiving communication
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
from a kit Lord who sent in an email and
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
expressed concern if they prescribe a
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
criteria for background checks
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
then how could they make an exception
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
for somebody say somebody that has a
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
felony 20 years ago but has exceptional
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
credit score
 
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
um and they would be willing to sort of
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
make an exception this covers that the
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
statement in here covers that and allows
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
for that flexibility and I I am
 
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
concerned about how
 
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
keeping the cost as low as possible so
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
that only the hard costs from the
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
property manager are covered
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
um even a seven percent
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
bill is concerning to me but if people
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
are only paying one fee and everybody
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
else gets their money refunded or ends
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
up not being charged a fee that may be
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
acceptable but I still am concerned
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
about lowering the bar so increasing the
 
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
minimum amount people are going to
 
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.269 align:start position:0%
minimum amount people are going to
charge

00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
um I think those are all the points I
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
wanted to cover and I want to thank
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
everybody for their time and energies
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
especially you Joe Alexander and rep
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
read on making the efforts to address
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
this which is honestly such a huge issue
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
for people who are trying to rent
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
apartments in New Hampshire right now
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to try to answer any
 
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Smiley um are
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
I guess my uh
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
first question well my question is um
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
many of these rental housing units that
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
are available and actually some are
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
being built finally after many years of
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
no action are owned by entities which
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
are you know owned by other individuals
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
or entities who have many different uh
 
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
what multiple uh multiple uh multiple
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
different entities actually renting
 
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
apartments out so have you found that if
 
00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:07.610 align:start position:0%
apartments out so have you found that if
somebody's

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
somebody's
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
running you know trying to find an
 
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
apartment with multiple entities that
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
have interlocking ownership that the
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
owners are charging multiple application
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
fees or are they just charging them one
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to looking for
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
multiple units owned by the same same
 
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
multiple units owned by the same same
group

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
um my understanding would be you would
 
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
if it was say rare a property manager
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
that owns multiple
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
different facilities you are applying
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
for an apartment within a specific
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
facility so you your application and
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
your application fee would only apply to
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
this building over here not this
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
building over here does that was that
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's that's how I thought
 
00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
it was and okay not necessarily how I
 
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
wish it was but that's because I know
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
like in my community there's an
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
organization there's an out-of-state
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
company that bought it many properties
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
in my part of the state and they they
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
are actually a member of Nick Norman's
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
organization I think if you look at the
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
property record there's several
 
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.669 align:start position:0%
property record there's several
different

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
entities which are all owned by the same
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
company so like uh so I'm sure that's
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
the case in Nashville and everywhere
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
else too thanks
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Kenny
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
um

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
in your experience can you just tell me
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
like the range of what you've seen
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
charge for application fees currently
 
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
and maybe the average
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I have seen zero fees up to 250 fees
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
and for 250 dollars and hold fees can be
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
even more than that sometimes they're
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
asked to put a whole entire security
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
deposit amount down as
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
um a hold fee and the average cost of an
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
apartment in Nashua a two-bedroom is two
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars at this point in time
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
um did that answer your question yeah
 
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.149 align:start position:0%
um did that answer your question yeah
okay

00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
take a missed it here and thank you for
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
um Miss Smiley you mentioned
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
there was an abundance of landlords
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
collecting fees and not renting the
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
units out so the landlines are making a
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
profit do you have any background stuff
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
on that any data research or anything I
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
don't have data or research I have
 
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence from
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
um clients that would call us and tell
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
us that they had paid fees to somebody
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
and then that person just disappeared
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent anyone
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
posting an ad on Craigslist right now
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
saying I have an apartment to rent
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
getting pictures posting them up there
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
accepting application fees and
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
and given that the the rental market is
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
such with such a too few units and such
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
demand people are definitely taking
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of that and I think even if it
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
happens a handful of times it it's
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
something we could address by putting
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
limits on application fees at least in
 
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.029 align:start position:0%
limits on application fees at least in
part

00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you well I mean what would prevent
 
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
somebody from doing that is they'd be
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
convicted of fraud so I mean there is a
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
there is a court system that will
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
eventually settle that I get I I guess
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
my question is the the intent of this
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
legislation is to prevent landlords
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
housing Provisions from charging too
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
much and not giving the money back so
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you with this amendment that
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
I've collaborated with representative
 
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
do you think that the landlord should
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
not be able to keep
 
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
the cost the credit check the cost the
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
background check which some are
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're taken sometimes
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
they're not so if there's no background
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
check that money's going back to the the
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
applicant and documented administrative
 
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.389 align:start position:0%
applicant and documented administrative
costs

00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
the documented administrative cost is
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
something that's of concern
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
to me because it's a very broad
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
statement and I am concerned about some
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
of the soft costs of renting I.E showing
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
an apartment
 
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
um hourly administrative fees for
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
checking credit for checking landlord
 
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
references and the other time that might
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
be spent could could be rolled into that
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern with the
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
administrative fees unless we can really
 
00:32:29.649 --> 00:32:29.659 align:start position:0%
spell it out what those fees could be
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
but I think I think that's a difficult
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
thing to do I mean surely like a
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
landlord would not say I'm gonna get
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
paid fifty dollars an hour to process
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
this credit check and if this happened
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
I would think that the courts would be
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
like all right that's kind of ridiculous
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
like if this was ever adjudicated
 
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:55.100 align:start position:0%
so I think that in my experience
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
especially the large property management
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
companies that are often out of state
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
and have thousands and thousands of
 
00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:02.810 align:start position:0%
and have thousands and thousands of
units

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
units
 
00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.730 align:start position:0%
units
are

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
are not looking at things from the
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
perspective of the tenants and it has
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
become a huge money-making uh
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
business for landlords and it's a huge
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
concern to me I don't think that I
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
understand many landlords are do trying
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing but there are also
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
many in any sort of business like this
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
that will take advantage and try to
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
maximize profits especially
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
when shareholders may be included
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
um just those maximizing profits issue
 
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
is a concern for me and I've seen it a
 
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
lot in working with the population that
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have the resources
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
to take somebody to court they would be
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
relying on legal aid and a lot of these
 
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
people struggling uh frankly simply
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
focusing on what they're going to eat
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
for their next meal what their children
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
are going to eat where they're going to
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
sleep that night they are not going to
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to pursue a legal case
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
to try and get a hundred dollars two
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars back it just does not
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
happen they are struggling often to fill
 
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
in the forms necessary to receive their
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
benefits on an ongoing basis
 
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.149 align:start position:0%
benefits on an ongoing basis
okay

00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you I see a lot of Merit with the
 
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
not overcharging and making a business
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
out of this so if if you have evidence
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
of any kind if you could let the
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
committee know about that because I'd
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
like to see if there's if this is a
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
widespread issue or as as I mentioned it
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
absolutely is and Murray's wearable can
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
probably alter also attest to it we
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been collecting data on that but
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I know of many people that
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
have been in that situation thank you
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else said wish to
 
00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:06.970 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else said wish to
testify

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:06.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for having me
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
today I'm Maurice warble I am the CEO of
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
the front door agency located in Nashua
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh today I am actually
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of those we serve and
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
also as a landlord ourselves we
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
currently own 67 units of housing to
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
serve the lower income to moderate
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
income families in Greater Nashua area
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
one of our programs that I really want
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
to highlight today that is affected
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
specifically on the this bill is our
 
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
security deposit program we issue
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
annually nearly a hundred thousand
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
dollars in security deposits to families
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
uh this past since July of this year
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
we've issued 26 security deposits
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
totaling over forty thousand dollars to
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
date and of that the average has been
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred and sixty two dollars
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
with the highest request being two
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred and fifty dollars
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
most of the families who have applied
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
for security deposits for us they have
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
seen they've had an income of about
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
forty thousand dollars in annual income
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
for a family of three are mostly single
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
parents and the average a number of
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
Apartments they've had to apply for
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
before getting this apartment has been
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
over eight eight to nine applications
 
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
they've had to submit
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
some of the families have been pushed
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
out of current Apartments because
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
landlords are selling properties and
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
they're given 30 days to move out
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
obviously they're now in in dire need of
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
finding new places and they're putting
 
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.099 align:start position:0%
applications in everywhere and the fees
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
have been so exorbitant it's actually
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
set them backwards without the ability
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
to even come up with a security deposit
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
for a new apartment
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
these fees even at the the seven percent
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that was suggested at a
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
security deposit of 26.50 that would
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
still be a fee of 185 dollars that a
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
landlord could charge I think most of
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
our families could not afford that
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
so what I would love to see as a
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
landlord for us we understand that
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's a cost of doing business we
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
obviously want to have the most uh the
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
best tenants the ones that will pay the
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
rent every month the ones that don't
 
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
have felonies on their records and of
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
course doing a criminal background check
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
I feel is is a cost of business if
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's what we want for a tenant so for
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
that I I think it's important and we
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
would be absolutely in favor of
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
recognizing that and disclosing that to
 
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
our attendance so that we're not taking
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
funds from them to say what we are
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
looking for in an applicant but having
 
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
that that there's always exceptions to
 
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
every rule in the bill which this bill
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
clearly highlights
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
so so with that I would love to see
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
obviously the lowest administrative fee
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
um representative Alexander I think your
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is great if we could put some
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
type of limit on an administrative fee
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's one percent or two percent
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
that could of the total rent that could
 
00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.270 align:start position:0%
that could of the total rent that could
be

00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
um charged that would be
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
I think would help a lot and I don't
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
think the landlords would necessarily
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
object to that I I personally would not
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
um although we don't charge anything
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
obviously for our clients when we're
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
doing that also we received support from
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
the greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
has submitted a letter of support of H
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 283 and a letter was sent to
 
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander on behalf of
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill because it does
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
affect the business economy as well in
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
Nashua our housing encampments are
 
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.329 align:start position:0%
Nashua our housing encampments are
growing

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:31.339 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
industry is finding it hard to get
 
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
Workers because of again they're
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
applying to several Apartments some that
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
do exist and some that don't so we we
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate any support in getting
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
something passed to protect everyone
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
involved in our community thank you any
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
any questions go ahead representative
 
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
Oregon um yes thank you um so you've
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
been on both sides of the uh you're
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
working on both sides of the landlord
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
tenant divide when do you and I'm sure
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
it uh takes a lot of time and time is
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
money you know to show the apartments to
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
the credit checks and all that but when
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're doing that are you I mean
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
obviously both parties benefit are you
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
primarily you are primarily providing
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
the service to the front door agency
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
rather than to the tenant is that
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
probably a correct view of it correct
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
yes all right thanks
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much for your time
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
is there anything anybody else I would
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
wish to speak on this
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to open it up to the
 
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.790 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to open it up to the
committee

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
um could I get some thoughts from
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
my friends across the aisle on what has
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
been said today and
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
give me some feedback on specifically my
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh representative Kenny thank
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so regarding the
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
administrative costs you just got a
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
suggestion for language I was wondering
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
how you felt about that
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned with the capping it with
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary number I don't like the
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
seven percent number I don't like I I
 
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.170 align:start position:0%
seven percent number I don't like I I
think

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
I feel comfortable enough for lying on
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
the courts to really
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
set a precedent if there is some abuse
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
in in the law but I think when you have
 
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
documented administrative costs I think
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
a judge can see through when it's like
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to keep the money as
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
opposed to their trying to run their
 
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
business so I I don't like throwing an
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number in there but I think if
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
they can document and prove that it is
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
is like just time that it takes to
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
process it I think that is a reasonable
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
thing uh can I follow yep
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so you keep bringing up the court but
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
a good point was brought up that a lot
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
of these tenants would not be able to
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
afford the cost of going to court which
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
is expensive so how do you mitigate that
 
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.910 align:start position:0%
is expensive so how do you mitigate that
issue

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
um with what you just said well I I mean
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
legal New Hampshire legal assistance is
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
here too so I I think that in some of
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
these cases these cases would be brought
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of 10 other groups of
 
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
tenants tenants right organizations
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
things like that but I don't
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
I don't see
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
a world in which a landlord would get
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
away with this for a very long time
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
without it being like taken care of one
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
resident set go ahead
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
um so this is going to the other
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment because he brought up seven
 
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.690 align:start position:0%
Amendment because he brought up seven
percent

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
um does language that follows that
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
unless the landlord provides
 
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.089 align:start position:0%
unless the landlord provides
documentation

00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.099 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
um to kind of prove if if they need to
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
go higher than caps does that not make
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
you feel more comfortable with having
 
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.569 align:start position:0%
you feel more comfortable with having
caps

00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
I I'm just not in favor of the like
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
putting a number on it
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
um understood my position thank you
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
represent representative De Lorenzo do
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
you have anything
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I have a question
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's kind of glitchy
 
00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:52.550 align:start position:0%
it's kind of glitchy
um

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
for the Alexander Amendment
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
last paragraph
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
um line 14.
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
states that nothing in this paragraph
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
shall require the landlord to conduct a
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
criminal background or credit check
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
check or prohibit the landlord from
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
renting to an applicant who does not
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
pass the criminal background or credit
 
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.630 align:start position:0%
pass the criminal background or credit
check

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
and my concern is a fair housing concern
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
um I believe that under the fair Federal
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
Affair housing regulations that all
 
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
properties owners are subject to
 
00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
properties owners are subject to
um

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
require that
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
applicants be treated equally for
 
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.470 align:start position:0%
applicants be treated equally for
instance

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
you would not want to
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
let's say of the Smith's family in a
 
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
Jones family for the Smith family you
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
run credit check criminal background
 
00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:46.190 align:start position:0%
run credit check criminal background
check

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and landline references then you have
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
the Jones family
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
um for that family you don't do any of
 
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
that screening
 
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.849 align:start position:0%
that screening
um

00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:55.859 --> 00:42:57.109 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
you accept the Jones family but not the
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
Smith family or vice versa then you know
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
everything things need to be equal other
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
things being equal
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's my concern
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
I think and to answer your concern I
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
think the fair housing act really
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
protects the Discrimination based on
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
protected classes so
 
00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:16.730 align:start position:0%
protected classes so
um

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
if there was any inclination that a
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
landlord would not rent based on
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
somebody's race or sex or something like
 
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
that that would be covered under Fair
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
Housing but I think in general the
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
landlord has the ability to
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
conduct a background check or not
 
00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
um and rent to somebody or not and they
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
can't just not rent to somebody because
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
they're a different color than them
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
legally correct right yes so uh
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan do you have
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
anything to add yes go ahead well what I
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm somewhat uncomfortable with the
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
whole notion of charging people
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
especially people who don't have
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere to live and probably don't have
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
much money a fee
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
for a service which actually doesn't
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
benefit them directly I mean if they get
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
the apartment that's wonderful and
 
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully they'll be happy there but I'm
 
00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
not sure why
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
I understand it's real cost but I'm not
 
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
sure why the landlord uh
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be paying for that out of the
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
rent out of the income for the business
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
rather than expecting you know these
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
people who are out on the street and
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
have no money to pay for it it seems
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
like a little unfairness involved and
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
also talking about the documented
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
administrative costs um well first of
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
all once again the
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
the service is being provided to the
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
landlord not to the tenant but us and
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
the Tenant if they're accepted we'll be
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
paying a very large amount of rent
 
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
probably more than they can really
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
afford and also many times
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
many times like for example the woman
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
who sent us the email and I guess I
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
won't mention their name even though her
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
name did get mentioned because I don't
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
know much about her Pacific situation
 
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
but often you know they're a sole
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
proprietor or they have an LLC that they
 
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
own with a few other investors so
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're they have a dual role
 
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
um they do role both as uh you know both
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
as an employee either of themselves or
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
of the entity they're running for and as
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
an owner so I'm not sure
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure really why they're it seems
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
a little it just seems a little strange
 
00:45:17.329 --> 00:45:17.339 align:start position:0%
to uh expect the the applicant to
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
compensate compensate them for that you
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
know so that's uh I just find something
 
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
a little bit seems just a little bit
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
abusive I'm I'm I mean understand the
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
need maybe to have a a token a token fee
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
and even the seven percent of the
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
month's rent that seems pretty steep but
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's fair but I really don't
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
know whether
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's fair to expect the um the
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
applicants to pay for the process pay
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
the full cost of the process and yet
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
they're at their application that just
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
seems somewhat fundamentally unfair
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
although I'm certainly willing to
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
compromise in a token amount and maybe
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
even that percentage is acceptable but
 
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:52.910 align:start position:0%
even that percentage is acceptable but
um

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
so I feel I feel a bit uncomfortable
 
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
with some of the uh some of the language
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing from the landlords
 
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
even though I recognize you know they do
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
deserve to make a profit they do deserve
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
to make a living and it's not an easy
 
00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
job I've dabbled in myself it's not
 
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work involved and the
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
other thing
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm and one other thing we sort of
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned fifty dollars an hour is an
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
unfair amount and it that is certainly
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
beyond the capacity of the average
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
person who's looking for apartment to
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
pay but actually
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
if you're making you know decent middle
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
class income most of these landlords
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully they are making you know a
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year or Mars
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
which divided by 2 000 hours of work a
 
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
year is fifty dollars I know I mean
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
I feel serious dumb saying that because
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm paid a hundred dollars a year plus
 
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
mileage but certainly uh actually the
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars an hour I mentioned is not
 
00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:43.490 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars an hour I mentioned is not
excessive

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
excessive
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the recipient is
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
getting well it's certainly it's
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
excessive in terms of what the
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
applicants can afford so I
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
I understand this is the real cost but I
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
sort of feel like this should probably
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
be paid for out of the rent you know the
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
you know the rather than rather than
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
expecting the tenants the prospective
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
tenants to pay it before they even get
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
the apartment
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you so uh my question is
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
where's the committee at on
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of landlord tenant
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
bills in judiciary
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this is probably one of
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
the only ones
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
that we can find a middle ground on so
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
looking to the committee to see where
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're at on amendment 2286. I personally
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't think I could support anything
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
else other than that but
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
um with some minor changes to it
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
so the only change I'd make to 2286
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
line 10 and 11 the and the criteria for
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
a satisfactory criminal background check
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
if any
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
um so the disclosure of the fee
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
there must be a disclosure of the fee
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
if there's a background check or
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
criminal check done that can get taken
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
out of the fee but if there's not a
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
criminal background check that goes back
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
to the applicant
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
minus administrative costs
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
so I I personally think that this solves
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
the problem the anecdotal problem
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
that we've heard from the public
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't add any or much more
 
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
undue burden on housing providers I
 
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
think that they're
 
00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
think that they're
um

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
so we have to report back as a
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to the Judiciary Committee
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
so if this
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously I if we took a vote
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
right now I think I'd be out voted so
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
um if there is uh any anything you'd
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
like to add that'd be great okay
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
um this is a question for you
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you can answer it
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to speak on
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
behalf of the members of your caucus but
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
how do you think your caucus would react
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
to the Reed Alexander Amendment with the
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
changes you just said
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
I think with the backing of
 
00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:09.290 align:start position:0%
I think with the backing of
um

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
housing providers and other people I
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
think that we could get
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
I mean if if all stakeholders are on
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
board I think that it should be
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Horgan one thing that
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
came up which
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
with the criminal background check I'm
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
actually reasonably comfortable with
 
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
letting that be subjective because uh
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know if
 
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
like because you know like what we heard
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
about the person at a low credit score
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
but then they were told and who knows it
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
was true but she believed it that this
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
person never uses credit cards and pays
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
for everything in cash and hence had no
 
00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
credit history yum which I certainly
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
find that's certainly fine if that's
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
what you believe the case to be to rent
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the person rather than somebody else
 
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
had a higher credit score and also the
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
criminal background check you know
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
depends on the nature of the crime and
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
what you feel comfortable with uh with
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
having it so you might
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
might feel okay somebody has a
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
felony for something that doesn't really
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily make them a bad a bad tenant
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
versus somebody might have
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
what might actually be lesser charged
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
but it involves like violence or
 
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
something else that you find that you
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
just don't want going on in your units
 
00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
you could it should be free to uh you
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
should be free to accept some people
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
with criminal records and some who
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't probably every landlord
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
will have a different opinion about
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
what their willing to risk have going on
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
as units and what they don't so that's
 
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:41.809 align:start position:0%
as units and what they don't so that's
fine

00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.819 --> 00:50:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny
 
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this is appropriate Miss
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
chairman but could is there any chance
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
that Democrats could caucus for five
 
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
record I think we would prefer the
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
original build but in the sense of
 
00:56:28.859 --> 00:56:30.589 align:start position:0%
original build but in the sense of
compromise

00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
00:56:30.599 --> 00:56:31.970 align:start position:0%
compromise
um

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
I think that online of your Amendment on
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
line 13 moving the word documented to
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
before the word background so it applies
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
to all background check credit check
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
um and then adding the word reasonable
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
in between and or an administrative
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
um so we don't CA we don't cap a hard
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
number but we put reasonable correct I'm
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay with that yeah and then we'd be
 
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
satisfied okay so I also want to cross
 
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.790 align:start position:0%
satisfied okay so I also want to cross
out

00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
is representative Reed taking notes or
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
do we have to because she would run over
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
to OLS
 
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.410 align:start position:0%
to OLS
um

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
line 10 after the amount of the fee
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
crossout and the criteria for
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
satisfactory criminal background check
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
if any
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing I want to do is
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
move this from A3 to A4
 
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
that is away from the penalty section I
 
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
Nick is that does that move it from the
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
panel does that solve your penalty
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
problem penalty probably
 
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead just turn your mic on for us
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
this way okay uh not quite
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
section three
 
00:57:55.619 --> 00:57:57.349 align:start position:0%
section three
um

00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
without getting right into the or so a
 
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:02.420 align:start position:0%
or the way I remember it is
 
00:58:09.609 --> 00:58:09.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
540-a colon 4 talks about what the fees
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
so you could leave this in a colon 3
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
and address the amount of the fee in a
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
that would be the way to do it
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
or just move this to an entirely
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
different section and I couldn't tell
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
you what other section to put it in but
 
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
eighth a-3 defines what's prohibited and
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
a Dash 4 talks about exceptions to the
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
fees and if you don't put an exception
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
if you don't put in exceptions then the
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
fee becomes a thousand dollars per day
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
which of course is you know
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
unreasonable totally unreasonable so
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
they take a little bit of research
 
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
to do that language exactly right and if
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
you want some support on that I'm sure
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
that my team can easily
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
give you some guidance on that
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
okay so the the text of this language is
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
fine you're just now concerned about the
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
location of it
 
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.950 align:start position:0%
location of it
well

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much time you want to
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
give me but
 
00:59:26.089 --> 00:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
um if you take out
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh documented Administration costs and
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
that means you're not allowing the we're
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
not taking it out we're going to add
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable that's not what I heard
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
I heard and take out the word documented
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
um move the word documented up a few to
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
in front of the word background so
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
actual cost of the documented background
 
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:47.780 align:start position:0%
check credit check and reasonable
 
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
but that sounds okay that's what I've
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I have to run it by my team
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
but that sounds okay
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
to be clear the location is the only
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
concern here so we can move this
 
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere else you could I I don't know
 
01:00:07.089 --> 01:00:07.099 align:start position:0%
how complicated that'll be it might be
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
logistically complicated in in the RSA
 
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.030 align:start position:0%
logistically complicated in in the RSA
because

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
a colon 3 is the section of prohibited
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any language
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
recommendations to cover this penalties
 
01:00:19.619 --> 01:00:21.170 align:start position:0%
recommendations to cover this penalties
area

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
I was going to say perhaps we should
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
talk to a lawyer at OLS or something
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
yeah about the appropriate section
 
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.210 align:start position:0%
yeah about the appropriate section
okay

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to ask the committee
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
with those changes if those are made
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
is everyone comfortable voting on an
 
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.890 align:start position:0%
is everyone comfortable voting on an
amendment

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
like what we just discussed and knowing
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we have to figure out the proper
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
section I am yeah
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
okay is there anybody
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
do we need to vote we don't need to vote
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
is everybody okay with this change
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
all right so representative Reed do you
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
take a stroll with me
 
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.430 align:start position:0%
take a stroll with me
okay

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
lovely what a great end to the day all
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
right is there any other business
