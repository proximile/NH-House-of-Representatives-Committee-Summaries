home and we're going to hear from the
 
00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
new later at 10:30 the New Hampshire
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
hospital Glen Cliff home Hamstead
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
hospital so today is
 
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
basically uh chairman Edwards I'm sorry
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
yeah we have a question over here
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
introduction because no no go ahead I
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
must have been boring you go go ahead
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
what finish I just I wanted to be sure
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
you saw me okay so uh so today is uh
 
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
direct uh care day and uh a lot of
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
people talk about
 
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
priorities uh you know families are
 
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
priorities children are priorities
 
00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
pregnant women are priorities refugees
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
are priorities we have a ton of
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
priorities ities but I I personally
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
think we can't have any higher priority
 
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
than uh taking care of the patients that
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
are that we are directly responsible for
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we have care providers doing the
 
00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
handson care to me uh that's kind of the
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
first order um so uh so I'm a little
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
biased about today uh I have some
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
general questions I'm going to ask but
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
um uh but other than that I I I I that
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's my context for today uh rep
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative walner yes thank you and
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you I
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be sure that you that you
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
saw that I had my hand up um there's a
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
couple of things that I've been
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
wondering about the first one is last
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
week on the house floor we uh had the
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates from the house Ways
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee and then we put them
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
on the table those are usually what the
 
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh finance committee has to work with
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
and I think probably everybody here
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
knows that they're about $500
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
million less than what was in the
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
governor's uh proposed budget and I
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
wondered I know that some of the other
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
divisions one of the other divisions at
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
least has seemed to be working on a
 
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
Target I don't know what their target is
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
but they seem to know what they're where
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
they're going and I'm wondering if you
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
have any information for us about this
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
Division and what we'll be looking at as
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
far as future work on the budget and
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
possible reductions in um in
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that is a really great
 
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 align:start position:0%
question one that I'm not prepared to
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
answer at the moment but before the end
 
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
of the day I'll answer it great thank
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate that I have just one
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
more okay I think I heard you yesterday
 
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
on um say that on Monday we're going to
 
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
be working on
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
bills and um do we know how many bills
 
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
we have coming to this Division and this
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
will be division work or when we say we
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
I I think you mean the Royal we and that
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
includes uh Mr
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
Ripple oh yes Mr Ripple of course so
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
I'll actually need to check with Janet
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
and see how many bills have been
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
assigned to uh division 3 so I'll see if
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
I can get you a number
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay you have another Well I just wanted
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
to follow up with that one
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
um what will the process be and how much
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
time do you think you'll allow for each
 
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
bill I haven't looked at them yet I just
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
sort of did a mental note as we went
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
through in the house on Thursday you
 
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
know bills that had FNS that seemed like
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
it could hit us um it felt to me like
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
there were three or four okay um I I I
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
thought what we would need to do is um
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
spend about an hour hour on each okay
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then uh anticipate needing to um a
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
soak time give us each some time to look
 
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
at it independently and come back on a
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
second day to do um a recommendation for
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
the full finance committee so I was
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
thinking two bites of the apple one to
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
Tee It Up give everyone some time to
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
think and then a second day to uh get an
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
assessment from the division three what
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
we should tell the finance committee
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay one other question will they be
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
listed in the calendar um sometimes
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
people are confused about what the the
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
process is in the finance committee once
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
the bill comes over here my Mike I know
 
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh my my goal uh and I think Mr ripples
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
on top of it is is we're going to be
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
able to get it into the calendar with
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
the bills that we're going to look at on
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
Monday okay great thank you very much I
 
00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and representative Mooney
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
and I have talked about how we had made
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
an attempt to get a policy person here
 
00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:05.990 align:start position:0%
an attempt to get a policy person here
for

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
71 and um I I and we've decided that
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to escalate our directness
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
and our our uh request to to make it
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
more clear that they really need to be
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
here good I think that'd be really
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
helpful so representative Mooney thank
 
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
you for that I just wanted to make
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
mention that yes I want to push for that
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
in that the sponsors or members of the
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
policy Committee of these bills should
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
really be appearing in front of the
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
divisions when they're referred to so I
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
will do my best to uh notify these
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%

source and it's let's say it's the
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
educational fund to one of these
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
divisions and it's like three million
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering if what's the
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
policy for that to take money from a
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
fund that is supposed to be earmarked
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
for public education and it's going to
 
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.470 align:start position:0%
for public education and it's going to
another

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
department you're asking a question I
 
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to because I don't
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
I'm not in division 2 and so I'm not
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with the the policies around
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
protecting the educational trust fund I
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh so what I'd like to do
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
though is I'd like to because they only
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
had 30 minutes the veteran home go ahead
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
because we should finish them at 10:30
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
i' I'd like to get that going and then
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
we've got uh three uh care providers up
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
after that so so if you if if we haven't
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
figured out how to answer your question
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative priest let's let's do it
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
after we get through
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
these all right so uh I think we have
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
the commandant of the veterans home
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
ready to come up
 
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
agitant good morning for the record I'm
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
Kim McKay I'm the commod at the New
 
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans home we did provide
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
you with a PowerPoint presentation that
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
we'll go through um but as always you
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
can stop me at any time I love to brag
 
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
about the veterans home so sometimes I
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
get a little uh passionate about it so
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
um Can Can I can I give you a clue to
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
help guide your testimony uh because we
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
basically have uh 18 minutes I'm going
 
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
to be fast so so what we're really
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
looking for is is are your big rocks the
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
things the things that you're that are
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
influencing your ability to care for X
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
people how many people are waiting
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
Services what do we need to get do to
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
get those people Services just really
 
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a strategic uh look down into
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
your operations okay I I hear you so
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
I'll skip the where are we who are we um
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
just besides saying that we're a
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
long-term care intermediate facility uh
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
we only serve veterans that were e
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
either on their DD214 left for service
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
out of New Hampshire or reside in New
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we are licensed for 250
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
beds we are budgeted with currently for
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
225 veterans um and we utilize the
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
Veterans Affair uh Affairs grant program
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
enabled under uh 38 CFR 5141 and that
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
allows us to have reimbursement on a
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
daily uh prum amount for our residents
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
to share the cost of them being there um
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
I our mission statement just I want to
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
just do want to say that is to provide
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
the best quality for the life of the New
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veteran with dignity honor and
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
respect um some of our achievements I
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
will kind of just leave this here in the
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation we've created an
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
LNA program to try to combat our biggest
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
issue is Staffing um and we were working
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
on trying to cut energy cost saving some
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
of those uh monies with uh a project
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
that was placed to replace lighting and
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
we have been able to um provide Wi-Fi
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
now for our residents but I want to do
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
want to say that uh our wait list was
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
sometimes over a year and uh we have
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
seen a huge um decrease in that because
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
we've invested the the staff in those
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
areas so our admission weight list
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
process is now 3 to 6 months which is
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
really a great
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
achievement all right so I'm going to go
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
on what we have right now so right now
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
we have 135 veterans in the home today
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
and we have another four Veterans
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
schedule to come in we still have about
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
after that 36 uh people that are in
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
application process so our goal is to
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
get our census in in the next um
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
probably by in two two months or so we
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
want to move to about 150 with our
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
current staff we think we can meet the
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
needs of the veterans uh at 150 veterans
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
with our current staff the long-term
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
goal is to fill our positions that we
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
have so that we can go to that 225 preco
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
era um and have the needs do we think we
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
can fill the beds that's what I'm always
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
asked are you going to be able to fill
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
the beds I believe we will be able to
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
fill the beds because if we added our
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
weight list in our current census we
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
would be in that 100 high 170 Mark I
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
think what happens in the community we
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
have to do a little bit of that PR is to
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
let people know that it's not a year
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
plus or 2year wait to get into the
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
facility that were able to move people
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
in much quicker and so those veterans
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are home or in a crisis and they
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
need placement right away they don't go
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
to a a a different nursing home and then
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
have to be transferred over that's
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
Staffing so we have some new people on
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
the division since last budget and I
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
just want to acknowledge uh two really
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
big things that have uh happened in in
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
in the last two years um one the the
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
wait time to from an application to
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
actually be admitted is is incredibly
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
good relative to the how long it had
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
been so congratulations and thank you
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
and and also appreciate you having a
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
manageable uh weit list of people who
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
are who are getting in that's that
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's great progress in two years I'm
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
looking forward to see what it is in two
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
more years the second thing is you guys
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
had been struggling to create a separate
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi network for your residents and
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
that was causing all kinds of issues and
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
it's sounds like you've got that now and
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
that it's really uh been embraced and is
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
really valuable to the social networking
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the and that sa life satisfaction of
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
your resident so so I right away those
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
are two really great things thank you
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
sir thank you thank you uh we did Wi-Fi
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh we know that being connected to your
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
family helps quality of life and um I
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
jokingly say when when we say at a
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
meeting to please silence your cell
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
phones I have to say that during
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
meetings some times because the veteran
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
cell phones are going off all the time
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're really connected to their
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
families and that Wi-Fi project was also
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
not just want getting the Wi-Fi but it
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
was also updating our conference room so
 
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
that if a loved one can't travel in the
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
winter for a care plan meeting where
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to discuss what their spouse
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
is getting for care they can actually
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
zoom in or teams call in and they can be
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
in the meeting with us so that this week
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
and last week were those Technologies
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
were being put in our conference rooms
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
so we're excited about that thank you
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement um again uh we our
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
biggest um hurdle is Staffing and we're
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
trying really hard to uh continue with
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
advertising uh going to anything we can
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
speak at being part of college uh fairs
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
signing up for things like handshake um
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
anything that's available to us one of
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
the pieces that I did put in this year
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
is that we have a learning management
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
system that's going to be electronic
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
so that people can take take their
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory trainings that they have to do
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
every long-term care has to do Resident
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
rights we must do abuse and neglect
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
training we've never had ability to give
 
00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
uh ex continuous education units CEUs to
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
our medical staff our nursing staff we
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
now are going to have that ability to
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
provide cus that doesn't sound like a
 
00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
big recruitment um uh tag but it is to
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
be able to say to a nurse or an LNA or a
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
physical therapist you can come on our
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
team you're going to do your mandatory
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
trainings that we all have to do but
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to have free cus
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's a very small investment for us to
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh ensure education's happening but also
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
to promote that so so I understand
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're outside um you're not part of the
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
no sir we stand so the other Direct Care
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh providers like the New Hampshire
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
hospital you you don't necessarily have
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
a direct relationship with them you
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably have a professional one I
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
assume I to what extent have you been
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
able to cooperate with each other to
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
leverage professional uh training
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
programs like I'm sure uh the department
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
has a learning management system I don't
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
know if you have a learning management
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
that's where we're get we are now going
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
to be putting into place yes are are you
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
getting it on your own are you going
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
through the department of it to get it
 
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
we're getting it with o doit they they
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
had to uh check this as well and it's
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
really focused on it's called Healthcare
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
Academy and it's um focused on the
 
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
things that have to happen in long-term
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
care those kind of focuses that we have
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
so I would assume a good deal of overlap
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
on the kinds of professional training
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
and CME that you you all need has got to
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
be pretty similar to the New Hampshire
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
hospital it would be nice if you guys
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
could have some some coffee talk someday
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
to figure out how you how you can help
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
each other that sounds great good point
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
okay representing wner did you have a
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
question earlier I found the answer all
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
right thank you okay
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
representative novano just a very quick
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
question for my my understanding is the
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate start I mean sorry the lit
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
time starts at the approval um no it
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
starts the day we start counting you the
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
day that you actually put your first
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
application in so in the past the
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
application process is so multi-layered
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
you would need to get information from
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
the family you would need to get bank
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
account information for the VA we need
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
to get medical records so if you see a
 
00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:58.039 align:start position:0%
primary care physician in three
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
specialists we had to get records from
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
all of them but there wasn't enough
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
staff in our admissions Department to
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
really help push that through so
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes they would linger and now
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
we're able to say to the family let us
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
help let us call and get some of that
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
information and that's really what
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
shortened up the time so when we say the
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
wait list it it's really from the start
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay so it's a actually so you can't
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
admit somebody until all the paperwork
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot so the the real weit time
 
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
is actually even better than 3 to six
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
months if you could you know which
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
shorten if you could speed up the the
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
paperwork yes I I I I hear the number as
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
from the veterans point of view from the
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
day I drop a completed packet it's going
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
to be three months before I have a bed
 
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
that and that and that's and that's the
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
waiting period that matters is what what
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
it feels like to the veteran but is that
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
is that what the three to six months is
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
3 to 6 months depending from the day
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
they put their application in and to
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
that we are offering them a bed we're
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
offering beds so quickly now that some
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
families were still under the mindset
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
they were have a year or two before they
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
had to make a decision that they're
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
saying thank you for approving me but
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
we're not quite ready can you give us
 
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
two months and so it's interesting that
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're at that point and sometimes
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
we get people who uh apply that is 80
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're 85 years old they're hike we
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
just had a gentleman 85 years old still
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
hiking three miles a day with his dog uh
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
drives does all of his own things but
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
the age sounds like he should be with us
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
but's not ready for us he doesn't meet
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
long-term care requirements so yeah
 
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative priest and representative
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
Stringham thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Miss McKay for your service
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and for all you do um question
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh do you have the same coordination
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
with the nonprofit organizations that
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
provides housing for Veterans so if they
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
have a client that's Health it's
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
declining do they notify you and help
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
the client to process the necessary
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
paperwork to get a hospital bed yes sir
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
so we have uh many ways that people are
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
referred into us from the VA working
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
with the veterans and having social
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
workers at the seox or even the main
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
campus we have people in the community
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
that will make referrals church people
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
who will have someone in their Parish
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
who needs to have some support uh
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
neighbors most commonly families um but
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
they come in different ways so uh our
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
RSA wise anybody who is homeless is
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to take an advanced stand on our
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
weight list our weight list is not like
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
a deli number where I I'm Number One
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
You're Number Two you're number three we
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't do it that way we look at it from
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
our RSA standpoint of your risk what is
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
your risk if you're living at home or
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
homeless um and you don't have support
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
staff that's much different than
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
somebody who is in another nursing home
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
wanting to transfer into us so we look
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
at all of those pieces and when somebody
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
comes to us that is a homeless vet they
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
take a higher higher uh stance on our
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
wait list thank you you're welcome pres
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
string I I think you answered this
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
question later on but I was going to ask
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
about the churn meaning how many uh
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
people are leaving uh the Veteran's
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
nursing home and uh on a regular basis
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
and the veterans themselves yeah um so
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
most often our veterans pass we have an
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
average age of 83 which means um we have
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in their 90s we have one
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
gentleman who is 100 um one of we we age
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
from 61 years is our youngest 100 is our
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
oldest and so we normally see about 45
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
um people pass a year so we have a lot
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
of people coming in and a lot of people
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
going out the average time that they
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
spend with us is about 2 and 1/2 years
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
and that's average some people come to
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
us um at the very end of their time and
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
then some people people will live with
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
us for five or six years um so a lot of
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
people come and go uh very few are
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
discharged but we do have some success
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
stories where they got better they were
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
able to go back out into the community
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
and that's been great too and uh follow
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
followup um so it it looks like most of
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
the current was weight list is
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
applications in process do you have
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
adequate staff to process four to five
 
00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
applications per month yes that's why
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a weight list from a year
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
to two down to 3 to six months I'm very
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
job all right um on slide 10 we just
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
talk about the census and you can see
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
that covid really affected the veterans
 
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
home and we're slowly creeping that up
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
the slide that we were just talking
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
about on 11 is the discharges and so
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
when we say discharges that usually
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
means they've
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
passed military branch always put that
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
in there because there's a lot of
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
competition it doesn't matter uh what
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
branch you served in they all like each
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
other but they're going to ask where you
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
served and uh and if you're a marine
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
you're going to take it a little tougher
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
because uh but they say they can handle
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
it so we we let that go um and then we
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
do a conflict era we're seeing a lot of
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
our uh World War II veterans pass um
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's sad to see that um and we are we
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
still have one um we have one Gulf War
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
and I I'm assuming that we'll start
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
seeing that uh increase but the more
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
larger majority is our Vietnam veterans
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
that are with us right
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
now the vacancy moving to what we are
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
talking about for Staffing our vacancy
 
00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:41.799 align:start position:0%
rate still is overall about
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
35% um now some of that it can be
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
misleading because I'm purposely holding
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
some of those positions because we're
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
not at a census at 225 so I think it's
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
not I think it's fiscally responsible to
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers to say don't fill
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
positions just to fill them because you
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
have them unless you have the census of
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
the veteran and those are only in areas
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
like um extra housekeepers cuz we have
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that are closed um some
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
laundry workers because we don't have
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
that laundry the one thing that we will
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
never close down on recruitment is
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
nursing and lnas those are our those
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
people are the ones that drive our
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
census for our veterans the more nurses
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
and lnas you have the more veterans we
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
can have and so we we will always be
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
recruiting for them um and how do we do
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
that I was uh having a conversation
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
prior to this I believe that it's not
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
really a recruitment issue that we have
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
with the state of New Hampshire and it's
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
not unique to me it's a how do we retain
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
people how do we keep them in state
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
service because we can hire them they
 
00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
come on but when we do exit interviews
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
we are it's very clear that people are
 
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
leaving for higher pay bonuses different
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
hours um and some are leaving without
 
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
benefits they're signing up for
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
temporary um the contracted nurses and
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
doing contracted work because they're
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
getting paid so much more if I'm a if
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a laundry worker in a a health care
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
facility such as myself and some of the
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS sites we're handling laundry that
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
is contaminated and so if we're getting
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
paid 13 or $14 an hour then and I can go
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
to a hotel and make a lot more money and
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
not contain handle that contamination or
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
or I'm in McDonald's and I'm making $16
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
an hour and I'm making a cheeseburger
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
cheeseburger a burger with no cheese
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
much different than making a prior diet
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
knowing the allergies of our residents
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
the likes and dislikes it's much more
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
serious and so we're seeing people leave
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
for those reasons so it's a retention
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
issue go go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
what is the tenure usually for your
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
nursing staff how many years do they
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
kind of stay with you before they um get
 
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
a better offer it's difficult to say
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
because we have some nurses that have uh
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
been with us for 20 plus years many 10
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
um we do longevity through the state and
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
I give longevity Awards out every
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
quarter many many nurses the ones that
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
we see in come are the ones that are
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
usually younger um are going to other uh
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
positions uh lnas when we have lnas come
 
00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're moving when
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're younger they're moving to other
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
places with bonuses and sign-ons and um
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
can I get 12 hours can I only can I get
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
paid for 40 hours and only work 32
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of creative things that
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
the private sector can do that we can't
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
as a state and every time we we increase
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
the wages for our staff the private
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
sector is much more uh fluid and can
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
change their wages really quickly so we
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
got wage increases that brought us to
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
even with everybody but as soon as we
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
did that all they had to do is increase
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
the wages a little bit more and we don't
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
have that a fluid or that ability to do
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
you quick question I want I want to jump
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
ahead oh go ahead represent do you have
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
any contract nurses now we do sir yes um
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
we we have uh a handful of them and
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're both basically focused on that
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
second shift we have people that work
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
third shift if you're a third shift
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
person and you're a night owl you're
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
usually a third shift person and first
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
shift is easy to fill where we feel the
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
biggest pain for us is on that second
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
shift and so we do have second shift uh
 
00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:38.389 align:start position:0%
shift and so we do have second shift uh
contracted

00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
nurses uh do regular staff who take the
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
second shift get um added payment second
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
shift for nurses is an additional $4 an
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
hour um but for lnas it is not they're
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
not treated in the same way so it's $160
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
an hour for lnas um one of our one of
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll see move is to match the
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
lna's licensed nursing assistance to the
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
same payscale um or shift differential
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
that nurses experience because it's $7
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
on third shift it's $4 on second that's
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of money that what you're looking
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
at your salary are those percentages
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
though they they end up as dollar
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
amounts but did they start as
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
percentages no they're straight dollar
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
amounts that they've been negotiated
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
through the contract the the Union Yes
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
um did did you did you go ahead what's
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
your question good question yeah quick
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
question it's a follow on to
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative stringham's question so
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
the 30 uh the you know between about 40%
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
average U of vacancies so part of that
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
is covered by contract nurses and and I
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
guess overtime or yes yes sir overtime
 
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
because that's a fairly big gap and I
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
was just wondering how
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
well we I also don't fill the census to
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
the where so the census I don't have 225
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
residents so I match the census of
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
veterans to the vacancy rate so that I
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
we're providing the quality of care so
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
we don't we're not running at 225
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
Veterans as
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
well okay so if you if you went to the
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
150 you you'd have to cover more with
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
contract Andor nope we're going to cover
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
it with the current staff we have so
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
we're on Monday we're changing the way
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
we have some of our neighborhoods to uh
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
to add more uh the staff with the same
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
same staff will be able to do more
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
because we're reconfiguring some of our
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods so we're going to be able
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
to go safely with this number of staff
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
to 150 150 residents um and we do that
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
with uh something called PPD patient per
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
day hours so how many hours a patient
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
gets a day we really look at those
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
formulas so we're making that decision
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
of how far we can go with a very uh
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
objective tool to make that happen so I
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
just want to commend you for uh the
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
creativity and doing more with less
 
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
sir okay so on 19 U this this is this
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
appears to be your whole budget request
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
and it's probably a page in the budget
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
are you able to tell us what page this
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
is on do you have the page numb
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
Y for the record Jennifer do CFO of the
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
veterans home um this is just a rolled
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
up summary page of our entire budget I I
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
know but can you tell me what page
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:43.870 align:start position:0%
 
1,65

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
two I'm trying to get the
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
end that's all right it looks like 170
 
00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:50.870 align:start position:0%
end that's all right it looks like 170
170

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
170
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
170 70 okay so I I I want to ask you
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
about your prescription drug expenses
 
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh and the management of those
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
are you are you on your own are you on
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
an island uh negotiating and getting
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
your prescription drug prices or or are
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
you part of uh the VA system and then
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
they just back bill you for what you use
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
how do how how's your how's that work
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a we have a a pharmacy
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
contract um and so we contract out our
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Services they're on site but
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
they're a contract they're not
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
state-owned we do have reimbursements
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
through through the VA depending on the
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
person's disability and um and the
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
medication so we can build the VA for a
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
medication that's associated with the
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
disability that they have and we do that
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
so we have about um right now I would
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
say $30,000 comes back each month on the
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical cost from the VA the rest
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
is on us and we have a formulary that we
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
follow for the VA so that's how we
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
actually do it is through the VA so so
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
if if you were just to boil it all down
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you you don't have any control over
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
the pricing and you don't have any
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
control over the volume because the
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
volume is driven by what the Physicians
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
prescribe right true so so you're
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
basically just a pass through entity on
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
this line item for things that you can't
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
control true and we oh sorry I so so so
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
with the new Administration are they
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
talking or have you beg to hear anything
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
about what they might be doing to um
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
help Control prescription drugs because
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
this is pretty big jump from year to
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
year right right so one of the things
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
that we are working on right now is
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
something called catastrophic disability
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
applications and so the VA is taking
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
applications for people who live in the
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh in the state veterans homes and if
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
they qualify for catastrophic disability
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
which we have seen some of them all of
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
their medications will be covered from
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
the VA so we are seeing we I we
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we will see this line
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
have a lot of money at the end but we
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
are not positive um about
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
that um yes so there's also some large
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
cost medication uh bills that are
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
underway uh Congressman uh papis has
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
signed on and he is going to be bringing
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
a bill forward through the National
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
Association of State veterans homes for
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
high cost medications example we have a
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
medication right now that one veteran is
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
on and it's $5,000 a month for that one
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
medication and so we have asked if they
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
that veteran was in a nursing home in
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
the community the VA would pay for that
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
medication but because we get VA per DM
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
rates from the VA we have always been
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
exempt from actually getting those money
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
those monies reimbursed to us so we have
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
brought that forward to the house and
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
the US H the US CER uh the US House is
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to be bringing a u Bill forward
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
asking for an exemption for high cost
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
medications and that the VA the Veterans
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
Home can build a VA for those
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
medications that we have always been
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
exempt from so we're hoping this line
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
does not need to be this High yeah but
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
at this point we're projecting what we
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
are based on what we have right now and
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
projecting on a
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
225 census if we had 225 veterans this
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
is what we're projecting so you're
 
00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
basing your prescription drugs based on
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
a full 22
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
so this is probably overstated by quite
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
a lot 4% we hope so but we also don't
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
want to um hinder ourselves by not doing
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
being able to do admissions based on not
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
having enough money and are these
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
General funds here these are all General
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
funds right or go ahead so so I guess
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
the federal government does give us some
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
money for that it's roughly 24% and 76%
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
General funds 76% General funds okay um
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'll come to you in a second and and I
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
think you have um a fourth Revenue
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
stream that we were talking about
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
beforehand where there's uh you all
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
because so many supporters for there are
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
for veterans that you guys have sort of
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
a off the books um account system where
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
you can receive donations yes let me
 
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
speak to that because it's not and and
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
the state oversees that whole thing so
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
all the you know fraud waste abuse
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
issues are managed yes sir but that
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
money stays off the books until you need
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
to transfer it over into the state
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
system to um to to to buy something
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
whether you use a a purchasing card or
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
contract it's got to come over so that
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
you can spend it through the state
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
facilities right yes so and from your
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
own fund you don't do any direct
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
purchasing at all it all goes through
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
State systems right so well we have two
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds one is called the
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
membership account and that's all of the
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
residents have check they have
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
individual Check accounts in that that's
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
through uh the a dedicated fund the
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
donation account you're talking about
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a revenue resource I just want
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure we the state doesn't use
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
that money to do anything um with not
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
the state but you but our benefit our
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
res you you do as a common this is
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
another asset class abely absolutely and
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
that's all donations that come from uh
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
people in the community veteran service
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
organizations example Christmas is we uh
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
asked people to sponsor Veterans for
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
$75 we can't use taxpayer dollars to buy
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
them Christmas gifts and so how do you
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
do that how do you provide for them how
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
do we pay for cable TV we don't use
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to pay for cable TV we
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
use our benefit fund and that's all done
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
through the dedicated fund which is has
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of oversight um first from the
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
board of managers that overseas us
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
as well as we go to GNC to accept all
 
00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
our donations we're very transparent
 
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
about where our money comes from and
 
00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
where it goes so so the reason I'm
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
dwelling on this this is mostly for the
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee I think is because this idea
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
of having donation accounts set up for
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
other entities has come up um in other
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
places like we have an hb2 the
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
department wants to uh be able to
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
collect up to
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and I I just thought that the way
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
that the vet Veterans Home is doing this
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
may be a metaphor for some of these
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
other things and you don't have a
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
ceiling I think you told me that you had
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
one donation of $100,000 for example yes
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
yes right and sometimes higher we uh are
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
Beque money sometimes uh and sometimes
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
they the family may actually want you to
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
do something with it we recently had a
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
$10,000 donation where they wanted us to
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
put some improvements in our Physical
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
Therapy gym um and so if they ask us to
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
spend it in a certain way we will do
 
00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
that if they don't then we use it for
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
General so so so for those following
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
Along on page 49 of
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 line 16 is a has an has a number 95
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
there that or 96 that talks about gifts
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
to the state and so I'm just I'm just
 
00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
wondering if we already have a metaphor
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
here that we should be adopting and I I
 
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't like that thousand limit
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's online 20 so it seems like we can
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
change that number substantially as long
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
as we're consistent with what however
 
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
you're set up did you have a question
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
rep I representative n
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
Von very quick question what's the
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
typical balance in that fund it it's
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
none of our business in a way right
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
right I mean they don't I I mean I I I
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to pull words in our mouth
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
but but one of the beauties of that fund
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
is it's none of our business it's it's
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's money that are being provided
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the veterans it's under management
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the state to make sure no one's
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
stealing it and that it's being
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
transferred over and and um and if it's
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
not enough money they can go ask for
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
more money right so the only time we
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
touch the state with that is that we
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
have a line an accounting line that um
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
we will put in money so I think of it as
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
like a debit card if we're going to buy
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
Christmas gifts on um on our PE card we
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
need to put money from that account
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's the members or the benefit fund
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
and it goes into the state account so we
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
can have it flow through but that
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
account is has a lot of oversight and I
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
just want to say that we don't spend
 
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
that money without approval from our
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
Board of managers there's 12 members in
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
the community that are on that board of
 
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:46.839 align:start position:0%
managers every uh quarter we talk about
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
what we're going to spend and how we're
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
going to spend it and we're always
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
looking to I'm using you as an example
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
of of something that we may want to
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
leverage so representative priest
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um on your revenue
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
streams on page 18 uh on the VA
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
um with the current climate in
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
Washington where there's being Cuts made
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
and cuts were recently made in the
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
VA what reductions are you seeing that's
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
filtering down on your budget great
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
question so uh we always get a little
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
worried when we hear that there's any
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
kind of holds or um issues with the
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
budget we've been reassured that the
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
veterans uh State veterans homes are not
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
going to be affected that this money
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
will still flow through and we have had
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of times when the uh in the
 
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
past the government has kind of closed
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
stopped and um we still have gotten
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
payments so we don't see any worries
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
right now and we've been reassured as
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
much as we can on a regular basis that
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
this this funding source is going to be
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
there um in fact we're seeing an
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
increase of uh getting more VA funding
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
because we're able to uh with the packed
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
act uh sign people up for a higher
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
disability rating and so they get a
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
bigger um benefit to them and we get a
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
bigger uh PDM rate and you'll see in
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
number one when you look at the cost and
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
how we get if they're u under 70% we get
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
a one rate of $144 a day if they're over
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
70% we get 800 uh excuse me $587 so it's
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
a big significant difference and so we
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
think we'll see more funding not less
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
funding okay we're running short out
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
time um you guide me and I I think you
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
want to talk to us about uh page
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
20 yes do you want to talk about that go
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
ahead all
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
right we would love the ability to be
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
transfer um between classes and to be
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
able to put money in the most effective
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
way to use for the veterans there are
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
some limitations in some of our County
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
units 47 48 um and others in in the
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
ability to transfer um we don't want to
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
go against uh going to fiscal or GNC for
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
that oversight we want to still do that
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
but just have the ability to so let me
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
throw a cynical case at you and tell me
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
how how this would work it sounds to me
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%
like your prescription drug line might
 
00:45:22.559 --> 00:45:23.309 align:start position:0%
like your prescription drug line might
be

00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
inflated so if we pass this in hb2 would
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
that it set up an incentive for you to
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
inflate your prescription drug so you
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
can transfer it into other accounts
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
later we could so so so I'm a little
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about that um I I I think I
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
think I think the members need to read
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
this and we may need to get in touch
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
with you to talk about it some more
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
because I I I don't want to
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
create okay we work in healthc care and
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
so there's always some great thing that
 
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to fund in healthc care
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's sort of the Untouchable thing that
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to fund and so I don't I
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to create a an incentive in
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
the system to to Really fund the thing
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
that everyone is attracted to and then
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
have the money leak out to the other
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
places where it's it's needed so I I I I
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
don't want a lot of that but but you but
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
I I know that you need flexibility and I
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
so there's maybe a different way of
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
doing it but I just want to point out
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
this was language that was in there in
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
last the last budget we were we did not
 
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
have a budget manager we did not have a
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
CFO and that's how it fell out we didn't
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
so this has always been in this language
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
has always been in there it fell out
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
this last budget because I didn't know
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
um and the person that was trying to
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
fill in didn't know so this is why we're
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
asking for it to be put back in there
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's not new it's just something that we
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have the ability before so um
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
ethics are still there you still have to
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
be able to say why you want that money
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
in that line um but I hear what you're
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
saying there's a concern of over
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
inflation to be able to move this um so
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're we are again asking just sort to
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
have that restored so honestly I haven't
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
read this or thought about it so but but
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
but I will okay thank you representative
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh three questions um um the
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
other um uh parts of uh DHHS people who
 
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
present here division 3 uh have have
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
largely unfunded positions that were
 
00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
open is anybody asked you to do the same
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
thing or sir so these POS so the budget
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
assumes that all those positions would
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
be filled yes sir and um last year you
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
spent about 34 million I think uh isn't
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
it a fair assumption on our part that
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
there'll probably be a considerable
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
lapse um in the forward budget of 50 to
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
52 million um when we get through the
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
next bium uh by the time we get there I
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
hope to fill all the positions but I I
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
can't I can't speak to to what will
 
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
happen I I mean our our goal is to keep
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
filling them and retain them and those
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
positions would be needed if you're at
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
full capacity but I can't go to it's
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a catch 22 I can't go to full
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
capacity until I have the staff to
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
provide the care so that's why we're
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
doing this when I first came on three
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
years ago we had a cap of 121 veterans
 
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
and that was where our staffing was
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
today we feel that we can go to 150
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
safely and meet the needs and still be
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
within the VA requirements and our
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
certification um so we are creeping
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's three years but uh going from 121
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
to 150 I think is a good growth and so
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
we just want to keep getting back to
 
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
where we were prior to co so if you were
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
at the full capacity I mean right now
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
you obviously don't have the wait list
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
for that do you think more people would
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
be applying absolutely okay thank you
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely um at the at at grafting
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
County um the numbers that we we uh came
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
up with uh converting a traveling nurse
 
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
to a full-time nurse is saving the
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
county about $50,000 per employee uh per
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
year uh going back from being a traveler
 
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:18.799 align:start position:0%
to a full-time in-house staff even with
 
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
salary adjustments do you think those
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
numbers if you know would be similar
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
here I think if we could fill our
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
positions we would save a lot more money
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
than paying for travelers Travelers are
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
very expensive they're only there for 13
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
weeks you have a lot of uh getting them
 
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
onboarded and so you're investing that
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
education but then they're gone in 13
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
weeks honestly uh most of them resign
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
with us so we are getting longer than 13
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
weeks um and some have actually switched
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
over to be full-time employees once they
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
come they fall in love with the veterans
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
and they stay um but we know that that
 
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
is not it's not sustainable it's not a
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
good way to spend and monies we need to
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
fill them with full-time positions but
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
we can fill them how do we keep them is
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
the is the question how do we keep the
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
healthc care engaged with the state of
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at the
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
salaries so representative tki and then
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative priest super quick I'm
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
just wondering going back to page 20 if
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
Kevin could maybe do a little dive into
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
previous budgets to see where that
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
language dropped out and how long it had
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
been in
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
place I can do that I know it was in
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
place in the 2022 23 budget I'm not sure
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
how long prior to that it had uh been
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
there thanks and and then I'd like your
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
advice Mr Ripple if you if how we might
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
be able
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
to tighten this without messing up the
 
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.030 align:start position:0%
to tighten this without messing up the
flexibility

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
but okay I can think about that
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative priest um a
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
question along with the representative t
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
tris's uh question um are other
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
departments do they have this provision
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
already within this
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility um transferred funds and was
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
the veterans the only one that was
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
dropped in the last
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
budget no this transfer Authority would
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
be broader than what other departments
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
have in
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
statute I see thank you a a question uh
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
for you um Miss McKay are you
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
able to have a program for college um
 
00:51:32.599 --> 00:51:33.829 align:start position:0%
able to have a program for college um
tuition

00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
forgiveness for nursing and l
 
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
lnps l LPN um to come and work for you
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
for like 10 years and have their college
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
tuitions forgiven if they did that we
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
don't have anything like that but I will
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
tell you that one of my um dreams would
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
be able to have and we just knew that we
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't put it in the state budget this
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
year is to sponsor and grow within so
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
right now we are growing lnas licensed
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants they may come um and
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
work in housekeeping or laundry and they
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
love working with the veterans and they
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
become lnas so we have an LNA program um
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
and they commit to a year and what we
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
can't do is create nurses so I would
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
love to see us invest in our staff and
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
say if you're an LPN and you want to
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
become an RN it's a one-year bridge
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
program if you want to be an if you're
 
00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:27.559 align:start position:0%
an LNA and you want to be become an LPN
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
a one-year bridge program we invest that
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
$25,000 uh four times two LPNs to nurses
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
and full RNs and one uh two lnas to LPN
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
we would be investing and we I think it
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
could be a recruitment a retention you
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
ask them to stay um but it's just
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
something that we knew that we couldn't
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
put in the budget we were already asking
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
a fair amount for the budget but that
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
would be something that we'd love to see
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
so you're talking something aspirational
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's not in this budget not in this
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
budget um we already knew that we were
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
asking for quite a bit here um and so we
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like we could push it that
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
far all right we we've gone long I think
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
we've had some good uh questions and
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
answers um do you do you have I know I
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
rushed you and made you skip some pages
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
you have it so so before you go away if
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's something you wanted to say that
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
you've not yet said here's your chance
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh that the Veterans Home is a very
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
unique place it's a wonderful location a
 
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
a wonderful campus and if you're
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
available to come and meet our veterans

okay I'm wrapping up do you have
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
something yeah I do one quick question
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
and it builds on I think something that
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
rep representative priest asked and
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
partially representative Edwards
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
cooperation I I've recently I'm familiar
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
with a um an outside organization Harbor
 
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:27.150 align:start position:0%
with a um an outside organization Harbor
care

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
and I think one of their big
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
priorities U that I attended a
 
00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
fundraiser for is their focus one of
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
their focuses on uh homeless veterans
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
yes and they're I believe it's an agency
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's funded through
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
DHHS that and I'm wondering if there any
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
cooperation yes we have a relationship
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
with them as well with referrals I think
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
okay great glad to hear that okay well
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%

are over a million dollars annually and
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
Todd thank you for having us um I will

try and be as short as possible as well
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
um the first you know is our our Mission
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
our division mission is to strive to
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
provide a continuous services to New
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's developmentally uh
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled and mentally
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
ill population in a h likee atmosphere
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
with an emphasis on Independence dignity
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
and acceptance um so we are very similar
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
to the veterans home we just serve a
 
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:12.990 align:start position:0%
to the veterans home we just serve a
different

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:15.799 align:start position:0%
population um the next slide talks about
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
our RSA
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
135c and then our administrative rules
 
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.710 align:start position:0%
135c and then our administrative rules
um

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
hm700 you know again uh we are a
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
certified CMS uh licensed nursing home
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
um so we have to meet all the
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that that that entails and
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
then we specialize in serving people
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
with mental illness and developmental
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
disabilities um it lists out all the
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
services we provide which is you know
 
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
typical for any uh nursing
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
home next slide shows where we fit into
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
DHHS and how we relate with the finance
 
00:58:57.549 --> 00:58:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
moving on some quick key accomplishments
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
um unlike the veterans home um we do um
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
strive to get people back out into the
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
community as much as possible um which
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
has been a cultural change over the last
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 years um so we are proud to say
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
that in the last 5 years we've had 50
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
residents discharged to uh other
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
placements of their choice um a number
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
of those are into Community placements
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
um we also as the comant mentioned
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
strive to grow our own uh we have an LNA
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
program and an m&amp; program an m&amp; is an
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
LNA that has taken additional training
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
and and can help nurses pass medications
 
00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:39.799 align:start position:0%
so we have had huge success with that
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
and right now we have four lnas um
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
enrolled uh so that'll help and then the
 
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
last accomplishment we listed here is
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
that um continuing to improve our
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um we have um you know
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
started replacing our Waste Water System
 
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
um for those those of you that haven't
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to come up we are
 
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
completely off the grid um so there's a
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
lot of infrastructure
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
there next uh slide kind of gets into
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
the more we have a question very quick
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm impressed by your um nursing um
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
training program that you have going are
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
most of those people um locals to the
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
area that's great yes yes um and a lot
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
of family members um I believe right now
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
three of the four students we have are
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
related to other employees so it's a we
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
try and grow it that way as well great

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
for the state system uh once that's
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
installed and we see that it actually
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
works as well as adverti we are going to
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
get a starlink system just for the
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
residents to have Wi-Fi um which is a
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
huge demand you know as quote unquote
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
younger folks come in over the last 20
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
years they come with phone and and
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
tablets and and laptops and um are
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
usually very distressed when there's a
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
huge lag that they can't um communicate
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
with their loved ones or watch the shows
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
and things that they want to do so yes
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
shortly I think you can continue uh the
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
next slide is um our sensus information
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
um you'll see a a fairly significant
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
change when it comes to fiscal year 23
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
so um at the end uh to explain that in
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
the end of fiscal year 22 we chose to
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
freeze admissions uh due to Staffing uh
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
right now and we have for a number of
 
01:02:40.269 --> 01:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
years now have about a 50 52% vacancy
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh nurses and lnas so
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to safely maintain the
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
population we um capped ourselves at
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
75 um and while we were doing that then
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
the uh Governor sonunu uh decided uh as
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
part of the C uh CMHA the um Center uh
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health agreement uh to
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
keep that cap in place to the end of
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
that uh agreement um and uh till we can
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
hire more staff um and that's why the
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
numbers have gone
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
down are are you going to get to the a
 
01:03:17.789 --> 01:03:17.799 align:start position:0%
slide that talks about um your weight
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
list uh I don't have a specific slide
 
01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
but I can answer any questions yeah yeah
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
so so give us if you wouldn't mind a um
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
a sense of of a couple of things um you
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
you are trying to um um discharge
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
patients out into various Community
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
Alternatives correct um you do have some
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
number of people that I assume you have
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
good visibility over that want that need
 
01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
to be admitted to Glen Cliffe uh I I'm
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
just curious uh how big a population
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
that is and and what they're doing for
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
services until you get admitted they get
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
admitted because you you provide such a
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
unique environment I I I can't
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
imagine those Services being available
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
to an individual in the
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
wild um you're correct so um at the
 
01:04:12.029 --> 01:04:12.039 align:start position:0%
moment we have 19 people on our waight
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
list um a a lot majority of folks come
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire hospital in other
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals so they're being maintained in
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
a safe place while they wait to come to
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
us um we do um also get applications
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
from other nursing homes um they've
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
admitted somebody and that now has um
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
behaviors or um diagnosis that they
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
can't um help uh them with so they'll
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
refer them to us but again they're in a
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
safe place similar to the veterans home
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a homeless person that uh
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
has uh an application in uh they get
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
priority uh to come in we get a uh Fair
 
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
number uh in the last few years of
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
referrals from Doc um from Corrections
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
either individuals that have um finished
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
their uh term and uh can't find
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
placement anywhere else um or somebody
 
01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
that has become um medically um
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
discharged basically from docc uh so we
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
have a large number of those folks that
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
other nursing homes aren't able to or
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
interested in providing services to so
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
all the people on our weight list are in
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
a safe place uh like I said if there is
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
a homeless person we will um move them
 
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
to the top of the list we recently just
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
had a um for example an individual that
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
came from docc who had finished his term
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
they contacted us about weeks before his
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
end date and they basically said you
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
need to take him or he's going on the
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
curb um they didn't really say that but
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the intention so um we
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
moved him to the top of the list we we
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
moved as fast as we could and we got him
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
um uh admitted um two weeks ago so um so
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
it's a great question um you know we get
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
a people from a variety of places uh and
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
we do serve a unique um
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
population we also uh you know part of
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
our sense of staying kind of stagnant
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
where it is is due to moving people out
 
01:05:59.309 --> 01:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
into the community um the department has
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh had an RFP last vium um with NFI to
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
create um group homes um per se and
 
01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
those have come online um so this year
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
we've been able to discharge um 11
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
people back into the community um we
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
also then have what's 11 like is that 11
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than previous years
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes significantly if you if you look
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
back 10 years maybe we would discharge
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
one person to the community and now
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
we're we're you know doing between you
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
know 8 and 12 a year okay um is what
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
we've been averaging and part of that is
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
the system itself amping and having more
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
um placement availability so so for the
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
people who are looking at this for the
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
first time I I I think one of the
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
challenges we have um with your
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
inability to have a higher census number
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
is there are institutions like the New
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital that we're going to
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
hear about that are also having some
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
some overflow problems and weightless
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
problems and they can't free their beds
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
until they have a bed to move some of
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
their patients to and if you're one of
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
those people and you can't handle them
 
01:07:10.829 --> 01:07:10.839 align:start position:0%
then then that's that's where we're
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
finding uh blocks in our our patient
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
flow correct correct and we and we do
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
give priority other than the homeless
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
folks we do give priority to uh
 
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
residents that are patients that are at
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital um but they have
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
to be clinically stable enough um
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
obviously the hospital is an acute
 
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
setting um so if there's somebody that
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
isn't quite safe enough in their
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
behavior for themselves or to our other
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
um residents then you know they might
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
need to stay at New Hampshire hospital a
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
little bit longer but we work extremely
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
um tightly with New Hampshire hospital
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
um uh to look at what what can we meet
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
their needs um and what's safe for
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
everybody else but yes that we are a a
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
backdoor solution for New Hampshire
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
hospital I I I think I interrupted you
 
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
on Page Six if you want to pick
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
up um I think we may have covered it all
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to explain why there was
 
01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
the dip insid of census um you know as I
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the last uh 12 months we
 
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
had 11 discharges back to the community
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
we also had um seven residents um uh
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
pass um so that's kind of why we've been
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
staying about the same numbers then it's
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
also related to to the Staffing I think
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
representative Nano has a question yeah
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Edwards uh quick
 
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
question on you said 19 people on the
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
weight list correct and and this is a
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
fluid weight list because some people
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
are jumping but what's the average time
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh on on your weight list so that that's
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
an an interesting question to answer um
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
so um it is very fluid so similar to
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
what the comant said we it isn't like
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know you take a number and you you
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
get first first come first serve a lot
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
of it also depends on the paperwork that
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
was mentioned so of those 19 we have um
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'd say nine right now that are we we
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
quote quotequote uh active but if you
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
put an application in today and you're
 
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
diligent about getting all your
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
paperwork done and in addition any
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
individual that has a guardian has to
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
get a probate court permission to come
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
to us so if you can get through the
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
court we can admit somebody in as little
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
as three to four months but the average
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
is about six months um that being said
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
there are some people on our wait list
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
that are not clinically ready um so
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
their application has been submitted our
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
second iatrist and our clinical team
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
will review them and say we'd like to
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
see them on this new medication another
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
month or two so it might drag out a
 
01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
little bit for those types of reasons
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
and then similar to what the comment I
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned some people will also put
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
their applications as a placeholder
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
they're still doing okay at home like we
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
have a lot of situations where you know
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
somebody's being managed at home by
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
their elderly parents who are now in
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
their 80s they're planning ahead so they
 
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
put them on our wait list so that they
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
can start getting the paperwork and
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
stuff done um but the paperwork is is
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
very arduous it it it can easily take
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
three or four months to get everything
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
done again if that's if the family is
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
being very diligent so it's so it's
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
actually better than it looks if you
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
just hear the 19 number correct okay
 
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.830 align:start position:0%
just hear the 19 number correct okay
thank

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
you uh any other questions on
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
census uh the next slide uh speaks to
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
our vacancy rate um I mean it basically
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
speaks for itself but I will highlight
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
that you know out of the overall
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
vacancies of a 37% % that's all
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
departments if you look us at nursing
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
nurses are at 51% vacancy rate Ln are at
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
52% vacancy rate and you know that's
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
again on
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
General very similar to the the comant
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
again I'm sorry I keep repeating what
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
she's saying but second shift is our
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
real challenge LNA is on second shift we
 
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
have a 66% vacancy rate um so that
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
that's where our biggest draw is is
 
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
trying to cover that that shift um and
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
we have the same shift differentials as
 
01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.310 align:start position:0%
we have the same shift differentials as
mentioned

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
previously why what what's driving the
 
01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
shift do do you they negotiated with
 
01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.669 align:start position:0%
shift do do you they negotiated with
their

01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
Union it's all state employees union oh
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
it's a state same Union okay so we have
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
the same shift
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
differentials and and as she advocated
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
for I would love to see the lnas beyond
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
the same shift differential as the
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
nurses but um that is well it's not the
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
same the same percentage Maybe
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
that would certainly help right shift
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
differential is you know 40% it should
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
be 40% for whatever hourly wage you're
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
making that's what it was when I was an
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
hourly worker the union has negotiated a
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
set dollar amount right so it's not a
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
percentage again we um you know do
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
everything we can to recruit um very
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
similar to was I mentioned before we
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
advertise we go to reach out to schools
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we try and grow our own as
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
much as possible um and those kind of
 
01:11:58.990 --> 01:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
things so it our remoteness does help uh
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
hurt us a little bit you know we we
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
compete with Grafton uh nursing home uh
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
we we trade staff back and forth every
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
once in a while um but we have the same
 
01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.590 align:start position:0%
once in a while um but we have the same
similar

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
challenges any other questions about
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
Staffing representative nalco yes thank
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
you chairman quick uh Bill a question
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
that uh our representative priest asked
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh previously in the last
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
presentation is do you have any uh
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
program that helps with uh I I know it's
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
pretty commendable on what you're doing
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
with nurses is is part of that tuition
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
payments or uh forgiveness we do not
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism to provide tuition
 
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
assistance other than um through the
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
department but nothing no forgiveness
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
programs uh we do try to do everything
 
01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
we can to support that we do have a
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
couple of employees that are taking
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
nurses classes so we will adjust their
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
schedules so that they can uh still work
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
and uh attend classes is if possible we
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um try and assist them doing their
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
clinicals with us so again they can work
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
while they're getting their clinical
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
credits uh so we try to be as creative
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
as we can but we do not have a mechanism
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
for uh tuition reimbursement so I mean
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
you have tremendous success and we
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
commented on that on the number of uh
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
graduate lnas and m&amp;as uh is that
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
something that you're doing that can be
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
replicated someplace else because that
 
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
looks like a fantastic success rate um
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
Yes actually the veterans home used our
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
curricul um um you we the Comm and I um
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh have a a very good working
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
relationship she actually worked at Glen
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
GFF home for a number of years um so uh
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
we piggy back off of each other and and
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
try and use each other's creative ideas
 
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
try and use each other's creative ideas
thank

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
you let's talk drugs so I would expect
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
you to have a very high drug bill I
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
would assume all of your patients are
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
fairly heavily sedated or what or
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
medicated well not sedated um medicated
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh Med yes um however um we don't pay
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
for the medications um because they are
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um recipients um we have a
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
contract with a pharmacy Health direct
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
and they bill um Medicaid directly um so
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we pay for is any
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
over-the accounter medications like Tums
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
and Advil and things like that so it's
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
so you have a very small bill for
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
General funds to pay for yes yes yes and
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
thankfully because the psychotropics are
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive so okay
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
um what what else would you like to tell
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
us you've got you've got some financials
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
here on a on a separate sheet in your
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book is there anything
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
to um in the uh the Professional Care
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that that begins on page
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
984 I I think one thing just to point
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
out there just to be consistent with the
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
other conversations that we have had is
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
there are uh 54 positions that are
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded there I don't know if you want
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
to speak to that the nurses lnas um yeah
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
so um in class um uh 5710 that's our
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
professional care so that is uh nursing
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
in activities and medical records uh we
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
had 54 positions um
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded um and that is 16 nurse
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
positions 37 LNA positions and then one
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
activities position um which were all
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
unfunded in the government So based
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
based on your funding level uh what's
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
the maximum or what's the best vacancy
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
rate you could come down to to maintain
 
01:15:43.679 --> 01:15:44.430 align:start position:0%
rate you could come down to to maintain
the

01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
75 well I I'm I'm I'm just looking at
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
this uh slide where you have your all
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
your vacancy rates yes and and I'm
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
hearing in that on page seven and then
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm hearing that there are some
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions correct so to me that
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
means we've built in a at least a
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
baseline vacancy
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
rate yes I would agree with that um okay
 
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
what what what's what's that Baseline
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
where if if we could drop the nurses and
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
um LNA vacancy from 50 52% to 30 even
 
01:16:24.239 --> 01:16:25.750 align:start position:0%
um LNA vacancy from 50 52% to 30 even
30%

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
30%
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
um that would um we'd be able to reduce
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
how much overtime we use we would
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
probably be able to um eliminate the
 
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
agency so to be clear on what you're
 
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
saying what I think you're saying what
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
I'm wanting to hear is that you have the
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
funding in this proposed budget so that
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
if you could find the people you could
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
hire enough of them to get down to the
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
30% vacancy rate uh those positions are
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
unfunded so so so so we've basically
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
inst institutionalized and built in a
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
permanent vacancy rate in your clinical
 
01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
care of
 
01:17:00.679 --> 01:17:02.310 align:start position:0%
care of
47%

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
47%
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
correct there's no funding available to
 
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
get you lower than
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
47% I I I'm asking because it's a little
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
incredulous but I I want I want to make
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
sure I'm I'm understanding sure so so
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
there there's there there's another
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
important component here that I just
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
want to draw your attention to so B
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
basically there there's over 50
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
positions that have been unfund within
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit um and then as as
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
Todd was indicating um there has been a
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
a utilization of agency Staffing so in
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
the prior in the prior year it was about
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
a million dollars in total and that's
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's used to uh hire additional nurses
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
and and others where where needed
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
currently we've spent about $800,000
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
year to date in this year and you'll see
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
that the contracts line on page 985
 
01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
class 101 it's budgeted at15 $5,000 what
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
we've typically done is when we go
 
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal uh Department wide
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
transfer process is we move money from
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
those vacancies over um the the hope is
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
obviously that we're able to fill those
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
positions but where we haven't been able
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
to fill we've used that money that is
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
now no longer available in order to fund
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
that agency contract so we will we will
 
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.669 align:start position:0%
that agency contract so we will we will
have

01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
challenges I'm still looking for a
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
baseline that's built in because of the
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
way the the finances are working are are
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
we are we
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
institutionalizing what the at a 40%
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate for clinical care or if we
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
move the money around we could get down
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
to 40% we could get to 30% I'm I'm just
 
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how how how how
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
much flexibility we have to get out of
 
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
our own
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
way for them to be able to hire to get
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
their census up to get the New Hampshire
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
hospital patients out
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
quicker sure so the the department I I
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
mean we have the ability to move money
 
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
around the department however when we do
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
have a pretty significant reduction
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
within one area that's obviously going
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
to make it more difficult because if we
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't have money to post a position then
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
we never have a chance of hiring a
 
01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
position I mean we're going to engage in
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
Dynamic ways that that we can but
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately when it's it's similar to the
 
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
back of the budget cut that we had two
 
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
years ago where we basically had to take
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
a couple hundred positions off offline
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
um I mean we'll work dynamically but but
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
this is going to be challenging
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
particularly when we've relied on some
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
of that vacancy funding to fund the
 
01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.229 align:start position:0%
of that vacancy funding to fund the
agency

01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
Staffing represent Str Ian it sounds to
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
me like like the way this proposed
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
budget is put together it's not workable
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
to even achieve the level of results
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
that you've gotten this time in order to
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
achieve the level of results when you
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
have open positions you use the excess
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
funds from H from the staff that you
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
didn't hire to use contract workers and
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
right now you won't have any source of
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
fund to hire contract workers therefore
 
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
we either have to rob from some some
 
01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
other part of the DHHS budget or just
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
not hire them which means higher uh
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
lower census not not um not a greater
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
census to reduce um the um uh your Your
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
Capacity um so you you know I'm just I'm
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we'd be better off uh
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
um you know funding more of these
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
positions and then having an expectation
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
of of some lapse in this department to
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
give you the flexibility you need to at
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
least keep up uh this level of um of
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
service to our community and I don't
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
know if if either one of you have any
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
comment on that or you can help me to
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
think about uh how we craft the budget
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
to help you succeed more money
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
one answer sure so I I I'm I'm gonna I'm
 
01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
G to make this even more complicated so
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
what one other thing to consider is you
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
know if if there if there's lower census
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
like if if we're not able to hire and
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
that results in lower census then that's
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
going to result in lower revenue and and
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's it's it's it's
 
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
obviously not a onetoone or a linear a
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
direct linear relationship but there's
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
certain challenges there I mean we'll as
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
as a department we would we would
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
effectively potentially need to transfer
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
um funds from some other program in
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
order to continue to sustain the
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
Staffing levels just because we will
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
have attrition at some point in time we
 
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:37.639 align:start position:0%
don't know when but um it it it will be
 
01:21:37.639 --> 01:21:39.550 align:start position:0%
don't know when but um it it it will be
a

01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
challenge represent seaworth thank you
 
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.189 align:start position:0%
challenge represent seaworth thank you
Mr

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to try to ask the same
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
question but slightly differently and
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
maybe there there'll be an answer so
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
those 54 unfunded positions how many if
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
you had to guess
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
are they're probably unfunded because
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find the people and
 
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.189 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find the people and
how

01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
many could you project that you might be
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
able to fill those if you just had the
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
authority to do
 
01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
it that that's a great question but very
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to answer um as Nathan
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned if they're not funded I can't
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
even post them so then I'm not going to
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
fill any of them um which is going to to
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
affect our census and the use of of
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
travel nurses um you
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
know off the top of my head I would say
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
we need at least a third of those
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
positions to be able to eliminate the
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
use of overtime and agency nurses and to
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
get um fully up to the one the 75 where
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
we're CA right now and give us a
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable uh margin for attrition
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
because um you know we we do have some
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
turnover um somewhere in here I wrote
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
down the numbers we we were able to um
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh hire uh 18 staff this year but 21
 
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
left um for the same reasons that the
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
comment was talking about you know the
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
the the pay increase that we got in the
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
last pum was great but again that
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
brought us up to average um not High um
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
so um you know when when Grafton uh
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
offers a higher rate that we have staff
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
you know transfer back to them
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
so if a followup I know we've had this
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
conversation at the County nursing home
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%
we've had it with
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
corrections and so part of the challenge
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
it it's the same thing you could save
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
money if you could hire that onethird
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
but in some cases the department heads
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
just know they're not going to get that
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
many people because they know how many
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
applications they get when they do post
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of of those onethird
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
could we actually hire them or is the
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
real limit like what we talked about
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
with the veterans home that there just
 
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
aren't the people applying and that's
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
really that provides a practical cap on
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh I would say it's kind of a
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
combination um absolutely um I we' have
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
certainly seen an increase in the last
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
year um versus the four before that um I
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
think as the um economy struggles we do
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
better um because we're the state in
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
people see our wonderful benefits um I
 
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
mean that's one challenge that I've seen
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
over the last you know number of years
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
is um the biggest attraction used to be
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
retirement and and benefits younger
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
people don't seem to care about
 
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
retirement anymore um and the Really
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
younger people who you know make up a
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
majority of new lnas stay on their
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
parents Insurance until they're 26 um so
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
they it isn't quite the draw it used to
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
be U so then it comes down to what we
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
pay on an hourly
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other oh represent
 
01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.350 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other oh represent
wner

01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
wner
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
so the traveling nurses are are just
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the Personnel line is
 
01:25:06.679 --> 01:25:07.550 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the Personnel line is
that

01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
correct so or do I see them someplace
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
else sure so so the the contract line on
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
page 95 that that that is that is low
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
and that the reason for that is because
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
we've budgeted the funds in the
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
positions under the the goal of being
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
able to hire those in the the long run
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
but in actuality like in this bium what
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
we've had to do is we've had to move
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
those dollars over where again last
 
01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year we spent about a
 
01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars on agency Staffing
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
year-to date it's about
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
$800,000 so far um as of as of this
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
morning um so so that that's been
 
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
intentional but when you look at that
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
contract line it's if you look at the
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
actual versus the budget there you
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll see the
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing the contract line can you
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
sure it's on page
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
985 the accounting unit is
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
5710 and then it's 101 medical payments
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
to Providers oh oh my apologies I was
 
01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
using the wrong language it's my
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
fault so could I follow
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
up so the actual expense was over a
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
24 and now it's I mean now it's going
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
down to 185 it's you don't nearly have
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
enough money in that category right and
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
and and that's more of a function of of
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
the budgeting process because we didn't
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to abolish the positions
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to keep the money in the
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
positions under the goal of being able
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
to hire those in the long run and that's
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
through the department-wide transfer is
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
where we'll move money once we've
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
confirmed that we're not going to that
 
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't filled those positions in
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
that vacancy drag and we move that over
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
expenses so in the fiscal year 24 the
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
authorized adjusted was very similar to
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
the 185 then we transferred money into
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
it to bring it up as we needed to to pay
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the the travel nurses and have we
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
not we haven't transferred yet for um 25
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
we we have transferred currently the
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
authorization uh the authority is
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
slightly less than 1.2 million in state
 
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 in that 101
 
01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.950 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
okay represent Stringham just to be
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
clear if it hasn't been clear to
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
everybody that the this budget isn't
 
01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.510 align:start position:0%
everybody that the this budget isn't
workable

01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
workable
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
because we fund positions from one
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
budget item that we didn't use from and
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
then we take all that money out since we
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
didn't use it and and instead uh we
 
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
transfer to another line item which is
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
the contract workers and we don't fund
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
that either so it's money we've actually
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
spent to provide the services at the
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
current level of care and census and
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
we've basically taken it out of of both
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
sides so in order for for this budget to
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
even be consistent with the current
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
budget it's got to be in one place or
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
the other uh with the flexibility to
 
01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
allow the department uh to move the
 
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
funds that where they can uh best
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
achieve the
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
objectives and this is the only time
 
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
I've seen it this dramatic so so there's
 
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
there's a two-step part of my response
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
to that one is I'd be happy to see your
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
proposal uh to make it to fix it and two
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
i' want to hear the department respond
 
01:28:46.639 --> 01:28:49.550 align:start position:0%
i' want to hear the department respond
to

01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
it I I I think representative Singham
 
01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
has um I identifi the the challenge that
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
we currently have where historically
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
again we've we've we've funded that
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
contract line out of the vacancy dollars
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
which are not there
 
01:29:04.119 --> 01:29:06.189 align:start position:0%
which are not there
now

01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and so what's your proposal
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
represent Stringham it sounds it sounds
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
like ultimately we need to come up with
 
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
more resources that aren't in the
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
forecast yeah we either have to fund
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
fund the positions or at least a portion
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
positions uh and um uh we could do it
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
the same way we did the veterans homes
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
which is continue to fund the positions
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
and then plan for a lapse because
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's clearly going to be a lapse in
 
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
the veterans homes um uh or I may be
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
able to think of something else yeah I
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
keep thinking because I think the
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
challenge to that is if um it the fir
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
the opening bid on that play is that we
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
need to find additional resources that
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
Means and and having a lapse a greater
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
lapse at the end would happen but our
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
issue is we have to submit a a balanced
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
budget so there's a limbo going on
 
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
here that's why we get the big bucks I
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
know I know and that's why I'm going to
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
the the smartest guy on the committee to
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
say what how how do how how do we fix
 
01:30:26.669 --> 01:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
this in a way that's
 
01:30:26.679 --> 01:30:29.229 align:start position:0%
this in a way that's
uh

01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:29.239 --> 01:30:31.709 align:start position:0%
uh
tenable

01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:31.719 align:start position:0%
tenable
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
but so so so what do you think it's your
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
budget it's your operation are you
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this budget can you can
 
01:30:41.709 --> 01:30:41.719 align:start position:0%
you uh operate your organization for the
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
next two years with this
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
budget um as Nathan responded earlier
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
that is our challenge is to figure out
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
how to continue to have the Staffing to
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
level oh man I I'm I I so wish you all
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
no uh I think currently if the budget
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
stays exactly the way it is we might
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to look at lowering our senses all
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
right there I can understand that thank
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
you representative tki I was just going
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
to comment on um the governor's budget
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
address and her commitment to the
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
members of our community that are the
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable and if I had to put a
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
label on your clients in Glen Cliff
 
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
hospital I think they fall under that
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
category so um if we can find some
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
solution um to help I think we need to
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
figure that out representative priest
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
um by what amount what percentage would
 
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
lower if the bu if this current
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget is approved how many
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
less nurses and what would your census
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
be so so currently so we have four units
 
01:32:15.149 --> 01:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
uh currently we are not using one at all
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
and then a second one we have um reduce
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
the number of residents on it and what
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
we are using it for is more of our
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
transitional unit so even though it
 
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
could hold 75 residents we have nine and
 
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
they're the most independent um uh and
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
most cognitive able to be um by
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
themselves more so we can staff it with
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
one or two um staff I think currently if
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
if if the budget stays the way it is we
 
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
would have to look at closing that unit
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
and condensing down to two um so we get
 
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
economy of scale Staffing and then we
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
would drop to a maximum of 70 um which
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
means we would probably average about
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
68 do do you have a prioritized need
 
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
that's been organized and submitted for
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
to to address the Personnel issue no the
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
the the agency budget was prepared back
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
in August and the the Personnel
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
reductions transpired after
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
that you in effect have a prioritized
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
need that we just need to document make
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
sure we understand what um I I I think
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
we can take it back and um and and we
 
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
can we we can provide a a document to
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
the committee that gives a little bit
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
more be called a prioritized need
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
anymore just because of the semantics
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
but it would have the same effect or
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
purpose more of a change request at this
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
point yeah
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay well great great very uplifting
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%

Hamstead hospital as the entire budget

has been zeroed out but we can certainly
 
01:35:05.229 --> 01:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
talk about that following
 
01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:08.440 align:start position:0%

far we do have a couple of additional
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
folks in the audience in case we have
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
some need for support in any of the
 
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
questions that you have um first off
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
without taking too much time cuz I know
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
that uh we want to be mindful of that I
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
just want to thank the uh chairman and
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee for all the
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
time that you've taken so far um as well
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
as the time being taken today to listen
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
to these budget conversations and to
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
really engage with us in asking um key
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
questions that can help uh be very
 
01:36:43.629 --> 01:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
supportive so thank you for that um
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that much like the Glen
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
Cliff presentation ours is pretty
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
concise and although the work we do I I
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily call the work we do
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh concise I do hope that we're able to
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
portray today um the necessary
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
information to share with you um and
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
cover any questions that you may have
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
sure so if we want to cross reference
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget what what page do
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
you start on do you know we'll be
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
starting on page
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
125 okay so if we can move to slide two
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
I'll just spend a brief moment on our
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
mission statement um to help citizens
 
01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
with acute mental illness stabilize
 
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
their conditions and live their best
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
lives um I want to Echo some of what
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard today as well as in other
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS presentations that we take a lot of
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
pride in this mission statement um
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's been conversations about the
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
vulnerability of the population served
 
01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
in the 247 facilities the same is very
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
much true at New Hampshire hospital um
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
and it it truly is our mission to
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
support them and help rehabilitate them
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
and return them to a community based
 
01:37:52.109 --> 01:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
setting um also as you know New
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital is really one of kind
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
in the state there are certainly a
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
handful of much smaller designated
 
01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities or drfs that make
 
01:38:05.229 --> 01:38:05.239 align:start position:0%
up approximately 6 60 60 additional beds
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the state however New
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital's capacity is 185 and
 
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
we serve the most acutely mentally ill
 
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
adults in New Hampshire in our nine
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
units if we can move to slide
 
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
three um again I won't spend too much
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
time here but um I mentioned our mission
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
in providing acute impatient psychiatric
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
care um I I did want to spend just a
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
moment on the admission process we do
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
work with various referring facilities
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
the the majority being um emergency
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
departments in hospitals Statewide we
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
also work with correctional facilities
 
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
for admissions and even with other
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facilities when
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
patients are too acute for their setting
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
and require a higher level of care uh a
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
main priority at New Hampshire hospital
 
01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
is of course safety in identifying um
 
01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
illnesses and treating patients and
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
helping them to achieve that level of St
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
stability in our efforts to uh
 
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
coordinate the most appropriate
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
placement of patients throughout the
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
state you've probably heard um about
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
Mission zero the mission zero initiative
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital is a key part of
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
that initiative and we're really proud
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
of the work that that entire uh Mission
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
has been able to accomplish and um
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the continued work
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
therein um a major part of mission Euro
 
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:30.679 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital in particular
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
is our care Traffic Control Department
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
or CTC um and through the implementation
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
of care traffic control which just
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
celebrated its one-year anniversary back
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
in January of this year CTC has really
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
become the central Hub of the referrals
 
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh Statewide and to some extent uh
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
patient placement as well CTC receives
 
01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
all of the state's IAS as well as other
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
legal statuses and refers those ieas out
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
to the other designated receiving
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
facilities based on their Collective
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
relationships and detailed knowledge of
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
capacity capabilities and established
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
routine meetings that New Hampshire
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
hospital hosts with the other designated
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities this work has
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
significantly enhanced the teamwork and
 
01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
collaboration Statewide um as part of
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
the mental health system and you'll see
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
some subsequent slides with information
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
on some of the things we've been able to
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish under this Mission zero
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
initiative if we can move to slide four
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
you can see um some of our staffing
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
information um this was information that
 
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
was submitted from the agency phase so
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
we submitted um 699 positions for New
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital 13 of them being
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
unclassified um and I'll talk about
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
those in a moment um some of the further
 
01:40:54.669 --> 01:40:54.679 align:start position:0%
breakdown shows that hospital
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
Administration staff is in
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
8400 8410 is primarily our operation
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
staff such as Environmental Services
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance laundry food and nutrition
 
01:41:09.589 --> 01:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
Etc uh 8750 is really the bulk of our
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
staffing it includes unclassified
 
01:41:15.550 --> 01:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacists as well as clinical staff um
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
which could be nurses Nurse managers
 
01:41:19.629 --> 01:41:19.639 align:start position:0%
mental health workers social workers
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
dietitians Etc um and then just for
 
01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.750 align:start position:0%
dietitians Etc um and then just for
clarity

01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
um accounting unit 6096 was the unit
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
that supported the path program that was
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
our Philbrook adult transitional housing
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
program this program remains in
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
operation um in the Philbrook building
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
currently it was stood up originally in
 
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
2022 by New Hampshire hospital in
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
transitioned um in the last calendar
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
year over to um NFI for oversight and
 
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
operations and that is a contract
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
through the division of Behavioral
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
Health under director
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
Fox um I did want to spend a little bit
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
of time um on some of our um engagement
 
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
rates and quit rates and vacancy rates
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital as you've
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
heard in other presentations we are
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
facing somewhat similar challenges as it
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
relates to agency utilization and
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
Staffing however I am really proud to
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
say that um the vacancy rate for
 
01:42:21.589 --> 01:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
full-time staff at New Hampshire
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
hospital is approximately 7 % if you
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
were to break that down to specifically
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
to nurses and mental health workers
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
which are vital team members in
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
providing patient care it is a little
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
higher however it remains in the low um
 
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
20s and I would say though that um our
 
01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:42.679 align:start position:0%
we have a really strong recruitment
 
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
initiative we have over 60 different
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
active initiatives to be able to recruit
 
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
staff um and approximately 64% of our
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
new hires in the last SE uh several
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
months have been through um referral of
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
our current staff members we also have a
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
really um great amount of staff who have
 
01:43:07.709 --> 01:43:07.719 align:start position:0%
as um comedon mentioned um retention we
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
have a really high retention rate at New
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital it's actually um a
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
little bit higher than the national
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
retention rate which we're really proud
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
of so we strive really hard at focusing
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
both on recruitment efforts as well as
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
um if comfortable with the committee I
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
can move to slide five which is some of
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospitals key
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishments I did want to mention
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
the high security unit um that build is
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
in progress we did break ground as you
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
know we have been on target with the
 
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
construction up until the end of this
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
past calendar year um the uh the
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
construction has most recently
 
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
experienced some delays as it relates
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
some to some foundational testing that
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
needs to occur however we do hope that
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
that will um be appropriate and we'll be
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
able to pick back up here in the coming
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
months um we do not anticipate needing
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
to fund the operating budget in this
 
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
next bium so um that's a that's a small
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
win um I would say we may need to back
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
into some staffing expenses at the end
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
of the bium to gear up for occupancy in
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
the following bium however um we have
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%
been doing taking advantage of this time
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
and doing a lot of operational planning
 
01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
for occupying that unit um and we think
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
that we will be very prepared at that
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
time to propose um you know the the
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
Staffing levels that we think would be
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate um I do want to also spend
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
some time I mentioned CTC um and the
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
cumulative efforts of mission zero as a
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
result of those efforts there has been a
 
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
43% reduction in emergency department
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
wait times for Pat patients who require
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
our level of care that's pretty
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
significant um in most recent months
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
we've been able to get that weight time
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
to under two days um and the average
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
weight list has dropped from numbers in
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
the 30s to numbers in single digits as
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
recently as February 2025 and there have
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
been several occasions where we've been
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
able to hit zero adults waiting in
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
emergency departments throughout the
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
state um and as A4 mentioned New
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital's full Capac capity
 
01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.149 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital's full Capac capity
is

01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
185 we recently hit that number there
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
has been a significant amount of effort
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
and focus on retaining uh returning New
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to our full capacity
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
um early in the last calendar year we
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
were approximately in the high 140s to
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
low 150s as census um we have been able
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
to achieve 185 and hope to be able to
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
maintain that um as you know a lot of
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
pressure to keep those beds uh online
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
and to uh have the appropriate Staffing
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
so um the next slide indicates some
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
additional data points as it relates to
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
this work um you can see on slide six uh
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
a drop in the average Q so that's the
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
number of patients who have been waiting
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
for a bed at New Hampshire hospital um
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
and you can see a slight increase in
 
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
summer months it's relatively common for
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
us um but overall a really great uh drop
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
in those
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
numbers and then slide seven um is the
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
last slide before Brett will jump into
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
some of the accounting unit information
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
um this is important context for you to
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
have in terms of continued support for
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
the mission zero efforts this slide
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
speaks to the importance of um folks
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
that are remaining at New Hampshire
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
hospital and some of the difficulties
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
we've faced in being able to trans
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
transition them into community- based
 
01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
settings um thank you for your
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement in that um in Prior
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
present ations as well um at any point
 
01:46:58.750 --> 01:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
in time between 2023 and um current
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
state we have approximately 90 to 100
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
individuals residing at New Hampshire
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
hospital hospital who would be eligible
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
to be discharged however due to various
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
reasons such as system capacity issues
 
01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
limitations um housing concerns across
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
the state various levels of housing
 
01:47:20.109 --> 01:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
availability um not just Independent
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
Living that um that is considerably
 
01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:25.639 align:start position:0%
difficult for us we have been able to
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
see some relief in that and have
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
partnered very closely um with other
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and been able to see that
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
drop in more recent months slightly you
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
can see that little dip uh there at the
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
end um but important to Just note that
 
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
to this Committee in terms of the work
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
that we need to continue to do um in the
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
importance of the mission zero efforts
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
may I may I ask you a question about
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
slide seven here
 
01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
sure okay so I think I heard you say
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
that that you can have a census of about
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
185 correct and this chart indicates
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
that you're often over a hundred of
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
people who could be
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
discharged so so that means you really
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
only have like 85 people or so that
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
ought to be in the New Hampshire
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
hospital the the rest of them are
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
treading water until we can find
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
someplace to discharge them
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
right is that is that a good summary of
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
this I think that that's a good summary
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
there is occasions of course that um
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
that population that 100 or so
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
population does EB and flow in terms of
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
their treatment needs but overall yes we
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
do have a significant portion of our
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
census who no longer needs that level of
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
care okay so I I know that this has been
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
talked about for a few years on on what
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
we need to do to open up capacity so you
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
can be discharging people could you just
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
give us a quick summary of what has been
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
tried to provide additional capacity for
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
you to discharge into and what has been
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
the holdup and having anything really
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
work I think it's I would say a number
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
of things have been tried I would say
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
that um as part of mission zero this is
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
sort of the phase of the project that we
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
are really moving into at this stage as
 
01:49:19.709 --> 01:49:19.719 align:start position:0%
well we had a lot of focus at the
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
beginning on um maintaining really front
 
01:49:25.149 --> 01:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
door initiatives and how we increase our
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
census at New Hampshire hospital and how
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
we make more beds available available
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
now we're really moving into more
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
backdoor focused efforts or what we
 
01:49:35.950 --> 01:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
refer to as the backdoor um so I think
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
more focus on this to come but I would
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
also say that as was afor mentioned by
 
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
Todd there has been efforts to
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
transition folks out of glencliffe into
 
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
more community- based settings we do
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
have Partnerships with um other
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities particularly
 
01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
straford County who has been very
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
supportive in transitioning folks out of
 
01:49:59.310 --> 01:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital into that level
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
of care um through efforts such as under
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
Mission zero such as the uh landlord
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
incentive that has been extremely
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
beneficial in supporting community-based
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
movement of individuals uh back into
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
community based settings so I would say
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
some of those things have worked I think
 
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
the work that we still have to do is
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
really understanding from a Statewide
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
perspective what resources we need um
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
and there has been Tools in place to try
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
to gather more of that information to
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
really understand you know out of that
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
100 20 need this level of care five need
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
this level of care and really be pretty
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
concise with that that's not information
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
that we've really had readily available
 
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
um to the degree that I think it's
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to make those informed
 
01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
decisions and be able to put forth
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
specific needs uh for
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
consideration represent tki thanks I'm
 
01:50:57.069 --> 01:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
equally as um concerned about this
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
number of patients waiting for discharge
 
01:51:00.589 --> 01:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if you can give
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
us an idea of the um length of stay of
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
patients and in particular this
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
community that once they receive a level
 
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
of treatment and they're in a good place
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
how long are they stuck waiting I would
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
say that it definitely varies um on the
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
highest and we do have a handful of
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
folks who have been at New Hampshire
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
hospital for over a year generally our
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
average length of stay is approximately
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
60 days that a little bit higher than 60
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
days that is skewed by this population
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
um the population who faces less
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
barriers in receiving their treatment
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
and returning to the community tends to
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
have a length of stay closer to 15 to 30
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
you so so what percentage of these folks
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
really need ongoing
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh in patient care but elsewhere versus
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
how many of them are ready to return to
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
the community with some community-based
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh counseling support I think it's a
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
great question that's some of the work
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
that we're doing now to try to
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
understand better however I would say
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
that a a high portion of these
 
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
individuals do continue to need a level
 
01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
of supportive care and not necessarily
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
in a long in a in a nursing home setting
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
we have seen some relief in the nursing
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
home settings to be able to accommodate
 
01:52:26.189 --> 01:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
patients but we don't want to be
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
obviously transitioning folks into those
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
settings who don't need that level of
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
care generally it's folks who um and
 
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
again we're we're working on this from a
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
more detailed perspective but generally
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's folks who need some type of
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
supported living whether it be a group
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
home or some type of transitional
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
setting that assists them with a lower
 
01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
level of Acuity treatment and helps be
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
supportive to them to return into the
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
community once they've uh reached those
 
01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.189 align:start position:0%
community once they've uh reached those
mileston

01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
mileston
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
stones but you don't have an idea of a
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
percentage between an inpatient and
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
outpatient breakdown I I don't I'd be
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take that back and try to do a
 
01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more of an analysis for you
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
um again I I probably would venture to
 
01:53:12.189 --> 01:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
say um over half to
 
01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:15.639 align:start position:0%
60% um would require some type of
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
supported living out of this 100 but but
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry supportive living in an
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
inpatient or an outpatient outpatient so
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
it would probably look well it depends
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
on what you would consider a group home
 
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
to be I I consider that a community
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
based setting an outpatient setting as
 
01:53:34.510 --> 01:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to an acute inpatient setting so
 
01:53:37.470 --> 01:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
um a group home um environment would
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
support a additional level of care but
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
obviously not you know a 247 nursing
 
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
model yeah if we if we're providing the
 
01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:47.719 align:start position:0%
shelter I I think of that as an
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
inpatient you know it's it's a it's a
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
step down certainly as a step step down
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
big step down but it it it's it still
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
seems if we're providing shelter uh it's
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
become a form of uh impatient but
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative so I guess when you come
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
back with some more information uh I
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're going to be able to
 
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
get to that in the budget cycle if it's
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
going to make our decision but I think
 
01:54:16.589 --> 01:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
long run I we need to understand better
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
what the needs of this group are because
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
that helps us figure out you know what
 
01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
priority we put on Solutions so uh
 
01:54:25.159 --> 01:54:27.189 align:start position:0%
priority we put on Solutions so uh
representative

01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for everything you do I really
 
01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
um with your zero mission is do they do
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
you have a mandate of how many days you
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
need to to keep the patients there
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
before you release them to hopefully a
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
community base uh
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
facility or is that just depending upon
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
um the level of treatment that's
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
required for each of the patients the
 
01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
lad um we OB so the latter in that it's
 
01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:07.719 align:start position:0%
really dependent um per specific patient
 
01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
we do have patients who are there under
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
Court ORD so of course we have to comply
 
01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%
with the parameters therein if we feel
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
that they need a a longer length of stay
 
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond that court order then
 
01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
we're obligated to go back to the court
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
to justify that um but it's very patient
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
dependent and um I would assume um most
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
of this is Medicaid um funded okay and
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
and they have no you have to release
 
01:55:40.750 --> 01:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
these patients in 20 days or else kind
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
of mandates that we're finding in
 
01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
private hospitals we're not getting that
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
kind of a mandate however we're
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
typically getting authorizations for 15
 
01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
to 17 days so that's the amount of days
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
we get paid for but the patients will
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
stay with us could you speak closer to
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
the mic the people at home need to get
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
you closer to the mic how is this better
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
all right uh so typically um Medicaid
 
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
and other payers will give us an
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
authorization that's a certain number of
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
days so those are the days 15 and 17
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
days usually the general range yeah um
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
and they'll pay for okay they'll pay for
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
those but we're not going to we're not
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
going to send a patient out until we
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
have an appropriate place to put them
 
01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
Wallner can you tell me what your um
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
daily rate is sure our current daily
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
$1,599 okay a follow-up question um of
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
all of the of the close to a 100 people
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
who are waiting at New Hampshire
 
01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
hospital but could transition to some a
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
different type of care would that care
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
be less
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
expensive it generally would be um I'm I
 
01:57:04.069 --> 01:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
don't recall the per Dum at Glen Cliff
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
but as an example it's less than half of
 
01:57:06.639 --> 01:57:09.709 align:start position:0%
but as an example it's less than half of
our

01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
rate okay I was wondering about even
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
though it's not in your depart not in
 
01:57:18.669 --> 01:57:18.679 align:start position:0%
your department anymore but the path
 
01:57:20.669 --> 01:57:20.679 align:start position:0%
program which you developed a couple of
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
years ago um
 
01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
how what was the daily rate there when
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
you were able to transition people out
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't recall
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
the daily rate there but it was less
 
01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:32.470 align:start position:0%
the daily rate there but it was less
than

01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so certainly less expensive than
 
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Stringham so just to
 
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
reemphasize you know looking at your
 
01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
discharge more than half of the the
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
patients there are essentially being
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
warehoused until
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
um until we find a more appropriate less
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
expensive setting of care but as of
 
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
right now we're incurring the cost um uh
 
01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
at a much higher at this higher level
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
roughly $1,500 a day um you know waiting
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
waiting for those things to show
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
up yes I mean they are receiving a uh a
 
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
level of treatment and support but not
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily um at the lever level that
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
is required to have them remain at New
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
 
01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.189 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
thank

01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
you go ahead all right so moving on to
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
slide number eight and I I'd like to
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
just start with the the two accounting
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
units that are not on here because
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
they're they're not being funded so we
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
just talked about path which was
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
6096 um we took all of the funding out
 
01:58:42.669 --> 01:58:42.679 align:start position:0%
of it at the beginning of this fiscal
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
year because we transitioned that
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
program to NFI North so we don't have
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
any uh budget requests for that one
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
additionally the high security unit is
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 3171 and we have no
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
funding in that accounting unit as
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
well um so accounting unit
 
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
8400 which starts on page one25 excuse
 
01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:06.669 align:start position:0%
8400 which starts on page one25 excuse
me

01:59:06.669 --> 01:59:06.679 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:09.800 align:start position:0%

8410 which is on page 102
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
and it includes our facility food and
 
01:59:27.870 --> 01:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
nutrition supply chain Environmental
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
Services accounting unit 8750 is where
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
the bulk of our clinical staff are
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
nurses mental health workers social
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
workers it's also the accounting unit
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
that we use to pay the contract for
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock for our physicians
 
01:59:42.189 --> 01:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
and other
 
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
providers on on um on
 
01:59:47.709 --> 01:59:47.719 align:start position:0%
Administration do do we do we have any
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
lingering big bills still to upgrade
 
01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:53.350 align:start position:0%
lingering big bills still to upgrade
facility

01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
security I know I know the the the foyer
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
has been completely paid for and
 
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
renovated at least I think that's true
 
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
do throughout the facility are there
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
other safety requirements that we're
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
aware of that are in this budget uh no
 
02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
not at this point in time I mean we do
 
02:00:15.149 --> 02:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
have some fire safety work ahead of us
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
the foyer Lobby renovation actually is
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to be starting in the next uh 30
 
02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
days um but in terms of of funding um no
 
02:00:27.629 --> 02:00:27.639 align:start position:0%
major asks at this stage and we do have
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
um units in need of renovation but are
 
02:00:31.629 --> 02:00:31.639 align:start position:0%
not in a place or desire to take beds
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
offline to do so um so perhaps at a
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
future State thank you and while it's
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
not a project uh we uh a result of the
 
02:00:42.030 --> 02:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
findings from our um November
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
2023 um issue was that we needed uh more
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
on-site security so we have we're
 
02:00:50.109 --> 02:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
working on Contracting with a security
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
firm and that's included our say that
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
phrase again for Onsite what what did
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
you just say what's the What's the
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
phrase you use for Onsite onsite
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
security oh you need on-site security so
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
you of all the employees that you
 
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
currently have none of them are
 
02:01:10.350 --> 02:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
specialized in security duties right so
 
02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
currently we contract with the
 
02:01:14.430 --> 02:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and we have S so
 
02:01:16.069 --> 02:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
police that are
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
are security for the entire campus the
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
seate office complex so so you imagine
 
02:01:25.069 --> 02:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
having to beef up that security
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
relationship right and is that in the
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
budget yes yes oh okay all
 
02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:35.430 align:start position:0%
budget yes yes oh okay all
right

02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
okay right so on slide number nine I
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
have our vacancy rates that go across
 
02:01:42.069 --> 02:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
our accounting units and I have them
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
Broken Out by full-time and
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
part-time um as Ellen noted we're at
 
02:01:51.069 --> 02:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
around 15 to 17% vacancy rate for our
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
full-time position right now which is a
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
significant decrease from even just
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
23% slide number 10 I just have listed a
 
02:02:07.709 --> 02:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
couple of our more expensive uh it
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
system so obviously our electronic uh
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
medical record which is is called Avatar
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
we have our pixus medication dispensing
 
02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
system which our Pharmacy uses to make
 
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
sure our patients get the right doses at
 
02:02:20.669 --> 02:02:20.679 align:start position:0%
the right time and then the inovalon
 
02:02:22.270 --> 02:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
electronic claims management systems
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
helps us uh bill I I may be getting you
 
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
confused with a a historical fo footnote
 
02:02:32.109 --> 02:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
from Hamstead but it wasn't that long
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
ago that did how long have you had an
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record system years
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
yes oh okay so it's Hamstead that didn't
 
02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.069 --> 02:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
yes all right and then our last slide we
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
just talk a bit more about the high
 
02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
security units so in our agency budget
 
02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
we had had anticipated that perhaps we
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
would be able to um fully staff the
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
facility in fiscal year 27 we've had a
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
few delays in the construction and we
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
expect the building to be completed in
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 27 um but we don't have a a
 
02:03:06.510 --> 02:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
great date at this time as to when it
 
02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
will be completed um so the ask really
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be for the sfy 26 that are in here
 
02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
to be available in 27 really for basic
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
building maintenance items um for once
 
02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
the facility is constructed and vacated
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
by the construction company so so again
 
02:03:24.629 --> 02:03:24.639 align:start position:0%
I need to get you closer to the
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
microphone I'm cuz it's really me that's
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
deaf I was just blaming it on the people
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
at home but uh so so what happens if you
 
02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
don't get this what how how do you work
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
around your security
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
requirement we don't really have a
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
security requirement for this facility
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
in this bium because we're not
 
02:03:48.750 --> 02:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating having it open to patients
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
in this by this coming by anym yeah uh
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
the only expense that we do anticipate
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
incurring are basic utilities expenses
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
things that you have to just keep up for
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
a vacant building right I I I I think
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about page 11 are you yes
 
02:04:05.549 --> 02:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
the high security unit yes so I I think
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
that the the dollars that are in there
 
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 27 we can remove those
 
02:04:11.709 --> 02:04:11.719 align:start position:0%
and the amounts that are in there for
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 we would like to move to
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal 27 okay those are just for basic
 
02:04:19.390 --> 02:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
utilities thanks thank you uh
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth did you have
 
02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
have a question could you also refer to
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
where this what the page and the
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
governor's budget it's not in the
 
02:04:32.669 --> 02:04:32.679 align:start position:0%
governor's budget it's not in there at
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
all is so where would it go if you you
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
requested we put it in where would we be
 
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
putting it so the accounting unit exists
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's accounting unit 3171 3171 and it it
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
was part of our agency request um but
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
then not funded by the
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
governor is that and and maybe does that
 
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit exist somewhere in this
 
02:04:59.549 --> 02:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
that so the BEC because there's no
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
history there because it's brand new um
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that that won't print to
 
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
show a record because otherwise it would
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
just show 0000000000 across everything
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
there and and I think that's the reason
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
why you're not seeing it there but as as
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
Brett indicated it it does exist um we
 
02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
just don't have money in the next panium
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
for it thank you representative
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
Stringham so on page 1038 you have
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
699 uh uh positions of which 686 are
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
permanent uh are any of those position
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
now unfunded in the final
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
budget yes uh we have 109 full-time
 
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
positions that are unfunded in the
 
02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:45.310 align:start position:0%
positions that are unfunded in the
governor's

02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
budget so uh how will you operate
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
without being able to go out and add
 
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
advertise and promote for those
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
positions um we at New Hampshire
 
02:05:59.390 --> 02:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
hospital we are utilizing agency staff
 
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
however it always is our main goal um to
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
have state staff um working very closely
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
with the department and leadership in
 
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
terms of prioritizing our Direct Care
 
02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
needs to maintain operations we do feel
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
with our current level of Staffing and
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
the utilization of the agency Staffing
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we will be able to maintain census
 
02:06:24.750 --> 02:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
um in terms of positions turning over we
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
feel like there is a good plan in place
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to rehire to fill those
 
02:06:32.669 --> 02:06:32.679 align:start position:0%
vacant positions um however as has been
 
02:06:36.549 --> 02:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
afar mentioned um it will be challenging
 
02:06:39.629 --> 02:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh how we prioritize
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
positions and how we fill them going
 
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
forward is there enough budget in the
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
agency Staffing lines where that fits in
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
to fill um the request given given that
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to have uh um less number
 
02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:55.350 align:start position:0%
you're going to have uh um less number
of

02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
positions the amount of agency Staffing
 
02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
in the budget is more or less continuing
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
our current levels which the governor's
 
02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
our current levels which the governor's
budget

02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
is more or less at our current vacancy
 
02:07:14.669 --> 02:07:14.679 align:start position:0%
rate it matches what we're currently at
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay so your your current budget calls
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
for um about 20 million more in total if
 
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm again on page 1038
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
Mone on page 1038 um uh about about 20%
 
02:07:33.549 --> 02:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
higher than actuals in
 
02:07:39.229 --> 02:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
2024 uh about 118 million in 26 and 121
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year
 
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
2027 where would you say those main
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
increases are coming from they're almost
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
entirely from Personnel thank you
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative n Al yeah thank you uh
 
02:07:55.709 --> 02:07:55.719 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards I quick question it's
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
probably because I'm a little slow and
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
new at this on page 11 are there headers
 
02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
missing there on above those numbers or
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I I suppose we should have
 
02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
put FY 26 and 27 on the left side on 26
 
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
27 okay thank
 
02:08:18.189 --> 02:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
walner so where where do I find in where
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
do I find the agency staff that
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
you keep what lines in the budget agency
 
02:08:30.430 --> 02:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
staff would be in accounting unit
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
8750 and
 
02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:35.069 align:start position:0%
8750 and
in

02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:35.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:08:38.589 --> 02:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
102 contracts for program
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
Services that's page one
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
Z and just a a note in the fy2 adjusted
 
02:08:51.549 --> 02:08:51.559 align:start position:0%
off it says 16.5 million um there's 's
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
an error in the calculation there it's
 
02:08:55.069 --> 02:08:55.079 align:start position:0%
actually a little over 20 million
 
02:08:56.910 --> 02:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
because that number does not include our
 
02:09:00.669 --> 02:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
contract it's corrected in the S
 
02:09:08.589 --> 02:09:08.599 align:start position:0%
SOA oh it's line 102
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
you all right I I don't see any other
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
questions and you look like you're at
 
02:09:19.709 --> 02:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
the end do do you have a wrap
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
up no other than to say thank you for
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
your time sure um well thank you uh Mr
 
02:09:31.149 --> 02:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
White or Dr Hannah are you coming up too
 
02:09:34.549 --> 02:09:34.559 align:start position:0%
no um I I think I I remember the
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
punchline on this we contracted Hamstead
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
Hospital over to Dartmouth and that gets
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
us out of the cost accounting business
 
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's why you zeroed out our
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.510 --> 02:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
or is that completely wholly independent
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
and and no longer having any requirement
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
for us to have visibility we've
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
contracted we're getting some money what
 
02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
what what are we doing there sure
 
02:10:13.229 --> 02:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
so I is it okay if I just give a little
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
bit of the history just for everyone's
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
awareness just because it is a it's it's
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a several years story it's
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
like the fourth major return in the in
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
the in the path so yes it might be so uh
 
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh on June 8th 2022 the state purchased
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital from Hamstead Outlook
 
02:10:35.709 --> 02:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
LLC um at that time the department
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
initially entered into a soul Source
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
contract um with a provider where
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
whereby they provided most all the
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
clinical staff the Physicians uh social
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
workers and the state established
 
02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
administrative support rool relative to
 
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
finance as well as key executive
 
02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
leadership positions um after 2 years uh
 
02:11:02.669 --> 02:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
the state transitioned um into a
 
02:11:04.549 --> 02:11:04.559 align:start position:0%
contract with with Dartmouth Mary
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Memorial Hospital whereby they
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
were providing primarily The Physician
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
level positions and then the state
 
02:11:16.229 --> 02:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
transferred a little over 165 positions
 
02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
to the state um that that transpired in
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh June 30th of
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
2025 4 four 2024 thank you Marissa sorry
 
02:11:34.030 --> 02:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
time flies um of 2024 and in December on
 
02:11:36.189 --> 02:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
December 18th the governor executive
 
02:11:40.350 --> 02:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
Council approved a a package of
 
02:11:43.149 --> 02:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
contracts whereby the department entered
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
into a lease agreement with Mary
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Memorial Hospital whereby Mary
 
02:11:50.549 --> 02:11:50.559 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Memorial Hospital would run
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
and operate
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
the facility there were a couple other
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
agreements as well there was a joint
 
02:11:57.310 --> 02:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
operating committee agreement that
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
allows the department to continue to
 
02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.390 align:start position:0%
allows the department to continue to
have

02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
um essentially Sway and and um Authority
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
as dictated by the agreement relative to
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
the oversight and strategic direction of
 
02:12:14.109 --> 02:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
the activity of the hospitals there was
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
also a purchase acquisition uh that
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
provided I think about
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
$600,000 um for the whereby we sold uh
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
some of the uh equipment the furniture
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
that was on site at the hospital and
 
02:12:30.669 --> 02:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
then there was also transition Services
 
02:12:35.069 --> 02:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
agreement where we would continue to uh
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
to to continue State contracts to
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
support Dartmouth Hitchcock and they
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
agreed to pay us an administrative fee
 
02:12:43.069 --> 02:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
while they transition with that
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
ownership and the ownership officially
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
took place on February 3rd that
 
02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
transition Services agreement continues
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh for up up to a year but you know
 
02:12:54.669 --> 02:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
we're work we're working with uh Mary
 
02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock on a daily basis to make those
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
determinations and roll them off so if
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
1,62 of the governor's operating
 
02:13:12.430 --> 02:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
budget you will see that Hamstead
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital operations has been zeroed out
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal years 26 and
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
27 what we were looking at annually um
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
based on some of the historical trends
 
02:13:24.549 --> 02:13:24.559 align:start position:0%
that we were seeing with the revenue
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
that we were bringing in was the
 
02:13:28.990 --> 02:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
potential need for up to $20 million of
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
General funds each year um because the
 
02:13:35.549 --> 02:13:35.559 align:start position:0%
state no longer has positions there and
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
we no longer have um any any direct
 
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
expenses as Mary Hitchcock is now
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
Leasing and operating the facility um
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's no need for a budget here the
 
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
original lease agreement that I did
 
02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
mention earlier that does provide for
 
02:13:54.549 --> 02:13:54.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue to come to the
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
state however um there there is a
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
provision within that lease agreement
 
02:14:03.549 --> 02:14:03.559 align:start position:0%
that specifies and and this is unique
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
I've I I've never seen an agreement
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
quite like this so we were looking for a
 
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
unique solution and the key provision
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
there is that the state is responsible
 
02:14:15.310 --> 02:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
for up to $3 million of capital
 
02:14:19.229 --> 02:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
Investments but th those dollars M there
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
must be a match on the part of Mary
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
hitch Co so if they spend a dollar the
 
02:14:25.549 --> 02:14:25.559 align:start position:0%
state spends a dollar up to $3 million
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
so it's it's basically a
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
50/50 uh agreement whereby we will
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
concurrently invest money into that um
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
there is currently Senate Bill
 
02:14:42.430 --> 02:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
118 that establishes a a Hamstead
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital Residential Treatment Facility
 
02:14:47.549 --> 02:14:47.559 align:start position:0%
capital investment fund and the way that
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
that bill currently reads is that the
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
lease Revenue which which which is
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
approximately $1.3 million each year
 
02:14:58.189 --> 02:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
will be deposited for the next biennium
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
into that accounting unit so that we
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
have that those dollars available and
 
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
ready to go and it's up to a maximum
 
02:15:08.669 --> 02:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
amount of 3 million so we won't see the
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
the tenative uh plan or hope is that we
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
won't necessarily see that Revenue in
 
02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
our budget this year because we need to
 
02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have those dollars
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
immediately available and If and and if
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're not appr orated to us then we
 
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
may not be able to meet the terms of the
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
lease again it's it's a fairly unique
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
agreement the Attorney General's office
 
02:15:31.629 --> 02:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
was involved in that um and Advising and
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
Advising us there but what we will see
 
02:15:38.350 --> 02:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
in the bium um the subsequent banum is
 
02:15:41.629 --> 02:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
we will probably see about $2.6 million
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
in total revenue um over the over the
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
entire bayum going forward and the lease
 
02:15:51.069 --> 02:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
agreement is good for seven years seven
 
02:15:54.669 --> 02:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
years with the option to renew uh for a
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
total of up to 20 years in in totality
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
so in the long run from a purely
 
02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:01.750 align:start position:0%
so in the long run from a purely
Financial

02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
perspective we we will see a net benefit
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the state in lie of the potential $20
 
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
million of General funds that we were
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
looking at for the next bium each
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
year but that it sounded like you said
 
02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
the net Financial
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
benefit is that it would get plowed back
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
in into an account reserved for Capital
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
Improvements that we're obligated to
 
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
perform so so that little side account
 
02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
is adds nothing to the the state's
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
ability other than to meet Our
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
obligation that money doesn't go
 
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere else yes and and that that
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
would be temporary um that that would
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
not be long run the the intent there is
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we meet that we have
 
02:16:48.990 --> 02:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
money available for that $3 million
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
obligation and once that SA ified then
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
in future years that Revenue would be
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
available to the state and and where
 
02:16:57.549 --> 02:16:57.559 align:start position:0%
would that Revenue go would that be just
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
into the general treasury would that go
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
into like an a Commissioner's Office
 
02:17:04.389 --> 02:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
account have you thought that far down
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I've thought about it but I don't
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
necessarily think at this point in time
 
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
we've made a final decision as to where
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
we want to budget that I'm assuming
 
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
probably somewhere in the office of the
 
02:17:14.190 --> 02:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner may be appropriate so
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's clear transparency around those
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
those dollars sure I'm I'm looking at
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
1063 are there still positions listed
 
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
there that shouldn't be down at the
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
bottom for Hamstead yes so today those
 
02:17:30.429 --> 02:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
positions still technically exist um
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're not funded currently
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
though okay out of the Hamstead budget
 
02:17:40.270 --> 02:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
okay so so the way I I was used to
 
02:17:43.629 --> 02:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
Manpower accounting was these these are
 
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
like units of resource and you could
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
pick them up out of these accounts and
 
02:17:49.709 --> 02:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
move them into other accounts if you
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to does the state let you do that
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
is that part of the state process that
 
02:17:58.270 --> 02:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
was part of the federal process um So
 
02:17:59.950 --> 02:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
currently they still show up in our
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
total FTE count yeah um and during the
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
transition uh when when Dartmouth was uh
 
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
when we were working with them to to
 
02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
finalize the deal um the individuals
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
that were that were in those filled
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
positions we had we gave them the
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to transfer to another
 
02:18:21.150 --> 02:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
location within the department a number
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
of them transferred more of them uh
 
02:18:25.469 --> 02:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
moved over to the employee of Mary
 
02:18:28.270 --> 02:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock sure so that's a faces versus
 
02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
places thing the faces moved to a
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
different employer but we kept the
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
spaces yes okay um all right so so my my
 
02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
concern here now is uh talk us through
 
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:42.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to keep this short because
 
02:18:44.589 --> 02:18:44.599 align:start position:0%
I realize we're into our lunch but if we
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
finish this then we can break for the
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
day so I'm driving on a little bit
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
longer um
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
the vision at one point uh was that
 
02:18:58.750 --> 02:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital and the new YDC would
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
have a symbiotic relationship to the
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
point where they could share resources
 
02:19:06.750 --> 02:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
back and forth the their the logistics
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
Services plus there are Manpower
 
02:19:11.950 --> 02:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
services that were going to become
 
02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
sharable would does this new contract
 
02:19:18.669 --> 02:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
completely change that
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
Vision I think the vision remains the
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
same the way since we don't have all of
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
the shared services fully fleshed out
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
yet um Dartmouth Health expressed full
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
willingness and there's a there's a um
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
sentence in the lease I don't have it in
 
02:19:34.830 --> 02:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
front of me that commits them to uh
 
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
working in good faith but we imp
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
particular focused on the um culinary
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
Services since we aren't building a
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
kitchen at the new YDC so that was
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
stated explicitly but other shared
 
02:19:47.230 --> 02:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
services be it you know nighttime
 
02:19:50.710 --> 02:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
nursing or education or whatnot were um
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
were left open with a good faith
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
commitment to working those in as
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
contract amendments later so we're going
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
to be moving food three times a day or
 
02:20:00.750 --> 02:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
something maybe four times for a
 
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
midnight feeding so do we have a Cuisine
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
Corridor your former culture Corridor is
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
now the cuisine keep renaming it till we
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
fund it yeah I mean I think that's those
 
02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
are the conversations that we're having
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
right now I think as you know additional
 
02:20:20.349 --> 02:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
arpa funds were um that didn't uh move
 
02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
forward with the solution Health build
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
and londonerry were reallocated um in
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
part towards several of the ad
 
02:20:29.429 --> 02:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
alternates and so we're now working with
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
our construction and architect firm
 
02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
through DPW as well as with the
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office to sort those out and
 
02:20:36.510 --> 02:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have the right
 
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
selections um realizing we have a lot of
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
desires including space for the kids to
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
play Outdoors safely and um you know the
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
the proper interior features but
 
02:20:50.190 --> 02:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
needless to say your advocacy for the
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
culture culinary Corridor remains a
 
02:20:54.990 --> 02:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
priority for us as well okay so so I'm
 
02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to keep hope alive yes okay okay
 
02:21:00.910 --> 02:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
very good are are there are there
 
02:21:04.270 --> 02:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
questions here representa elvano yeah
 
02:21:06.990 --> 02:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh Mr White I a quick
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
question on the lease agreement we U we
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's multiple years and extend
 
02:21:14.590 --> 02:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
extendable I'm assuming that there's
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
some escalation in the I mean we you
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
were quoting a fixed number but I'm
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
assuming they escalation causes in there
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
that would cause that that number to
 
02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
increase over time the the the rent
 
02:21:29.469 --> 02:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
amount yes yes it it does increase uh by
 
02:21:32.190 --> 02:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
several percentage Points each year
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
yep okay so so when you're you're
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the you know 1.3 per year
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the 2.7 that would actually be a
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
bigger number uh slightly I was rounding
 
02:21:45.070 --> 02:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
so the first Year's less than 1.3
 
02:21:47.469 --> 02:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
million but but it it it it would be
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
slightly more over time okay thank you
 
02:21:54.190 --> 02:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any more questions at
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
this point um do you have
 
02:21:59.550 --> 02:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
any additional words of thought on this
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
subject or anything you've heard is no I
 
02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
just think it's going well and we're
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
glad to be able to at a in a tough
 
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue time um to be able to provide
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
excellent service at the Quality we
 
02:22:12.990 --> 02:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
expect without it being um an additional
 
02:22:17.230 --> 02:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
um expense for the state so so I think
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
if I summarize everything I've heard
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
today the the the biggest thing I'm
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about is um making sure that
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
we have adequate Staffing levels at
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
glencliffe to keep their census at a
 
02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
particular level and keep them able to
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
stay in the game for being a discharge
 
02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
location for the New Hampshire
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
hospital um that that that was my
 
02:22:45.070 --> 02:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
takeaway what what what how do you react
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
to that is that a legitimate concern or
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
or sure yeah I I I mean I think
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
when we think about the Department of
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services budget we have
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
very unique and very complex and very
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
diverse uh array of business so if we're
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
talking about Medicaid there's $1.3
 
02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
billion for the Medicaid Program but the
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
actual division has 34 people in it
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
versus if we look at New Hampshire
 
02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
hospital in glencliffe which is almost
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
exclusively not exclusively but a very
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
high percentage is Personnel so person
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
are are critical for the operations
 
02:23:24.750 --> 02:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
there and then because of the way that
 
02:23:27.070 --> 02:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
we have budgeted at Glen Cliffe with the
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
goal of hiring those positions we we
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
have always used those vacancy dollars
 
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
to fund the agency staff to fill the
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
gaps um so it again it's it it's a
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
challenge um that we we certainly
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
recognize and we appreciate the
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration looking at
 
02:23:47.710 --> 02:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
that okay so represent Stringham so um
 
02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know we talked about the Glen
 
02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
Cliff situation and um it's kind of uh
 
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
maybe peeled back uh a little bit what's
 
02:23:58.590 --> 02:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
going on and you just mentioned now um
 
02:24:01.950 --> 02:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh the practice of using unfilled
 
02:24:05.389 --> 02:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
positions to fill funding gaps that
 
02:24:08.429 --> 02:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
emerge during the incredibly complex
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
period of time of the two-year budget
 
02:24:16.870 --> 02:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
cycle uh as you go on how much um other
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
areas will you do you see in at M
 
02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps in adequate buffer to fill
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
temporary position funding gaps or other
 
02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
things uh that you know may may not be
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
as obvious as the Glen Cliffe one is to
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
us so what what we've tried to what
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
we've tried to do in in this budget is
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
when we look at our department-wide
 
02:24:44.429 --> 02:24:44.439 align:start position:0%
transfers that's the point at which we
 
02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
essentially identify the gap between
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
what we budgeted and what you know what
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
the plan was and what what happened and
 
02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
so if you think back to some of the
 
02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
early presentations where we had the
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
little bubbles where it's like here's
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
your budget here's your actual here's
 
02:24:58.030 --> 02:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
your cost allocation you know that's the
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
actual experience so we've tried to
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
address those areas um yesterday we
 
02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
talked about dtss where we saw Nursing
 
02:25:08.349 --> 02:25:08.359 align:start position:0%
Facility expenses um exceed the budgeted
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
amounts and we've tried to account for
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
that within the budget um during DCF you
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
know we we looked at what are the res
 
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
costs that we're seeing and we put a PN
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
and that was partially funded so far so
 
02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
we tried to account for that looking at
 
02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
the syc budget um you know that was
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
based on a closing budget for the
 
02:25:28.670 --> 02:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
current bium so that was well below and
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
we had to move $3.5 Million last year
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
for that so we've tried to um actively
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
identify those other gap areas and and
 
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
and address those through the agency
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
budget um to
 
02:25:44.349 --> 02:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
date okay thank you uh kind of my other
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
comment uh Mr Speaker is that um not yet
 
02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
not yet not a speaker
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman Mr chairman uh is that um
 
02:25:58.429 --> 02:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
you know I I think I think the
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
presentations we've heard today I think
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to make our systems more
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
efficient is to rely more on labor and
 
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
less on contract workers and uh both
 
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliffe and New Hampshire hospital
 
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
by removing um and unfund positions that
 
02:26:19.309 --> 02:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
they would need to move in that
 
02:26:22.349 --> 02:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
direction will be uh uh virtually
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
impossible for them so um what what
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
we'll do is uh in Glen Cliff's case
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
without changes will probably send it
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
into a death spiral in New Hampshire
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals I think will will put make it
 
02:26:39.389 --> 02:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
more of um you know less efficient uh
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
and less movement away from contract
 
02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
workers uh towards um towards uh
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
full-time staff uh you know that would
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
lead to a better bottom line greater
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
service for our for our for those in
 
02:26:56.429 --> 02:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
needs so I would say that's a brilliant
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
observation and that probably everyone
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's looked at government level
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
recruiting of Health Care
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce agrees with you I think the
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
problem with counties with the state is
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
that uh since co co exacerbated it and
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
where we had to rely on uh on prum's
 
02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:22.710 align:start position:0%
where we had to rely on uh on prum's
attempt

02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
nursing and we just haven't figured out
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
how to get back to preco labor levels
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
and and my sense is that um that the
 
02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
state can do something about it but that
 
02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
the solutions are going to have to be
 
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
largely local the workforce challenges
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
at glencliffe are different than the
 
02:27:46.429 --> 02:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
workforce challenges at New Hampshire
 
02:27:49.389 --> 02:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
hospital and so each of those leadership
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
teams may end up with their own solution
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
to move us from um relying so much on
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
contracts to be able to rely
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
increasingly on our own employees and
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
and I I don't I'm not smart enough to
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
know what each of those should do I am
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
receptive enough to hear concrete
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
proposals uh and to see what we might be
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
able to do to to support a local
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
initiative and I appreciate appreciate
 
02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
that and I think that's the right
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
direction uh is the budget as structured
 
02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
may not give them enough flexibility to
 
02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
do that and perhaps without dramatically
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
changing the budget up or down in either
 
02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
way we can do that in this
 
02:28:40.110 --> 02:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
process okay and and again I I I don't
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
feel competent to change the budget in
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
the absence of a local proposal to say
 
02:28:49.710 --> 02:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
this is what we would do and this is how
 
02:28:52.030 --> 02:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
we would do it and this is the impact on
 
02:28:53.710 --> 02:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
why the budget should look a little
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
different I I think I think I would I
 
02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
need to see a local proposal before I
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
have any clue its impact on how we've
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
how they've spent a year putting the
 
02:29:05.399 --> 02:29:08.309 align:start position:0%
how they've spent a year putting the
budget

02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
together representative priest uh thank
 
02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and and this question is
 
02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
directly to you Nate and to um the
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
deputy and to too
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
um could we also look into whether or
 
02:29:28.750 --> 02:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
not we can have a statutory language
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
request like the
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
veterans um department is requesting for
 
02:29:38.429 --> 02:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
other departments who are facing nursing
 
02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
challenges and have in statute that the
 
02:29:46.590 --> 02:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
state will do a college tuition
 
02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
forgiveness for a length of stage year
 
02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
years at that
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:59.070 --> 02:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
division 5 years 10 years I don't know
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
but you know make it so that we can
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
attract nurses they can get their
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
tuition paid
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
for and um work in these
 
02:30:11.870 --> 02:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
facilities I I don't know if it's
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
possible but I wanted to throw it out so
 
02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
so just to do a slightly modified
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
version of what you just asked for I
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
I I I I would like to see something like
 
02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
that as well I would refer to it as a a
 
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
local plan and I wouldn't want to tie
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
their hands by saying the solution shall
 
02:30:34.510 --> 02:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
include a student loan rep playment
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
repayment program I think I think the
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
other day we laid out a couple of
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
different alternatives on how to do that
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
we could do a a relocation reimbursement
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh we could do something to um uh
 
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
support spous employment I I and while
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
the loan rep payment program may be part
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
of a solution I just don't want to make
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
it sound like that's the only solution
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
to our Workforce problems I want people
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
broadly chairman Edwards um there is
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
currently a statute that exists it's RSA
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
943 uh bi- a and it it allows New
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hosital hospital and Glen
 
02:31:22.349 --> 02:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
Cliff home to establish Recruitment and
 
02:31:24.510 --> 02:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
Retention programs yes sir one of the
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
challenges there is that a you need to
 
02:31:29.590 --> 02:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
have money for it B in order to get that
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
approved we need approval from the
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
02:31:35.309 --> 02:31:35.319 align:start position:0%
The Joint op uh The Joint Committee on
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
employee classification and compensation
 
02:31:40.190 --> 02:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
as well as the governor and executive
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
counsel um so from a from a dynamic
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
perspective there's certainly a long
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
line of approvals that we have to go
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
through and it could fail at any point
 
02:31:50.349 --> 02:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
in time and then the second that of
 
02:31:52.190 --> 02:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
course is funding and it's difficult I
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
think it's difficult to justify a
 
02:31:55.389 --> 02:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
retention program when you don't
 
02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily um have staff and that's
 
02:31:59.230 --> 02:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
obviously a balance and that's a
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
strategic judgment call but but those
 
02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
are just some of the challenges but
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
there is something that does exist
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
today it doesn't sound very
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
Nimble it is not Nimble not
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
Nimble um all right um final words of
 
02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
wisdom any more questions from the
 
02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:20.870 align:start position:0%
wisdom any more questions from the
committee

02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:32:23.070 --> 02:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone in the audience that
 
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
had come here wanting to speak Miss
 
02:32:27.269 --> 02:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg that would like an opportunity
 
02:32:30.670 --> 02:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
to speak okay come on up is there anyone
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
anticipating now remember we started
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
lunch at
 
02:32:43.870 --> 02:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
noon I know I'm I'm starving too yeah so
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the policy
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
director at the disability rights Center
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for indulging me during
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
your LUN Lun hour but I'm hoping you're
 
02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
going to get to leave after you're done
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
here and eat um so the reason I wanted
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
to raise a make a few comments here is
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
that um there was a reference to the
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health agreement and so
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
as you may know my office brought the
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
lawsuit along with others representing a
 
02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
class of individuals who had been um
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
warehoused at places like New Hampshire
 
02:33:14.590 --> 02:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
hospital and glencliffe and I think we
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
brought the lawsuit in around 2010 going
 
02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
I guess and eventually um after the
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
federal district court certified a class
 
02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
um the parties were able to settle um
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit um actually by that time the
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
US Department of Justice had also
 
02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
intervened in the case and so we ended
 
02:33:35.950 --> 02:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
up with what were all what we all call
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
the CMHA or Community Mental Health
 
02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
agreement and I believe that was entered
 
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
in around
 
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
2014 and the expectation the the purpose
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
of the lawsuit was to address this the
 
02:33:51.269 --> 02:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
warehousing of people it was right the
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
agreement was in I believe February of
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
2014 um and the expectation at that time
 
02:34:00.590 --> 02:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
was that um there would be a b a lot of
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
different services and interventions put
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
into place that would re reduce the
 
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
Reliance on institutional settings there
 
02:34:10.510 --> 02:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
was nothing in the agreement that um
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
specified like number of beds or any
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
that you know that would be available at
 
02:34:17.269 --> 02:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
these institutions instead the agreement
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
established some programs that um the
 
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
state had already started investing in
 
02:34:26.110 --> 02:34:26.120 align:start position:0%
like mobile crisis and also um required
 
02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
um an investment in services like a sort
 
02:34:32.190 --> 02:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
of community treatment known as act um
 
02:34:34.349 --> 02:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
supported housing supported employment
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
and there were some Provisions around
 
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliff home and how to move people
 
02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
out of Glencliff home who are ready to
 
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
move out into community- based settings
 
02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
and everyone hoped that we would be all
 
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
done with that by now we're not done
 
02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
with that by now it the state is not
 
02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
reached compliance and instead um
 
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
there's been some backsliding frankly um
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
we've got more people now at New
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital than were at New
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital I believe when we
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
filed the lawsuit so my when you're you
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
know I'm hearing the testimony and when
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about takeaways one of the
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
takeaways for me is that we've got more
 
02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
than a hundred people at New Hampshire
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
hospital on a daily basis who are ready
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
for discharge and are not appropriately
 
02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
placed there and these are people who
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
might be able may have lost their jobs
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
because they've been absent for so long
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
and could return to work um people who
 
02:35:30.670 --> 02:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
are I mean it's really about the patient
 
02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
care from our perspective but it's also
 
02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
costing the state $1,600 a day for each
 
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
of these people who would really
 
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be there similarly our office
 
02:35:42.429 --> 02:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
believes that there's people at Glen
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
Cliff home who don't believe who don't
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
belong there um the CMHA was amended um
 
02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
in 20
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
23 to address um discharge issues from
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliffe um and so one of the results
 
02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
of that um amendment is that the state
 
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
um issued an RFP as was mentioned to
 
02:36:07.830 --> 02:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
establish um 20 Community beds for
 
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
people who are at glencliffe or at risk
 
02:36:12.870 --> 02:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
of entering glencliffe who would be
 
02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for discharge so I don't
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
have the up-to-date numbers but a
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
question might be how many of those are
 
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
online and how many are still are
 
02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
available and how many people at
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
glencliffe are also ready to transition
 
02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
to less restrictive
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
settings um like I said I don't have the
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
up-to-date numbers on that but it seems
 
02:36:36.070 --> 02:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
to me that um the in you know when we're
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
looking at how to invest our state our
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
general funds which I know are extremely
 
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
precious right now we might want to
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
consider um the what what are the
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
options and what options might we want
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
to invest in
 
02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
so the fact that you know you might wait
 
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
a long time to have to get begin getting
 
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
services at community at a community
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
based Mental Health Center is
 
02:37:01.790 --> 02:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
problematic um we need people to be able
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
to have smooth transitions to intense
 
02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
community- Based Services if that's what
 
02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
they need um because we don't really
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
want them in really restrictive settings
 
02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
and Glen Cliff remember it is for people
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
who have a combination of mental health
 
02:37:17.790 --> 02:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
issues and also have a nursing home
 
02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
level of care need so it's really not
 
02:37:23.110 --> 02:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
always an it's probably not generally an
 
02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate discharge place for people
 
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire hospital unless they
 
02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
also need that level of nursing home
 
02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
care so it's it's just another it's
 
02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
another wrinkle it's another challenge
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
but I think we need to try to focus on
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
when we have very fleeting dollars small
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
dollars how can we make sure that our
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
community mental health system is
 
02:37:47.269 --> 02:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
appropriately funded um so that we're
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
not spending all this money to house
 
02:37:51.269 --> 02:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
people inappropriately in a really
 
02:37:54.190 --> 02:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
restrictive setting anyway thank you for
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
indulging me when you're all starving
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
will you take a question of course do
 
02:38:00.910 --> 02:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
you have a plan or a
 
02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
proposal i g I gave you my broad brush
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
um you know think about the investment
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
in Community Based Services for think
 
02:38:09.269 --> 02:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
talk to our community based Mental
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
Health Centers what the services are
 
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
that they're providing encourage the
 
02:38:16.269 --> 02:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
state to that's not not has that not
 
02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
happened well I think it needs to happen
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
to a I think there's some of that
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
happening I think they're the ones who
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
know what they need to implement the
 
02:38:27.630 --> 02:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health agreement um but
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
you know like I said there are services
 
02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
that people need that I think could be
 
02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
provided through their um
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
programs um and I don't know that and
 
02:38:39.550 --> 02:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
what do they need to increase their
 
02:38:42.269 --> 02:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
capacity to do that that's the question
 
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
for for the state and for them
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know that we have them come
 
02:38:50.830 --> 02:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
to our any of our hearings since we
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
don't fund them directly I don't know
 
02:38:54.429 --> 02:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
that they're in our budget at all so
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
therefore we're not talking with them
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
this committee right there's no I
 
02:38:59.750 --> 02:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
understand that there's a pass through
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
from the Department that goes to the
 
02:39:04.590 --> 02:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers um and I
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
and I realize that there's I think
 
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's directed payments that for about
 
02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
$5 million for each of the next two
 
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
years that would that's in the
 
02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
governor's budget I don't is that enough
 
02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
I don't to do what they need to do to
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone who needs to
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
have act screening for example gets it
 
02:39:23.070 --> 02:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
and and needs those really intensive
 
02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services is able to get
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
it are the reimbursement rates for those
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
Services high enough so that they can
 
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
retain the staff to provide the services
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
I I mean we're we're not if we're seeing
 
02:39:36.910 --> 02:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
so many people who can't be discharged I
 
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
would say I would suggest all right
 
02:39:40.110 --> 02:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
problem representative priest thank you
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for being here
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
and for everything you do um do you know
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not there a Coordinating
 
02:39:54.670 --> 02:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
Board that brings in organizations like
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
you the community health
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
boards um Glen Cliff the New Hampshire
 
02:40:06.190 --> 02:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
hospital and say okay how many patients
 
02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
do you have to be discharged what do we
 
02:40:10.990 --> 02:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
have in the community base that can
 
02:40:15.070 --> 02:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
facilitate them or are they or are they
 
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
on their own and there's no discussion
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
going on over writing discussion well I
 
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
think there is the I think you heard
 
02:40:26.590 --> 02:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
about the I forget what they call it the
 
02:40:29.309 --> 02:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
care trans the you know the the
 
02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
Coordinating Committee that the
 
02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
department has set up for people you
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
know who are you know entering the
 
02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
mental health system the care care
 
02:40:38.550 --> 02:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
traffic control yes um we're not part of
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
that um and I don't know that it would
 
02:40:42.309 --> 02:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for us to be part of that
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
actually um what we're part of is you
 
02:40:47.790 --> 02:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
know we we are in communication with the
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
Department about compliance with the
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement but you know and
 
02:40:54.670 --> 02:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that our office F you
 
02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
know follows closely because of this
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
agreement and the litigation but um
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
we're not part of that kind of committee
 
02:41:02.269 --> 02:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
and like I said I don't know that it
 
02:41:05.469 --> 02:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for us to
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
be do you attend those meetings or are
 
02:41:11.910 --> 02:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
you in traffic no care traffic control
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
no okay and so it's called the care
 
02:41:18.670 --> 02:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
trafficking control okay that was you
 
02:41:20.110 --> 02:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
probably know the answer better than I
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
do I think that's what they call it is
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
the care traffic control it's when
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
people come into the system and they're
 
02:41:26.469 --> 02:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
looking at what you know where they need
 
02:41:29.070 --> 02:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
to be placed and they addressed all the
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
present hospitals I I you know what
 
02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
since I'm not on that committee I think
 
02:41:34.750 --> 02:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
it would be better you should ask the
 
02:41:38.429 --> 02:41:38.439 align:start position:0%
department about that okay thank
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
you did you have a question represent
 
02:41:46.030 --> 02:41:46.040 align:start position:0%

thanks
 
02:42:13.950 --> 02:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
um and I think representative Mooney
 
02:42:15.950 --> 02:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
wants to draw our attention to something
 
02:42:19.389 --> 02:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
she's she's drawn at least uh one line
 
02:42:22.269 --> 02:42:22.279 align:start position:0%
between two dots go go ahead thank you
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so to representative
 
02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:26.000 align:start position:0%

02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
page five of the New Hampshire hospital
 
02:42:32.399 --> 02:42:36.510 align:start position:0%
page five of the New Hampshire hospital
coloring

02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:38.670 --> 02:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
book okay thank
 
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
you and and then you have a second
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
thing what uh is it is it for the good
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee or is it for the public
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh for everybody oh
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay so I think we've heard from
 
02:42:55.230 --> 02:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
everyone in the audience M Mr Ripple I
 
02:42:57.389 --> 02:42:57.399 align:start position:0%
like ending with you we're we're going

to get together at 10:00 tomorrow to do
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
the P dab yes I've been asked how long
 
02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
that is uh I think that should take
 
02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
based on what I know of what we need to
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
talk about I think we can nail that in
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
in an hour oh my uh I know Mr White's
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
got conflicting things so um so so I'll
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
try to keep that one pretty short
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and then do are we meeting tomorrow
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%

have anything else for us but you're but
 
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to get um a um a calendar
 
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
into for Monday with the three bills so
 
02:43:54.510 --> 02:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
so yes so Janet has already sent out
 
02:43:56.110 --> 02:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
that notice and it will be in this
 
02:43:59.790 --> 02:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
week's House calendar okay great uh
 
02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
02:44:03.790 --> 02:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
chairman so I don't want to lose sight
 
02:44:06.030 --> 02:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
of and I want to bring your attention to
 
02:44:07.950 --> 02:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
547 this has been the topic of quite a
 
02:44:13.230 --> 02:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
bit of discussion so far and I can just
 
02:44:15.030 --> 02:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
imagine it'll come into our work
 
02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
sessions that's relative to County
 
02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of funds now I noticed
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
that was on the consent calendar last
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
week that's a whole another discussion
 
02:44:27.309 --> 02:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
passed on a Voice
 
02:44:31.309 --> 02:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
vote pretty substantial fiscal note 25
 
02:44:32.910 --> 02:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious does that come to
 
02:44:34.190 --> 02:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
division three or has that been
 
02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
reassigned or not a signed yet so
 
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
that I really hate saying this because I
 
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's not firm but I I think we probably
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
have to be looking at 200 to $250
 
02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:49.870 align:start position:0%
have to be looking at 200 to $250
million

02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:52.230 --> 02:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm not happy about it I'd much
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
rather be doing out an extra $250
 
02:44:58.670 --> 02:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
million but uh that's not what's going
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
to happen this year does that answer
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
your question sufficiently for
 
02:45:09.630 --> 02:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
now yes that ansers answers it and when
 
02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
is work going to start on that
 
02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
process well this is the really hard
 
02:45:19.230 --> 02:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
part to say I I have imagined that um uh
 
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative tersi has been organizing
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
some discussions with
 
02:45:28.590 --> 02:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
with four NS of the committee or 47s
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the right fraction is to figure
 
02:45:33.870 --> 02:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
out what how you guys would want to
 
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
respond and and I I know that I've been
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
having meetings with the Republican side
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
to talk about how we want to respond you
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
you C you can
 
02:45:47.469 --> 02:45:47.479 align:start position:0%
imagine um you know the pressure we're
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
feeling to do this well and do it
 
02:45:52.349 --> 02:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
responsibly because so many lives are
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
affected and we I think we're having an
 
02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
internal conversation ourselves for now
 
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
to just figure out what we what we think
 
02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
right looks like before
 
02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
we expose more to the public but there
 
02:46:09.790 --> 02:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
will be a public phase there'll be there
 
02:46:12.349 --> 02:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
will at least is a minimum there will at
 
02:46:15.550 --> 02:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
least be a period where we bring forward
 
02:46:18.349 --> 02:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
sort of the Republican proposal to hit
 
02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
whatever final number we're supposed to
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
hit we'll go over it we'll give everyone
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
on the committee some soak time to look
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
at it and then we'll have a second
 
02:46:33.030 --> 02:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
meeting and in that second meeting it'll
 
02:46:35.550 --> 02:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
be like an exec session where we can
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
debate some of the line items and we'll
 
02:46:41.070 --> 02:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
end up voting on what our recommendation
 
02:46:44.030 --> 02:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee is and if you
 
02:46:46.750 --> 02:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
and if you guys were doing something
 
02:46:49.950 --> 02:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
similar we we we could similarly
 
02:46:52.349 --> 02:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
included in a public
 
02:46:54.990 --> 02:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
discussion so do you see that happening
 
02:46:58.830 --> 02:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of next week I I don't know
 
02:47:00.590 --> 02:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
after we look at the calendar we're
 
02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
running out of we're running out of time
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
since you invoked my name if I might no
 
02:47:07.150 --> 02:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
you had your light on I I just
 
02:47:09.870 --> 02:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
recognized the brightness of your
 
02:47:14.110 --> 02:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
light um we did receive a number of um
 
02:47:17.230 --> 02:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
notices of work sessions coming I guess
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't before the public
 
02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
hearing dig in too much but to know that
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to I assume hit the ground
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
running next Monday on this work would
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
be helpful I guess I just want to
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
clarify what you just said which is
 
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
there would be a presentation from your
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
side we would then reflect on it and
 
02:47:40.030 --> 02:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
come back and vote on it which doesn't
 
02:47:41.870 --> 02:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
seem to be the process we've used in
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
previous bium I don't know is it so much
 
02:47:48.030 --> 02:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
different yeah I I I mean I I I've had
 
02:47:49.830 --> 02:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
people tell me who who served on the
 
02:47:51.630 --> 02:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh back when they were in the
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
minority and basically it was a take it
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
or leave it well that's what it just
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
sounded like it would be Mr chairman uh
 
02:48:00.550 --> 02:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
no I I'm I'm going to I'm going to share
 
02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
it and tell you what our thoughts are
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
and we'll have an open public talk and
 
02:48:06.750 --> 02:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
every the world will see what we're
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
thinking and why we're thinking it so if
 
02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
I may yeah if we could have those
 
02:48:13.870 --> 02:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
conversations early on so that it's not
 
02:48:16.269 --> 02:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
the last day before we have to move the
 
02:48:18.349 --> 02:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
budget so that the public is aware of
 
02:48:20.429 --> 02:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
what's happening and is going to see
 
02:48:22.750 --> 02:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
where we're going to cut $200 to $250
 
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
million that's I'm concerned about
 
02:48:29.389 --> 02:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
transparency I so am I
 
02:48:33.190 --> 02:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
great I always have been always will be
 
02:48:34.990 --> 02:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's almost my middle
 
02:48:38.830 --> 02:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
name um but uh so we have to make sure
 
02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
that we we're going to have to be
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
finished by the day that we're supposed
 
02:48:46.349 --> 02:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
to be finished and uh and we have to
 
02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
back off from there to use available
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
time so I don't I don't have a proposal
 
02:48:54.429 --> 02:48:54.439 align:start position:0%
on our calendar
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
yet but the methodology is at least a
 
02:48:59.950 --> 02:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
two-step process at least a two-step
 
02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
process last last time I remember we
 
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
started with the idea we'd do a two-step
 
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
and it end up being three-step so so I I
 
02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
do I do think it's
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
flexible and I do think we can
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there's going to be a
 
02:49:15.790 --> 02:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
significant amount of
 
02:49:19.469 --> 02:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
disagreement so um we need to make sure
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
that that the all the disagreements get
 
02:49:24.910 --> 02:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to be
 
02:49:28.670 --> 02:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
aired that's all I was asking for I I
 
02:49:31.309 --> 02:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
think it's a fair request thank you very
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
much anyone else do you have you have
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
you want to go through notices yes so
 
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so yes as we've
 
02:49:40.630 --> 02:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
been sitting here in committee this
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
morning for division three notices have
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%

those notices have come out as we've
 
02:50:12.510 --> 02:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
been seated here so they're nondescript
 
02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
reservations of dates and times that we
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%

02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
published go ahead that was a question
 
02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
yes the answer is yes and I see another
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%

full finance committee when is when is
 
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
the full finance committee planning to
 
02:50:58.910 --> 02:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
get together do you know
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh I need to check on the date that the
 
02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
full finance committee uh will be
 
02:51:04.590 --> 02:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
meeting I don't think that's been
 
02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled yet I had been hoping that the
 
02:51:10.229 --> 02:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
division and I know the other divisions
 
02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
have been relying on this as well would
 
02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
be finished
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
by I think the if the 26th is a
 
02:51:19.469 --> 02:51:19.479 align:start position:0%
Wednesday sorry let me just take a look
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
at the calendar
 
02:51:23.790 --> 02:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
here yeah would be finished by March
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
26th and if necessary Friday the 28th so
 
02:51:29.710 --> 02:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
yes I did ask Janet to uh schedule the
 
02:51:31.630 --> 02:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
following Monday Tuesday and Wednesday
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
of each of the next two weeks as generic
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
budget work sessions with the exception
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the bills on Monday um I was not
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily assuming that there would be
 
02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
a proposal first thing on Tuesday
 
02:51:44.269 --> 02:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
morning but I wanted to have the date
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
reserved for Budget work so I know
 
02:51:48.670 --> 02:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon for example the
 
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
department will be coming back for a
 
02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
discussion of contracts so some of that
 
02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
time will be devoted to follow-up
 
02:51:55.790 --> 02:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
information all
 
02:52:01.070 --> 02:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
right when when when is crossover April
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
10 so the house has to vote its position
 
02:52:07.349 --> 02:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
sometime before that
 
02:52:09.870 --> 02:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
obviously that when we vote on the 10
 
02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
the vote in Full House will be on April
 
02:52:14.830 --> 02:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
10th so I presume the full Finance needs
 
02:52:16.830 --> 02:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
to have the budget leave our possession
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
the previous Thursday at the latest
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
which is the 3rd of April okay which
 
02:52:24.349 --> 02:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
means if I'm doing my math correctly
 
02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
this division needs to be um done with
 
02:52:30.510 --> 02:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
our work by the previous end of week to
 
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
have things tied up right which is the
 
02:52:35.950 --> 02:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
26 which is the 26 28th depending on
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
that house session dat I I want us to
 
02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
aim at the 26th and only use the 28th as
 
02:52:42.830 --> 02:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
a break glass in case we we just need to
 
02:52:45.710 --> 02:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
do more my only question to that is I
 
02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
heard a uh hold on that for a session
 
02:52:52.110 --> 02:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
day am I making that up or am I
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
confusing my weeks 26th and 27th as
 
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
potential house session
 
02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:03.190 align:start position:0%
potential house session
yeah

02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:05.950 --> 02:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I hadn't heard the 26th but in that
 
02:53:08.269 --> 02:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
case possibly uh Friday the 28th would
 
02:53:10.349 --> 02:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
be the last day the division could work
 
02:53:10.359 --> 02:53:11.469 align:start position:0%
be the last day the division could work
oh

02:53:11.469 --> 02:53:11.479 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:53:14.429 --> 02:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we'll keep tightening
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
that up but that's the that's the broad
 
02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:18.670 align:start position:0%
that up but that's the that's the broad
sweep

02:53:18.670 --> 02:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
sweep
 
02:53:22.110 --> 02:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions issues just I go
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
ahead repr thank you Mr chairman I can
 
02:53:25.150 --> 02:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
trace that where we heard that on the
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
26th it's actually in the speaker's
 
02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
message in the calendar he says there is
 
02:53:31.429 --> 02:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
also a possibility that the house will
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
26th

02:53:47.269 --> 02:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
26th
 
02:53:50.429 --> 02:53:50.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh um I think I think we're done
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
and so I'm going to adjourn today's
