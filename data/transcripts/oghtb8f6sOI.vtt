some of our constituent groups
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
and it spurred a discussion that
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
generated more questions than answers
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
from the doe
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%

education the list of questions that we
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
generated during our last meeting
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
and they included things like questions
 
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 align:start position:0%

uh explanation of how the summer meals
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
appreciated as well
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
melissa white a division director for
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
learner support from the department of
 
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.150 align:start position:0%
learner support from the department of
ed

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
ed
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
and kelly rambo administrator for
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
nutrition programs and services at the
 
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'll start with um i have just taken all
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
of your questions and kind of put them
 
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
into a document for myself and then what
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
you have in the packet in front of you
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
is some of the detailed information and
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
so the first question that we had was
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
schools that do not have a breakfast
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
program so in your packet you'll find
 
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
a documentation that says breakfast
 
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.830 align:start position:0%
a documentation that says breakfast
twenty

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
twenty
 
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
one twenty two
 
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.909 align:start position:0%
one twenty two
and

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:56.950 align:start position:0%
and
this

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
right side you will see um zeros and
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
ones so it's sorted by that all of those
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
that are zero are those that do not
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
participate in the breakfast program for
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
this current year and all those that are
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
one um which would be the rest of the
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
terrific thank you um and so the
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
organizational name is the sau and then
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
you can see each specific school is the
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
and just so that you um understand this
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
it kind of goes along with the the
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
the i think leave the last question
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
and explain why new hampshire ranks
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
number 47 in the national school lunch
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
program so this document obviously shows
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
that we have a great deal of those that
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
are participating for 21 22 and that is
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
due to the free meals
 
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.909 align:start position:0%
due to the free meals
so

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.270 align:start position:0%
so
normally

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
normally
 
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.710 align:start position:0%
normally
pre-covered

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
pre-covered
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
there has been a struggle for new
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire schools to be able to
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
serve a breakfast program
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
and and some of those struggles or
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
factors that might contribute to that
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
staffing and that would be inclusive of
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
wages are they part-time are they
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
full-time if they're full-time then
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
obviously insurance comes with that
 
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.430 align:start position:0%
obviously insurance comes with that
and

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.710 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
lunch is obviously the the bigger time
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
that you would need people in so
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
so that's also taking consideration
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
um equipment do you have the right
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
equipment to be able to run a breakfast
 
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.790 align:start position:0%
equipment to be able to run a breakfast
program

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
are you serving in the hallway is it a
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
grab-and-go do you need kiosks so
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
there's all those things to think about
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
for for that program for breakfast
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
scheduling of the school day the school
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
day is obviously already the schedule is
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
and then that goes along with bus
 
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.670 align:start position:0%
and then that goes along with bus
schedules

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
schedules
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
is there enough time in the morning for
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
those students to get off the bus get in
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
and get a breakfast and so um all of
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
those things that
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
are to take into consideration are
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
actually at the local level that's not
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
something that the department of
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
education determines
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
kelly can i ask a question about the
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
list sure
 
00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
does this list include public
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
public charter
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
and privates that are participating in
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
the food program
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
this list is everyone that we have at
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
the department of education that would
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
or were not participate in the program
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
terrific thank you
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question is i i can't help
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
but notice that the first three
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
non-breakfast participants are the three
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
elementary schools in bedford
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
i also know that the intermediate the
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
middle and high school do participate in
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
in the breakfast program how common is
 
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.750 align:start position:0%
in the breakfast program how common is
that

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.829 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.389 align:start position:0%
um
it's

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
it could be more common um again with
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
staffing depending on where your your
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
staffing is at at the school could be
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
could be a factor like stated before
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
that if you serve more meals at the high
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
school than you would at the elementary
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
school then you have that staff in
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
um to be able to to serve that um the
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
time frame also in the morning might be
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
different for grab and go um you know at
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
the the middle school at the high school
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
they can handle a grab-and-go
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
situation whereas the elementary school
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
they might need a little bit more
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
guidance and also
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
the the staffing piece too is not only
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
the nutrition department staff but the
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
school staff needs someone in there to
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
be able to monitor if they're eating in
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria you need to have a monitor
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
in there too so there's a lot of factors
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
that go into
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
when thinking about you know running a
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
breakfast program
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative ellison thank you
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh if we were to back up this first
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
chart the breakfast 2021 to 22 like
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
before we got into uh you know
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility everybody's eligible would
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
these would these look the same i mean
 
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
these would these look the same i mean
today

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
um i can get that information for you
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
for for our next meeting okay i can pull
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
the um the same report for
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
um let's say 19 that's that's kind of
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
our year that that we're we're looking
 
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
our year that that we're we're looking
at

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
woodcock thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
um kelly thank you for taking this
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
question there's a personal question in
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
terms of vested interest uh i don't see
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
either of the charter schools from the
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
conway area
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh in your listening
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
period so that mean they did not apply
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
or they were not eligible one of those
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
um they might not run a mail program
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
through our through our program at all
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay so there could be then more than 30
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
we just don't know who they are
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
that would be correct yes thank you
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you manager
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative boehm
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just a question on what are we
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
doing here
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this meeting was to see
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
if we approve an interim study for this
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
and look like we are doing what the
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
committee is supposed to be doing that
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
we are going to
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
say bring forth next year or not we're
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
doing the committee's work that we're
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
going to propose happen
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
so i think we're this is going way
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
overboard of what we're doing actually
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
um representative bohm if you go back to
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
the discussion of this interim study
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
that we had when we met as a full
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee i raised that issue to
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd and chairman ladd jokingly
 
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd and chairman ladd jokingly
said

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
that he was going to make me the chair
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee because he saw this as
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
a good opportunity for us to discuss
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
the the issue as it related to all of
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
the food bills
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
so um i i understand that and i made a
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
joke about it and and said uh you know
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
we're having a committee to decide
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're having a committee
 
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.949 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're having a committee
and

00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
he suggested that we do the work anyhow
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah but the thing is it looks like no
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee were going
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
to recommend we have it anyway so
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
aren't we just pretty much wasting our
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
time we're going to bring this bill
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
forward next year anyway so to establish
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
the committee we are not establishing a
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee this is an interim study to
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
see if we should establish a committee
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're doing all that committee's work
 
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.030 align:start position:0%
we're doing all that committee's work
here

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
just clarification from the chair uh
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.629 align:start position:0%
that the
representative

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
is certainly
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
right in referencing one of the bills
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
that we have we have four others which
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
are deal with
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
various breakfast programs or various
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
feeding programs that it looks to me
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
like that's sort of what we're supposed
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
to study so it's that doesn't appear to
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
me that we're limited to one of the five
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
bills that that was
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
presented to us um we had a lengthy
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
discussion around the farm to school
 
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.829 align:start position:0%
discussion around the farm to school
bill

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
and when uh
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.629 align:start position:0%
we were
in

00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
respectful debate over that farm to uh
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
school bill
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
that was the first opportunity that
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative ladd took
 
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.470 align:start position:0%
representative ladd took
to

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
marrying all of the
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
food bills if you will
 
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.030 align:start position:0%
food bills if you will
into

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
a collective discussion i believe he saw
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
it uh representative boehm as
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
being an efficient way of looking at the
 
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
being an efficient way of looking at the
topic

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
and sort of uh doing a lot of the
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
actually i can just comment on that
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
right okay um
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i signed up for this committee to
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
become informed
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
so i think becoming informed is not a
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
waste of time uh and and i would go
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
along with what you're saying that's all
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
the bills all food stuff let's get
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
informed and move forward
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
the good news representative baum is
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
that i have promised that these meetings
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
will be succinct to the point and that
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
we will not uh labor here into the wee
 
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.470 align:start position:0%
we will not uh labor here into the wee
hours

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
well just just one point too i mean
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing all this work
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
not knowing who will even be here next
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
year to have to hear all this
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
information all all over again that's
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's truth in that
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay kelly continue melissa wherever
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
whatever direction you're going in
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
please continue okay thank you
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
um so the next question we had was the
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
startup cost to run a breakfast um and
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
and that is determined at the local
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
level that's not something that we can
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
determine at the state level for that
 
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.829 align:start position:0%
determine at the state level for that
and

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
to the other factors that i spoke about
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
um they're individualized to each sau
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
that would be staffing equipment
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
um schedule of the day bus schedules etc
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
so those are the things that that would
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
be determined for that so unfortunately
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's at a local level
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the number of students who qualify
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced meals
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
in your packet you're going to find
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
that we have printed out for you
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
some aggregate data for that
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you go behind the national school
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
lunch program one
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
these are
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
landscape and there should be data from
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
18 19
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
19 20
 
00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:56.550 align:start position:0%
19 20
20

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
21 and 21 22.
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
and the reason for looking at those is
 
00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
and the reason for looking at those is
1819

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
1819
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
like i said before is our kind of our
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
target that is pre-coped that that we've
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
been using
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
moving forward we we know that 1920 was
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
the start of covet and
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
2021 and 21-22
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
are when meals have been free for for
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
those so i just wanted you to have all
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
and just to add to that
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
we did see about a 25 reduction in
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
families filling out the free and
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
reduced forms
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
compared to before the pandemic versus
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic when those meals
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
for all
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
great continue okay
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you and so the nutrition
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
standards were another question that
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
were raised so also in your packets you
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
will see that
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
right behind those the national school
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
lunch meal program standards are in
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
there also the breakfast programs are
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
right behind that
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
then following that are the sodium
 
00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.350 align:start position:0%
then following that are the sodium
targets

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
targets
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
and there is and i know this um
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
might be a little much and confusing to
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
to look at but i just wanted you to have
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
all the the information in front of you
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
the one behind that
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
whether you run a three day four day or
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
five day program at your school and the
 
00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:40.470 align:start position:0%
five day program at your school and the
one

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
last one behind that is the
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
newest from the usda they're the
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
transitional standards
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
and those are going to be for milk whole
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
can i ask you a question on that one
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
so did you
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
have you seen the bill from last session
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
on nutritional standards that was
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
talking about sodium levels and whole
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
grains and yes i mean it was estimated
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
that it was going to require six
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
additional staff members at the
 
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
additional staff members at the
department

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
to administer
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
the reduction of
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
sodium levels and
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
how how do the standards that are
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
currently in place
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for for both of us we were
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
not here during um that ta that was
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
given so um
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
if we could we could come back to the
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
answer for that question okay
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
just i just want to make sure i
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
understand it and answer appropriately
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no i just want to make sure
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
that you know which bill i'm referencing
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
it was house bill 1561
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment to it
 
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.310 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment to it
it

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
all of these bills were ultimately found
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate but i think
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
that you know a lot of the reason that
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
that these bills were scuttled was
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
because of the price tag that was
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
associated with it
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious as to
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
the standards that they were proposing
 
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.590 align:start position:0%
the standards that they were proposing
how

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
what has happened in the interim how do
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
they stack up next to what you're
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
already doing
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
and you know would it actually cost 445
 
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
and you know would it actually cost 445
000

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
to lower sodium standards and
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
increase whole grains or whatever
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
there's a financial note on that bill so
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
when you look at it you'll see what they
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
estimated as the cost okay
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and we will get back to you on
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
that one perfect
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative woodcock thank you a
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
question on
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
my own notification uh on the one that
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
dealt with the the uh
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
calculations for the usda thank you
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you uh i i think you may
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
have explained this the other day when i
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
was not here so maybe that i apologize
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
for not being here um
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
the three four five three four six days
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
sequence i i don't understand that
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's very it's a confusing um
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
kind of confusing document so um there
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
might be schools that only operate three
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
days a week um and and keep in mind this
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
is a usda document so it's it's more for
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
the whole state of the united states so
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
can you just tell me which one you're
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
looking at yes so it is it looks like
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
this one it's a stapled page and it says
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
short term short and long lingual
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
calculations yeah okay
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
so here in new hampshire um we follow
 
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.710 align:start position:0%
so here in new hampshire um we follow
the

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
this would be for um
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
let's say if you had a
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
residential or non-residential location
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
that you were serving for and the
 
00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.510 align:start position:0%
that you were serving for and the
students

00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
would live there or stay there you would
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
operate six days a week or you'd operate
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
seven days a week so this is um kind of
 
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.029 align:start position:0%
seven days a week so this is um kind of
the

00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
unusual norm
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
um if you didn't run a five day a week
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
program i just wanted you to have this
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
this documentation okay and i apologize
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you so much for clarifying
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
i find is there no five day schedule
 
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.549 align:start position:0%
i find is there no five day schedule
so

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the normal five-day schedule is the
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
single page that is in front of you um
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
that is just and i i probably should
 
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.350 align:start position:0%
that is just and i i probably should
have

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
um left that out maybe lesson is more on
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
that um so the the five-day schedule are
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
the two single pages that you have and
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
that would be for lunch and then the
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative ellison uh
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily on this particular chart
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
is it okay to ask a question
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
let me just uh see if i can save these
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
guys from us
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
playing pac-man with the information
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
here um
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions about
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
the five-day schedule and the foods that
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative ellison you're on
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
sort of shifting over to once again the
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
participation rates
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh the food research and action center
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
lists new hampshire as 50th in terms of
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
participation when you look at the
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
number of students who are in
 
00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:42.710 align:start position:0%
number of students who are in
the

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
lunch program
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
versus or part of of the breakfast
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
program and they list us at 38 or 37
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard as you know to kind of
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
find comparable states
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
but i i pulled maine and vermont maine
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
is at 57 for months at 61 in terms of
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
participation rate
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on your part about why
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's this differential in terms of
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
more students being served breakfast who
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
are eligible in those two states than in
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
like i stated before for breakfast
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
there's a number of factors that that
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
could contribute to that i can't speak
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
directly because it is a local level
 
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.470 align:start position:0%
directly because it is a local level
decision

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
we have seen with the obviously in the
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
data you can see in front of you with
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
the availability of free meals there is
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
an increase in in that participation so
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
those are all things to take into
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
consideration on that
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
the aggregate data that we have to
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
melissa's point previously we have seen
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
a decrease in um
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
families filling out the applications so
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
i know there is a
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
a big concern for that obviously next
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
year as the meals do
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
revert back to and and the waivers that
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
are currently in place
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
um expire on june 30th okay excuse me
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up um
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
then in in looking at this data once
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
again and i understand the explanation
 
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
again and i understand the explanation
uh

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
are you in a position
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with these other states
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
saying what are you doing we're not
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
doing because i assume
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
that this they deal with the same issues
 
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.470 align:start position:0%
that this they deal with the same issues
around

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
fewer people filling out the
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
applications i assume they deal with
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
local school budgets and money i mean
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
what what do they do that we're not
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
doing i guess that's my question
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
i think that that would be you know
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable for us to reach out to to
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
gather more information from the other
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
states to see if there's chart you know
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
there's something specific if there's
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
funding that they provide to the schools
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
specifically for this purpose so yes we
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
can definitely research that with with
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh our neighboring states and then also
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
we'll look at um
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
other states that are
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
comparable to us like the dakotas
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
and montana we tend to look at them
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
because even though they're very large
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
states they tend to have a very small
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
population like we do i'd be great i'd
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
be very interested in whatever you would
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
could come up with great yeah in some of
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
the reading that i've done i i don't
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire is the only state
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
that has struggled with
 
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.830 align:start position:0%
that has struggled with
outreach

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
outreach
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know i i i think this is probably a
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
golden opportunity time this transition
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
back into
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
sort of our new normal from the pandemic
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
into looking at you know what kinds of
 
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.669 align:start position:0%
into looking at you know what kinds of
things

00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
are are other states doing if they are
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
or you know is new hampshire in a
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
position to be
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a trailblazer on how to get to
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
as many of those kids families as we can
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
because my
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
like you i my fear is that
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
because we've now had years of uh
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
free meals for everybody
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
that parents are going to be under the
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
assumption that they don't have to fill
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
out paperwork and then you find out that
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
you do have to fill out the paperwork
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
and by the time you fill the paperwork
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
out you've missed the deadlines and uh
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
you know there's all kinds of
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
complications out there so
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
i would uh
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
i would think that we would want to at
 
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
i would think that we would want to at
least

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
consider those
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
things thank you
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
how about arpa funds
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
has the school
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
lunch program uh
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
received arba funds utilized arpa funds
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
are you on the radar so the schools are
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
eligible to use their arpa funds for
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
this purpose it's considered an
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
allowable use of funds but
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
because the meals are free
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
and the funding is already there they're
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
choosing then to use the arpa funds for
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
other purposes as opposed to using it
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
for this particular program since it's
 
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.269 align:start position:0%
for this particular program since it's
already

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
paid for yeah i was thinking more along
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
the lines of that public relations piece
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
of getting
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
applications into the hands of every
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
family that's eligible you know that
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
just a thought increasing the outreach
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean that is definitely
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
considered an allowable use of funds
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
so summer meals um just like the
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
the past two years have fallen into the
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
the um free or meals at no cost so this
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
year will be the first year that we're
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
reverting back to
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
what we call
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of acronyms so bear
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
so we have sfsp which is summer food
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
service program
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
we also have seamless summer option
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
which we
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
is sso which is currently what every
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
school is running now in new hampshire
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
for the free
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
free program that's just how the usda is
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
categorizing that
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
as far as funding is concerned for them
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
and we also have what's called extended
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
nutrition service lunch program so that
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be if a school doesn't qualify for
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
those other two programs they do still
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to every every
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
school has an opportunity to run a meal
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
program however it would be an extension
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
of what they do during the school year
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
meaning that meals could be free reduced
 
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.230 align:start position:0%
meaning that meals could be free reduced
paid

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
and applications would be needed for
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility whereas the other two um
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
there's aggregate data that usda uses to
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
to categorize those that might fall into
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
it for
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you very
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
much uh on the ss
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
program yeah uh towns and cities that
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
use uh recreation departments and those
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
facilities that that's where that money
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
comes from that program
 
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.669 align:start position:0%
comes from that program
um

00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
so those would
 
00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:16.789 align:start position:0%
so those would
there

00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
would be considered camps so summer is a
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
very complex um program when when it's
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
broken down
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors that would sponsor a maybe a
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
program that couldn't um
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
that couldn't do it itself so we have a
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
great number of sponsors in new
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire that pick up um
 
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire that pick up um
the

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
let's say the administration for for
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
those programs and then um
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
so those would be those would fall under
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of um program so they might
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
have a sponsorship to be able to do that
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions of us or would
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
you just like to continue
 
00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:09.510 align:start position:0%
you just like to continue
um

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
nope i think we're good all right um
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
so charter school participation
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
if you turn in your packet to
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
those are all of our current
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
sites that participate in the national
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
school lunch program
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
whether it be breakfast or lunch so it's
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
kelly do you offhand know how many
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
charter schools are participating
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
on the back last page
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's six public charter schools and
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
eight private schools
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:14.710 align:start position:0%
eight private schools
okay

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
and just a note also this is not the
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
total number of public schools that's
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
obviously individual schools and not
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
saus that's why it's
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
without looking at this and not
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
expecting you really to have the answer
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
to this but of those charters that are
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
participating do they tend to be more
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
urban than rural or
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
evenly split rural than urban
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
that is something that um unfortunately
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
due to my newness
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
in the department i don't know that off
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
the top of my hand but i can find that
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
information we frequently ask questions
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
that you you should not know the answer
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
to off the top of your head so don't
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
so there is no requirement for any
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
school district to participate in the
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
national food program
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
um you mean in order to run a school
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that is correct
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
so they can privatize it they can offer
 
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
so they can privatize it they can offer
no

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
food program whatsoever
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
well that was my question ralph can you
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit about that do you
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
know anything about how they're how they
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
they're going about that i don't know
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
how they're doing it but they decided
 
00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:01.669 align:start position:0%
how they're doing it but they decided
that

00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
they weren't gonna because the food that
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
government said hey this is what you
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
have to make the lunches you have to
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
provide we're getting thrown away
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things we've got to
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
look at when we say hey this is the food
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
that i eat well the kids eat it
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
right that's one of the problems we have
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh so london they're asking what how
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
they're doing they're offering lunches
 
00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:36.070 align:start position:0%
they're doing they're offering lunches
right

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
and when i was on the school board
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
in in litchfield what
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with what was
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
happening is before they came up with
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
what you have to
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
the biggest money maker that the
 
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.750 align:start position:0%
the biggest money maker that the
student-run

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
student-run
 
00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.190 align:start position:0%
student-run
shop

00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
shop
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
had was selling french fries at
 
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
had was selling french fries at
lunchtime

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
because the lunch program wasn't
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
but then they sort of stopped it because
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
but that was the students run bring
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
running they sell other things school
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
supplies and and whatnot but they were
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
selling french fries at lunchtime and
 
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.589 align:start position:0%
selling french fries at lunchtime and
that's

00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
what their biggest money maker so the
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
thing is we've got to be careful of
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
what we say kids have to eat because
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you the
 
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.349 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you the
purification

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
purification
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
on the national school lunch program
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
site the document you provided i'm just
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
listening to reverend bowen i'm looking
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
at page two and i see that the five
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
or six uh londonderry schools
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
participate i'm now at least 20 21. does
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
that mean they have to follow the
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
regulations of the
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
that that information actually a little
 
00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.990 align:start position:0%
that that information actually a little
dated

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
dated
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps they weren't participating in
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
the past but
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
now they are okay but if they
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
participate now they have to follow the
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
the next question that i have on here is
 
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
the next question that i have on here is
um

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
the participation rate from last year
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
that school districts use applications
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
from parents for program eligibility um
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately since for the last two
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
years meals have been free um
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
applications did not need to be
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
collected for for that um so that's kind
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
of where the the lack of data for for
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
that particular thing is
 
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.950 align:start position:0%
that particular thing is
and

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
we did summer programs i feel like there
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
yep i think that we um that we got them
 
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.349 align:start position:0%
yep i think that we um that we got them
all

00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
i'm very impressed
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
last week when i asked for questions
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
from members of our committee i said to
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
them you know you've got like 10 minutes
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
to get me these questions because i
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how these guys are going to
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
be able to pull all this information
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
together in two work days but uh well
 
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.630 align:start position:0%
together in two work days but uh well
done

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
well done other questions representative
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
ellison um this is probably maybe to to
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh oliver but you might comment on this
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
oliver just did a survey and got a
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
survey on homeschooling which has a
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
whole lot of comments about i
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
participate i won't the government can't
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
touch the food or i really like it the
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
school drops off
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
food for my kids once a week
 
00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:51.510 align:start position:0%
food for my kids once a week
where

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
what's your sense oliver what the
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
requirement maybe
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
what the requirement is around
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
homeschooling or the opportunity is
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
i know no more than you know because
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
that chart is what i got in response to
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
my query okay and so we can all
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
interpret it together which is why i
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
copied it to everyone uh because i was
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
flabbergasted i started from the
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the one thing that was
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
missing to me as a person who used to do
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of research in various things
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
because no one was talking about
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
efficacy they were only talking about do
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
you do it or don't you do it and i
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
wanted you to know how much difference
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
it made when students had breakfast
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
how much me when they had dinner so i
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
turned to my in-house expert my wife
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
and she's the former director of state
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
director of special ed and has a long
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
history of teaching in those and she
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
tells me exactly what some of you were
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
saying the other day
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
that she took it out of her own pocket
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
provided food for the students getting
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
off the bus so they would have enough in
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
their stomach to be able to study
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
and she said it's not uncommon and sure
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
enough in those things you get
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
tales of people teachers taking money
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
out of their pocket and buying food for
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
the students
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's a special ed teacher or
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
just a classroom teacher and so i'm
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
beginning to think i said
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes there's a felt need
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
but where's the data on the difference
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
it makes and i was astounded not to find
 
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
it makes and i was astounded not to find
any

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
so i called to
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
dr aaron sharp at unh
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
who's the associate dean of health and
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i've asked her for
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
a study list for us
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
i've asked her for materials on research
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
having to do with school meals
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
and what there is about performance has
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
anyone done a pre and a post test
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
on this to say how much difference it
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
does make
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
because i thought that part is missing
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
from the data
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
and so i was sort of surprised that
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
nowhere and what you were sent was there
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
any question like that we're just doing
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
it because we assume it's better
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
well yeah if i were hungry i'd assume
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
that too but
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's nice if you do a study
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
if you cover your bases
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
and i think if we had the more data we
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
have the better case we're going to be
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
able to build for doing whatever is best
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
for the students
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
so that's that's how i got into this
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
business of doing that
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
oh madam chair
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative ellison um
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
back to the homeschooling thing would i
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
be correct then in in saying that
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
home school students are eligible or are
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
participating in
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
the the food program
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
based on a local option based on what
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
local school districts want to do or not
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
do would that be would i be correct with
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
that assumption
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
just to
 
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
just to
clarify

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
during coveted purposes there were some
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
districts that had the capability to
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
deliver meals home so i don't want there
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
to to be a confusion in in that respect
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
um so there was that capability running
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
this particular program that
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
you get into an open site school where
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
they they have the capability to be able
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
to to do that um but i'll let melissa
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
to the home school part
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
with regards to homeschool students they
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to participate
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
the homeschool students do have the
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
ability to participate in a lot of
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
programs so for example you can have an
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
instance where a student might come in
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
and take a few classes or they might um
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
be part of the the team a team or some
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
sort of uh activity or athletic athletic
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
activity and so this would qualify under
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
that like if the parents sought out
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's that resource they they would not
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
can i ask a follow-up to that melissa so
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
what if the child is not dually enrolled
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
if they're a full home school student
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
but they're eligible they meet the
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
criteria for free and reduced lunch i
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
mean i'm not talking coping i'm talking
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
either pre or postcoded would that
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
homeschool family be eligible for meals
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
if the child was fully homeschooled yes
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
i just haven't heard of any specific
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
cases and i could go back and try to
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
gather some more information i have not
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
heard of a specific case where
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
any home school
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
families are choosing to access the
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
school meals but i know that they would
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
still be eligible to receive the meals
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay maybe we'll send you the
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
information that representative ford
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
received because it looked like
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
responses where people were saying yes
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm taking advantage of it so it'll be
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
interesting see if it was just as a
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
result of kovid
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
how does that play out once the kofi
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
meals program ends
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative bone yeah also too on
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
other program this problem a lot of
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
individual school pro school districts
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
have different programs with different
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
things and it's kind of hard to collect
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
that data one of the good examples is
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
salem cte which is in salem high school
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
so it makes it easier
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
their culinary arts program
 
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
their culinary arts program
creates

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
creates
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
bar food boxes for kids on friday to
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
take home for their weekends
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
so i mean they're like i said there's
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
all kinds of different things going
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
around and it's up to different school
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
districts and and and they the first
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
part of it with this how do we know that
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
having a good people not having good
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
breakfast don't do good in school and
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah that's kind of impossible
 
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.510 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah that's kind of impossible
to

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
to really look at i mean you ask most
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
families that say do your kids eat
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
breakfast most are going to say yes
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be accused of
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
not taking care of their kids so those
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
questions those kind of statistics are
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to come up with um
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
i mean when i was in high school i very
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
seldom ate breakfast i barely sell them
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
eat breakfast now i mean i don't
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
my body doesn't like breakfast but i
 
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.589 align:start position:0%
my body doesn't like breakfast but i
mean

00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
but i do okay but anyway
 
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.109 align:start position:0%
but i do okay but anyway
but

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
so it depends and most parents
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
because i i mean
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have to know i'm
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
abusing my kid by not feeding them i
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
mean that's why the statistic like that
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
i think would be impossible to get
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
i just would like to add if it's okay
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
schools are eligible to use their
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
mckinney-vento funds mckinney-vento
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
funds are for
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
addressing the needs of homeless
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
students and so they are allowed to
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
utilize those funds specifically to send
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
home meal packages for the weekends and
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
that type of thing so schools can use
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily connected to
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition but they do
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
each of the school districts do receive
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative ellison thank you madam
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
i guess a request to someone that i'm
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
not sure who it goes to at this point
 
00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:36.950 align:start position:0%
not sure who it goes to at this point
but

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
i've seen lots and lots of research
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
about academic success and lack of
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
nutrition and
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
i think the committee we need to have
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
have that i don't know whether that's a
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
gen question or that's a question here
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
or it's a question here but i know
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's out there if you um
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hunger solutions last week
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
provided us with that information packet
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
and the last two articles are briefs
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
that provide copious amounts of research
 
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.750 align:start position:0%
that provide copious amounts of research
citations

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
citations
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
so um i mean i'm sure we could make a
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
specific request for follow-up articles
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
that they think might be germane but
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
but there certainly is is
 
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.390 align:start position:0%
but there certainly is is
a

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
vote load of
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
citations in the material that they gave
 
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:25.990 align:start position:0%
citations in the material that they gave
us

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative ford
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
partial response to my colleagues uh
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
comments here
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
one of the sources you might not think
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
of for this kind of information because
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
i admit parents do not want to admit
 
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.750 align:start position:0%
i admit parents do not want to admit
this

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
and and i can't blame them uh
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
but the school nurse is often the person
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
to whom the children are referred and
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
they keep records of what they did for
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
the child and so forth and so it would
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
be able to infer quite logically i think
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
from that kind of data that nutrition
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
and and sustenance
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
was a cause factor at least or somewhere
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
a factor in in performance and then you
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
could correlate that with academic
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
performance and began to make a a
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable assessment that there was a
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
connection there yeah i would guess that
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's done i mean i certainly
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
remember from my uh
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
pre-retirement days that
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
the statistics on feeding kids before
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
they took exams
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
was huge that were
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
they saw
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
real spikes and improvement when kids
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
ate before they had to sit and take any
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
kind of a standardized test yeah so uh
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so i would think that that is a is
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
a valid point representative ford and
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
as well as discipline beyond the
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
academic piece there's data reflect on
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
discipline performance by youngsters as
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:17.370 align:start position:0%
we have them
 
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:19.190 align:start position:0%
we have them
[Music]

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
i think probably uh we
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
go on recess as you well know during the
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
months of july and august so our next
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
meeting is going to be in september
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
so you folks are going to have plenty of
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
time to knock around the things that
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
we've talked about and i would also ask
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the committee again as
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
i did last week if you have questions or
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
particular points that you would like to
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
stress with kelly and melissa if you
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
want to funnel them through me
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
so that they're getting them from one
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
you notice that i we haven't gotten to
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
the point yet where we're saying well
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
what would you recommend
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's coming so so don't go anywhere in
 
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.950 align:start position:0%
that's coming so so don't go anywhere in
september

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much to the
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
do we have anyone else in the audience
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
that would like to
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
speak to anything that they've heard
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
now it's on right okay
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
director for the american heart
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
association in new hampshire
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
we were involved with representative
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
bernie deshay on coming up with
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
at least one of the bills that he had
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
filed 1561.
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
i do not work at the federal level but
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
we do have a staff
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
within the american heart association
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
that works directly with
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
the usda and other organizations and and
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
are very much a stakeholder at the table
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
around school nutrition standards
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
so what the representative wanted to do
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
was put forward a bill to help improve
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
the nutrition
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
standards of school meals and we took a
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
look at how far back it had been since
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had updated
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
state-based standards which again were
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
very much connected with the usda
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
food standards
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it had been a while it was actually
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
before the 2012
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
update to the federal nutrition
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
back in 2012 it was the healthy
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
hunger-free kids act that was the
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
impetus for
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
the federal nutrition standards
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
and from that point forward schools were
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
to follow a set of standards and we
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
found 99 percent of schools were able to
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
follow the standards that have been set
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
there were other standards coming along
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
for for the the future there was some
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
other updates around the competitive
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
foods because they didn't want the
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
competitive foods
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
to be competing with the nutrition
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
standards of the school meal so so that
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
was elevated as well and and schools
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
were able to um to meet those as well
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
starting i think it was back in 2017
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
um there were some roll backs at the
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.750 align:start position:0%
federal level
so

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
like the the sodium standards that were
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
discussed a little bit before there were
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
standards that were set with the
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
intention that you wouldn't just have an
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
immediate um move to what would be the
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
optimum sodium for for children to be
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
taking and they wanted to do a stepwise
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
so there was target one
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
then target two which hadn't been put
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
into play yet a target three and then
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
even a target four which leaves it to um
 
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.750 align:start position:0%
even a target four which leaves it to um
to

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
the states to also put together a plan
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this was all built into 1561
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
but with a little more progressive than
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
what the federal was putting out for
 
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.430 align:start position:0%
what the federal was putting out for
schools

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
at the same time you're looking at these
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
we realized there were many other issues
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
at play particularly with the covet
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
epidemic and the fact that there were um
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
you know products that just weren't
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
available to schools that had been
 
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.630 align:start position:0%
available to schools that had been
before

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
those supply chain issues so we wanted
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure there was some leeway in
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
that legislation to make sure those
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
waivers would be allowed for that as
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately from the writing of
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
the bill and moving forward things got
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
worse than get better
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
and there are the other issues that the
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
department had just outlined which is
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
also you know the the staffing and
 
00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:53.109 align:start position:0%
also you know the the staffing and
equipment

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
there were some grants that were given
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
to schools to do equipment to really be
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
able to follow those school nutrition
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
standards so you know it's not just
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
setting the standards i believe it's
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
also looking at the funding for
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
communities to be able to put this into
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
play um i really appreciate your you
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
know looking at this issue not just as
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
you know should we should we do a study
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
but looking into what the issues are
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
across the board we also would support
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
um you know a farm to school
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
program where because obviously the main
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
part of nutrition for for kids and
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
adults are those fruits and vegetables
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
that none of us are getting enough of
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
quite frankly but for children it is
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
really important that they that they do
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
there is food security but the american
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
heart association also is framing it as
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
nutrition security
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
and before you know we all leaked i do
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
have some handouts for you on some of
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
the information from the american heart
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
association on all that which you can
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
look at and if you have questions from
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
that i'm more than happy to help
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
fill in
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
some of some of the
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
the gaps in in knowledge that we might
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
have at this point we were also just
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
talking about studies and you know the
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
american heart association does a lot of
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
you know according to studies there is a
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
connection between what what children
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
eat not just the amount of food but the
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
nutritional level of that food and
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
academic performance i don't happen to
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
have with me even reference to what
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
those studies are so i'm glad we have
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
to provide you with some more
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
information because
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
there is a connection that that's made
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to just have it be
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
they say um you you need to have some of
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
those studies in front of you
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
we're still very interested in working
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
with um with
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as well as my colleagues
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
in other states on the nutrition
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
standards for schools what we were
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
looking at is
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
the the federal level sets the standards
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
that states need schools need to follow
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
if they are part of the
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
lunch and or breakfast program
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
what we would love to say because as we
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
know there are very
 
00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:03.190 align:start position:0%
know there are very
slow

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
slow
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
movement at the federal level on things
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
and what we just saw of the rollback of
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
these standards of the implementation of
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
these standards
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
is only going to hurt children and
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's really those children who
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
are the eligible for free and reduced
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
the low-income um
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
food security you know marginalized
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
families that we are very concerned with
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
as well we also very much support
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
moving to a healthy school meals for all
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's also referred to as universal
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
school meals it's what we've just
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
experienced over the past couple of
 
00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.789 align:start position:0%
experienced over the past couple of
years

00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
and the the point of that is is
 
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:43.589 align:start position:0%
and the the point of that is is
multiple

00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
they parents would not have to fill out
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
the materials information for the free
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
and reduced all children would be able
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
to participate in the school meals
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
program so it would take away the the
 
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.670 align:start position:0%
program so it would take away the the
stigma

00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
stigma
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
it would also provide more stable
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
revenue for school food service programs
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
which is also you know very very
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
important as we know um
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
going forward that there might still con
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be some new um some food
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues um
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
the people who are out there um ready to
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
fill jobs at
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
schools excuse excuse me may or may not
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
be um you know increasing um at the rate
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to see
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
so there's just a lot but we really need
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
to move in a direction where we are
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
providing you know as much nutrition to
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
students as they can
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
from our standpoint it's a health
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint we see children with you know
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
still have high obesity levels children
 
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.710 align:start position:0%
still have high obesity levels children
who

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
are showing pre-diabetes if not diabetes
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
there are so many children
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
who are taking in far too much sodium in
 
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
their diets and you know when we talk
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
about the taste of foods this is this is
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
an acquired taste that we all have for
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
foods that are high in sodium high in
 
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.470 align:start position:0%
foods that are high in sodium high in
sugar

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
sugar
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
we may not even know that some of these
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
foods contain sodium it doesn't taste
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
salty but it's in there and from the
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
food industry perspective this is the
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
cheaper way of of creating food
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
is using things like um salt products
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
for preservatives and flavor can i ask
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
am i
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly then that
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
what you were trying to do was to look
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
at returning the standards to the
 
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.789 align:start position:0%
at returning the standards to the
pre-2017

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
pre-2017
 
00:56:36.799 --> 00:56:38.230 align:start position:0%
pre-2017
level

00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's not so much that because those
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
standards hadn't necessarily
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
been been
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
the rollbacks were for the continuation
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
of the steps to get school nutrition
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
up to
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
the par of the dietary guidelines for
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
health for americans and basically those
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
scientific standards based around
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
children and what they what their
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
nutrient should be um you know the focus
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the bill was really sodium whole
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
grain um and we also put in sugar which
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
is not added sugar is not addressed at
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
the federal level on on school meals so
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
the reason i was asking that question is
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
because i just said to kelly and melissa
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
can you figure out
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
where in terms of the the standards that
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
were being proposed by the bill and
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
where we are now can you figure out
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
where the where there's a discrepancy
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
but you may already have the answer and
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
it really is it's moving on from the
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
sodium level one to the sodium level two
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
which in the bill that um representative
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
duchess had we were looking at that
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
starting in the school year 23 24.
 
00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.630 align:start position:0%
starting in the school year 23 24.
so

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
looking now obviously i think it was
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
february it was announced that the
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
federal government was going back to
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
putting in those transitional standards
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
to get schools given the schools two
 
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.829 align:start position:0%
to get schools given the schools two
years

00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
to get um you know
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
to the point where they're able to
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
decrease the sodium in in school foods
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
and you know make sure that the industry
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
is able to supply those foods because
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
now they know they need to
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
have those available
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
so great thank you so much
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
okay we're good thank you very much
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
and yes we'll take whatever you have to
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
hand out to us
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
and and we can supply you with with a
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
lot more than that so trying to be
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that not putting too much
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
on you all at once right so there's more
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
information in here than you probably
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
need for school meals but it's all part
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
of outside the physicians keep somebody
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
alive we'll take it
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
um i just have i have one more question
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
for the d.o.e uh if i if you don't kelly
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
did you just say no you're not answering
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
my question i meant to ask you about um
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid direct certification
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
and what you uh
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
what what you know about what's
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
last time around we were talking about
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know we had looked at
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid direct certification and there
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
were some concerns raised about security
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
of data and so i'm just wondering where
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
the department is in all of that
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
so currently the department really
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't um
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
take us a stance on this it's really up
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and then we will
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
follow through with the decision made by
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:59:32.559 --> 00:59:33.589 align:start position:0%
the legislature
currently

00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
right now the federals the federal
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
government has rolled out the pilot
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
program to allow those kids that are on
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid to qualify
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch automatically
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
so we would have the option to apply i
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
believe the application is due in
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
september so at this point new hampshire
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
couldn't participate because there's not
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
enough time to put together all of the
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
materials we would need to apply for
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
that program so it'd be something we
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
would be looking at for the following
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
year yeah
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
but the states that are participating in
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
that it's because they've gone through
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
and applied for that program
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
um and then they're
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
were approved to participate within that
 
01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.430 align:start position:0%
were approved to participate within that
program

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
the data security piece of it when we're
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
looking at doing we have currently have
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
an mou with dhhs right now and so
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's no exchange of data that's
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
happening it's it's they're providing us
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
information that's done at the local
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
level as far as the town
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
and then um perhaps like a student name
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
and then we're manually going in and
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
matching that within our own student
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
information system so we can look at
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um melissa white is located in
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
this town this is a student that is on
 
01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.430 align:start position:0%
this town this is a student that is on
medicaid

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then we would match that up to see
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
that if that is a student that is
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know on that roster and then
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
therefore that student would
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
automatically qualify this is how it
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
so the data exchange piece there's
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
nothing we are sending to dhhs
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's information that they are providing
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
to us and then we would not be releasing
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
out is there already a process for the
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
exchange of information that's what
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about when you say that
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
you there's a
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding between dhhs
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
and doe yes
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay so the process of exchanging
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
information is already happening to your
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge have there been data breaches
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
or any complication from the exchange
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
um and this is for
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
students for snap benefits tanf and i
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
believe wic
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
and those are all federally required so
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
do that exchange
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you i'm so happy i
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
remembered to ask you the question
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
i think it was on my list somewhere but
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
i had so many lists going that i may
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
have forgotten to send it to you
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions before the doe
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
all right thanks
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
okay so what's the committee got on
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.230 align:start position:0%
 
anything

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned we're obviously recessed
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
for july and august so i think that we
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
would be looking at our next meeting
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere the week of september 12th
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
i will have to coordinate that with
 
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
i will have to coordinate that with
our

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
master scheduler to make sure that we've
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
got space available and
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
if any of you have time in september
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
that you are unavailable if you would
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
let me know that would be great because
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
yeah not the 13th no i will not right
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
i will not ask you to commit on primary
 
01:03:03.039 --> 01:03:03.910 align:start position:0%
i will not ask you to commit on primary
day

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah in fact it would be it
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
in all in all uh we we don't have a dumb
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
primary um
 
01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.270 align:start position:0%
primary um
in

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
all likelihood we won't meet on the 12th
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
either we'll wait until after the
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
primary to see uh whether or not people
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
are still standing so
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
but uh the farm to table people
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
have indicated that they would like to
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
come in and speak
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
so far to table farm to school i wish it
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
was farm to table but
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not in school anymore so the farm to
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
school people would
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
like to come in um oliver i thank you
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%

01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
for that information on homeschoolers i
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
think we will have some time to digest
 
01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.950 align:start position:0%
think we will have some time to digest
it

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
maybe have some even even some more
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
questions for the doe when we get back
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
in september but also when i get a
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
response from
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
dean sharp
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
i will circulate that among the
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
committee certainly that's a and any
 
01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
committee certainly that's a and any
beginning

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
hit your microphone oliver
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
she did the work on extending the school
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
day she was actively involved in that
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
that whole process which is related to
 
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
that whole process which is related to
breakfast

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so she has some background in that
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
respect is and the the
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
function of that study and what she got
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
from it and so
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
my surmizeal is
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
that it'll be all tied into this this is
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
a multi-part
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
issue and and i think we're going to
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
have to look at all those parts oh
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely if we can just gather enough
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
information to streamline for ourselves
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
what we should be studying and what we
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.510 align:start position:0%
need to
study

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.230 align:start position:0%
study

thank you
representative

representative
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
woodcock your opinion that perhaps this
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee when they've done their
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
work in the fall are going to
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
promulgate a
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
single inclusive bill
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
no the function of the interim study
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
committee is to either recommend future
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend future
 
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.910 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend future
legislation

legislation
 
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.029 align:start position:0%
legislation
but

01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
it would be up to individual
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
representatives to craft anything that
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh that they were bringing forward that
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't that's not the function of
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
this committee okay thank you

output comes recommend do not recommend

nothing stop anybody from still putting
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
in a bill right
 
01:05:53.839 --> 01:05:59.109 align:start position:0%
in a bill right
