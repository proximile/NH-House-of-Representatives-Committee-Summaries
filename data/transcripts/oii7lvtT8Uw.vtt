00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
guardian has the right to determine the
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
child agenda for the purpose of school
 
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.070 align:start position:0%
child agenda for the purpose of school
records

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
and more importantly
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
to allow no no to require
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
that schools be proactive
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
by providing a record system that allows
 
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.110 align:start position:0%
by providing a record system that allows
staff

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
to use the current correct pronoun for
 
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.589 align:start position:0%
to use the current correct pronoun for
student

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
this bill came about last year on a
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
request from a parent rebecca nan
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
who has submitted written testimony but
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i will not be here today
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
to speak in person
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
i met rebecca a few years ago at a
 
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.309 align:start position:0%
i met rebecca a few years ago at a
seminar

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
seminar
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
put on by my local library
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
and that seminar focused on the many
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
implications issues
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
and discrimination
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
that parents and children faced
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
as members of the lgbt community
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
and as you may imagine they were
 
00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
and as you may imagine they were
numerous

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
numerous
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
so after the meeting i spoke with
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
several of the presenters regarding what
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
i or
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
we the house of representatives could do
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
to help
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
i was not looking for a laundry list but
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
rather one or two critical things that
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
we could do to make a child's school
 
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.949 align:start position:0%
we could do to make a child's school
experience

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
more healthy productive and safe
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
rebecca told me the story
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
the story of her child and the
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination that had to be incurred
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
regularly often annually to be specific
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
every year where a child changed grades
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
and had a new set of teachers
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
i'm not suggesting no issue
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
that the teachers the school
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
administration created this horrible
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
situation purposely
 
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.350 align:start position:0%
situation purposely
no

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
i'm presenting you the fact that
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
due to the schools antiquated system of
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
record-keeping and identification
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
the school became a partner
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
inadvertently and often unknowingly
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
providing the ammunition for bullying
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
harassment and discrimination in that
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
school building
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
we continue to hear in this chamber that
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
bullying is an extremely painful
 
00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.070 align:start position:0%
bullying is an extremely painful
experience

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
that negatively impacts the child and
 
00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:31.190 align:start position:0%
that negatively impacts the child and
family

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
and at a time it's often for years and
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes lifetimes
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
we hear about the families moving on
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
wanting to change schools
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
for the sole purpose of finding a school
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
that will provide a safe space
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
for meaningful learning
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
i am not here
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
to ask you to dive into the deep in the
 
00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.790 align:start position:0%
to ask you to dive into the deep in the
pool

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
pool
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
take a huge risk
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
or ask you to abandon your own lifelong
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
and historical understandings of what
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
you may believe as regards
 
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
the traditional roles of male and female
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
or for you to agree
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
with the parents determination or their
 
00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.389 align:start position:0%
with the parents determination or their
rationale

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
for requesting a non-binary
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
identification for the child
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
our responsibility
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
that is the parents
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and what you can
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
assist with
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
is to provide
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
relief for families
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
provide relief for children
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
and reduce the opportunity for in-school
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
bullying and discrimination which is a
 
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
bullying and discrimination which is a
result

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
of an outdated system of school record
 
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.389 align:start position:0%
of an outdated system of school record
keeping

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
keeping
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
hb 136
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
in on an annual basis
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
and or during the initial registration
 
00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:47.509 align:start position:0%
and or during the initial registration
period

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.389 align:start position:0%
period
oh

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
whoo thank you pie now mr chair my
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
battery was running low uh in the
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
computer i'm doing fine um
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
anyhow so what
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
allows the parents to identify the gen
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the child from school replicating
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
as miss nan wrote in her testimony often
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
her child was awfully incorrectly
 
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.670 align:start position:0%
her child was awfully incorrectly
addressed

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
for example when a substitute teacher
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
did not know how to correctly address a
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
non-binary child during attendance or
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
record keeping
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
or during iap meetings or parent-teacher
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
report conferences
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
these painful experiences were not a
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
human error
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
they were the result of not using
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
current technology
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
and the first step to alleviating that
 
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.110 align:start position:0%
and the first step to alleviating that
cause

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
of this child's pain is to require the
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
updating of current school records which
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
hb 136 does by requiring
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
one additional keystroke
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
we hear it during hb
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
1163 that currently small systems
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
often change their record systems
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
for one purpose or another
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
by doing an in-house no-cost workaround
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
we also heard that the larger systems
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
also could easily change their computer
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
system at no cost because there is a
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
clause in their contract that provides
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
if the law changes the provider will
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
upgrade the system at no cost
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
doe estimated last year during the
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
interim study that the changes if needed
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
at the oe may require around 20 000.
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
that is all
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
hb 136
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
does is request the option for parents
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
made by a simple
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
software upgrade
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
how many times this year have we heard
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's about the parents let the parents
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
decide they know better
 
00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:51.430 align:start position:0%
decide they know better
finally

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
this isn't the first as some of the
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
written testimonies acknowledged which
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
you've read i'm sure
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
the manchester school board has a policy
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
now in place and i quote
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
the student has the right to be
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
addressed by a name or pronoun that
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
corresponds to students gender identity
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
folks this isn't rocket science or a
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
complex task
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
is a simple software update
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
and rewind that accordingly will improve
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
the culture in our public and charter

woodcock are there questions from the
 
00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:41.990 align:start position:0%
woodcock are there questions from the
representative

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.269 align:start position:0%
representative
cordelli

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
last year with uh house bill 1163
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh we had testimony from the department
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh in regard to the systems
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe it was uh stated that
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
there were approximately 15 different
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
software systems uh you know districts
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
and some additional homegrown systems
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to multiple major systems
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
within the department of education
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm just
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
wondering uh what is the basis
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
your prior statement that these are
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
simple uh software changes
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative cordelli for
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
the for the question
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
um going back to the exact testimonies
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
you discussed
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh the superintendents
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
in testimony last year that came to the
 
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.189 align:start position:0%
in testimony last year that came to the
education

00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
committee session in person
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
those that were from small systems said
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
they already do many workarounds for all
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
kinds of computer programs by their i.t
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
people at no cost
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
and there was one or two superintendents
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
there last year from larger municipal
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
systems that said because of the
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
contract of the language with their i.t
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
provider that if it is a law
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
then their i.t provider will make that
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh represent whitcock i have i have one
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
question uh i'm i looked up at your
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
mending language um
 
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.030 align:start position:0%
mending language um
and

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
the question i have is
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
regarding that
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
upon request from the parent or the
 
00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
upon request from the parent or the
guardian

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
if a student is 19 years old can the
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
student make that request
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
yes could they be considered an adult at
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay i just i was just looking for
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
clarification whereas it didn't say that
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
within within your um
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
well the guardian a parent wouldn't have
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
an obligation after 18
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
in the school the school has the student
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
has the right to self-designate after
 
00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:57.509 align:start position:0%
has the right to self-designate after
18.

00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
18.
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
i understand that thank you
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
further further questions of
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative whitcock
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
what if the system
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
um that we're talking about one of their
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
narrative systems has a field called sex
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
would the
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
definition of that field have to be
 
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.069 align:start position:0%
definition of that field have to be
changed

00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
to mean
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
if i and you're coming through uh poorly
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
it may be my computer representative
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
cordelia but if i understand the
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
question correctly you're asking if if
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
there is an additional field the navy's
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
negated uh
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the programming currently there are
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
two fields typically biological fields
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh male and female this would be a third
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
field and that would be the addition in
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
the uh software programming for the
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
questions for our representative
 
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.309 align:start position:0%
questions for our representative
woodcock

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing anything very much thank you
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair and members
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
of the committee for taking my testimony
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
today my name is sophia biandulilo i'm
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
14 i live in manchester
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking today on behalf of new
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire high school democrats in
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
support of hp 136.
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
hb 136 is a really simple bill that i
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
think will be very beneficial for
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
non-binary and gender non-conforming
 
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.430 align:start position:0%
non-binary and gender non-conforming
students

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
by allowing students to be properly
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
identified unofficial documentation in
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
school we promote understanding and
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
acceptance between teachers and students
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
and prevent bullying or other stressful
 
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.669 align:start position:0%
and prevent bullying or other stressful
experiences

00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
that might stem from a student being
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
improperly identified on their paperwork
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
i can't give any specific statistics on
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
how many non-binary students we have in
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but i can say that as a
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming student who has
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
many non-binary friends and is aware of
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
many more outside of those i know
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
personally there is definitely a
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
significant population within our
 
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.029 align:start position:0%
significant population within our
schools

00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
as for the financial implications of
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
this bill i think that due to the
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
simplicity of the change and the lack of
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note on the bill this will
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
probably have very little impact it
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
would just be a matter of adding one
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
more checkbox to a form or adding a new
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
option to a drop down
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
and if x versus gender is an issue that
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
would also just be a matter of changing
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
one word on an indicator
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
many institutions are already doing this
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
and we've seen the benefits to
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
non-binary people are great while the
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
cost is very very minimal
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
for all these reasons i think hp 136 is
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
a simple but very important bill that
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
would have great impact for non-binary
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
students and i asked the committee to
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
recommend auto-pass
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sophia are there
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
questions for sophia from
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh do we have uh
 
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:22.470 align:start position:0%
uh do we have uh
amendment

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
well we do have uh from the department
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
uh dianna
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh could you upload diana's participants
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
can you give one to ralph
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of noise coming
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
from somewhere
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's the people that are
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
in the lobby

and not hearing the people who are
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be talking sorry it probably
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
was me
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%

cordelli i couldn't understand half of
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:36.310 align:start position:0%
his uh testimony or
report

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
there are a couple people
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for having me
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
i'm actually uh playing the role of
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
caitlyn davis today so don't tell her
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
that i'm playing the role of caitlin
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
davis we'll just keep it a secret within
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
house education she'll never know um
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me caitlin was
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
unable to make it today
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of this bill obviously
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
the department does not take a position
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
for or against um but there would be a
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
financial implication of this bill we
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
would encourage there to be a fiscal
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
note on this um do we would have to
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
modify the student information system to
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
accommodate the
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
collection of of this new
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
area of non-binary
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
to do that we would have to pay a vendor
 
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.630 align:start position:0%
to do that we would have to pay a vendor
to

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
address the changes to the form
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
we would separately have to train
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
schools and staff
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
as to what this means how to implement
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
it how to collect this information how
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
to submit it to the department of ed
 
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.430 align:start position:0%
to submit it to the department of ed
um

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
we would also have to go through our
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
current laws and our rules uh a lot of
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
them are ambiguous as to gender or sex
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
they use the terms uh interchangeably we
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
would have to look to see where that
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
would need to be modified
 
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.789 align:start position:0%
would need to be modified
um

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
we would also have to work with all the
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
districts some of the districts would be
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
able to implement this uh their vendors
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
would pick this up would address this
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
change other schools would not so we
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
would have to spend some time working
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
with them ultimately just the need to
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
plan and modify that system
 
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
plan and modify that system
again

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
is it something the department
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
could do will do
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
if the legislation passes yes it is
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
but we would suggest that this bill have
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
a have a fiscal note to figure out how
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
this group would be reported out um
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
in its entirety i'm happy to take any
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%

that fields had to be changed in the
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
student information system
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%

i am not aware of that again that's not
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
an area that i work in on a daily basis
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
so let me do this let me
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%

has it probably happened in the past um
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
i would suspect it has but i i'm
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
hesitant to answer that question in the
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
affirmative so let me get that
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%

system student information system
 
00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:14.630 align:start position:0%
system student information system
and

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
i recall from other
 
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.390 align:start position:0%
i recall from other
legislation

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
that they're actually
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
four five six other major systems
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh especially if he comes to moss
 
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.549 align:start position:0%
uh especially if he comes to moss
those

00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
might also require update
 
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.669 align:start position:0%
might also require update
gravity

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli i i believe
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
you're corrected which is why we
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
referenced the
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
the idea that we would need to look at
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
our current laws and our current rules
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the other forms to see
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
how big this change uh will actually be
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of areas
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
where we would have to implement this
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
yes that is potentially the situation
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i did just get a
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
text message from miss davis to answer
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative mullen's questions
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
the answer is succinct it is yes we have
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
if you'd like any more detail than that
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative mom i'm happy to get you
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
that information as well
 
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.590 align:start position:0%
that information as well
uh

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
mr chair commissioner who respond to
 
00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:22.549 align:start position:0%
mr chair commissioner who respond to
that

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton thank you so much for
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
providing that information and if you
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind following up by asking for
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh an estimate on how much it cost that
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to do that thank you
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
and and if i may i think this is why a
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would be prudent on this
 
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.669 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would be prudent on this
bill

00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
is an attorney phantom
 
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.470 align:start position:0%
is an attorney phantom
sure

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.590 align:start position:0%
sure
enough

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
thanks very thanks very much mr chair
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
thanks very much attorney clinton um and
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
and unless you know the answer to to
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
this maybe this is another follow-up
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
request but the um the effective date on
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
136 in 60 days and um and obviously
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's from the time you know a law gets
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor but
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
i guess you know thinking practically
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
um you know we want to have things in
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
place at the start of the school year
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
would it be would it be practical would
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
it be possible for the department to

have things ready for the start of the
 
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
have things ready for the start of the

whether that's
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
july 1st 2021 or september 1st 2021 if
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
we could have some um i think guidance
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
from the from the department as to when
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
those software changes any other
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
policy changes or rule changes
 
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.830 align:start position:0%
policy changes or rule changes

[Music]
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
implemented and in place
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative luna thank you so much
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
for the question um i
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
actually meant to address that in my
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
testimony so i very much appreciate you
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
bringing that up
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
the effective date as it stands in the
 
00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:08.149 align:start position:0%
the effective date as it stands in the
bill

00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
would not be uh
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
workable for the department of ed we
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
would request at least a year in order
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
to implement these changes um these
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
changes are doable we have done these
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
similar changes in the past however i
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
think there it could have
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
wide reaching implications i think this
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
terminology that will have to be
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
addressed is in a lot of areas of the
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
work that the doe does
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
and we will have to work very carefully
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
with a vendor to implement these changes
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
we will have to work to change our forms
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
to train schools and to train staff
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's not to say we can't do it we just
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
have to recognize the lift that will be
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
on doe so again i appreciate the
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
question and i would request the um that
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
there be an amendment to reflect the
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
amount of work department would have to
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
do to
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
implement the terms of this bill and to
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
do it appropriately and not have it be
 
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.269 align:start position:0%
do it appropriately and not have it be
rushed

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
rushed
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much attorney
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh are there further questions from the
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
committee members for the doe
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%

good morning thank you thank you mr
 
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee my
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
name is jeannie herroska and i'm the
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
political director for the american
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
civil liberties union of new hampshire
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
testify today in support of hb 136.
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
all students deserve accurate and
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
affirming documentation including those
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
who do not identify as male or female
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
for students who are non-binary being
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
stuck with m or f gender marker on
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
school documents is discriminatory and
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
can result in bullying and harassment
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
this discrimination can in turn trigger
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
the distress of gender dysphoria
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
managing this risk of discrimination can
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
also lead many transgender and
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
non-binary students to avoid
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
participating fully in the school
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
setting altogether
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
schools should be affirming spaces where
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
students are encouraged to be their full
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
authentic selves
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're encouraged by the growing number
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire schools that have
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
adopted policies that specifically
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
affirm trans students with manchester
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
being just the latest
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
and we support hp136 because the right
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
of non-binary students to be affirmed
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
should not depend on which school they
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the legislature enacted sb 263
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
which provided public school students
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
with comprehensive non-discrimination
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
protections and implemented one of the
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations by the governor's
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
advisory council on diversity and
 
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.350 align:start position:0%
advisory council on diversity and
inclusion

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
inclusion
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
since the enactment of sb263
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
public schools are legally prohibited
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
from discriminating against a student on
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
the basis of gender identity
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
if a school is required and able to
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
correct their records for a student
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
whose gender identity is male or female
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
it must do the same for a student who is
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
gender non-binary the alternative is to
 
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
blatantly discriminate against a student
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
who is non-binary and to deny who they
 
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.870 align:start position:0%
who is non-binary and to deny who they
are

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
the notion that a person's identity is
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
not real because it is not binary
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
animates much of the discrimination that
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
non-binary people face
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
i i really listened closely to what the
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
department of education said
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
previously and i would just know
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
we believe that sb 263 quite frankly
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
necessitates this legislation and it's
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
concerning that there haven't been these
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
updates to software already to ensure
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with sb 263.
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
we were really proud of the legislature
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
when it enacted sb 263 a couple of years
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
ago and we strongly urge this committee
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
and this legislature to adopt hb 163 to
 
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.990 align:start position:0%
and this legislature to adopt hb 163 to
realize

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
realize
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
the non-discrimination protections in sb
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
263 and with that i'm happy to answer
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%

education committee members thank you
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
for for taking my my request to speak
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
i beg you to reject hb 136 or any law
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
that denies biological truths about boys
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
and girls
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
and teaches the lie that any child can
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
be born in the wrong body
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
my niece was a brilliant but troubled
 
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.869 align:start position:0%
my niece was a brilliant but troubled
woman

00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
woman
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
who has bounced from house to house as
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
she was growing up
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
although she never had any signs of
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria when she learned about
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
transgenderism she thought that would be
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
the end of her anxiety and her
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
depression and at first it seemed like
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
she was
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
when she announced that she was a boy
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
she became a local celebrity in her
 
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.550 align:start position:0%
she became a local celebrity in her
school

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
and the cross-sex hormones made her feel
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
good at first
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
but as she grew older
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
she didn't want to move ahead with
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
further surgeries and she realized she
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't have her old body back
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
she was stuck with post-secondary sexual
 
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.870 align:start position:0%
she was stuck with post-secondary sexual
characteristics

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
inclu including the the deep voice
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
she'd been talking about suicide and
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
then she died of an overdose shortly
 
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
then she died of an overdose shortly
before

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is happening all over the u.s
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
especially with young girls who have
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
trouble fitting in
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
girls on the autism spectrum and those
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
with anxiety disorders they're being
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
seduced by the the
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
trans craze and swept up by by
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
social media pure influence and
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
irreversibly damaged so please do all
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
you can to protect other young women by
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
rejecting any policy that forces other
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
people to pretend that a confused girl
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%

i'm also a new hampshire licensed
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%

and i'm here to testify in support of
hb136

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
hb136
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
um i just want to address a few things
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
that came up um so far in the hearing
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
um first of all i have not seen the
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
amended language so i want to put an
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
asterisk that my testimony is in
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
reference to the bill language that's
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
available online
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
um i want to echo a really important
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
point that representative woodcock made
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
earlier which is that schools are going
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
out of their way
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
to right now to make workarounds to to
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
accommodate the needs of students
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
and to comply with their own policies
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
and to comply with uh with with the law
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
that genie kruska just described um
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
which requires non-discrimination and
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
those workarounds are
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
time intensive they require a lot of
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
attention from school administrators
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
they require people like me to show up
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
and meet with and talk through issues
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
with people at schools and so the real
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
expense is there okay i also want to
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
address the question about whether uh
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction between sex and
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
gender and the bill language that i am
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with the terms sex or gender is
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
what appears in the in the language of
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
the bill and um
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
and i want to make i want to emphasize a
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
point which is that there's no legal
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
significance between or no legal
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
significantly significant difference
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
between the terms sex and gender they're
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
used interchangeably and they're also
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
used interchangeably outside of the
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
legal context including in schools and
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
on school documents you'll find school
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
documents that refer to sex and
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
documents that refer to gender and
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
they're used interchangeably all right
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
also i want to take just a quick moment
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
to provide a little bit of a framework
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
for talking about who non-binary people
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
are because the terms unfamiliar to many
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
people the legal framework for talking
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
about non-very non-binary people is even
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
less familiar
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
so let's start with the more familiar
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
concept of transgender people
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
transgender people are people who are
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
assigned who's assigned sex or natal sex
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't match their gender identity and
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
virtually everyone is assigned to sex at
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
birth either male or female
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
and um for for uh for people who are who
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
who are transgender those don't line up
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't line up with their
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
gender identity and some people
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
experience a health condition known as
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria so gender dysphoria is
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
a condition it's a serious health
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
condition it's recognized by the dsm-5
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
and it's defined as clinically
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
significant distress caused by the
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
mismatch between your assigned sex and
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
your gender identity so in other words
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
people who experience the health code
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
condition known as gender dysphoria are
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
generally speaking transgender people uh
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
and fortunately uh although gender
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
dysphoria is a very medical condition
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's also really highly treatable every
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
major medical association agrees on this
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
point everyone that the only appropriate
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
treatment for gender dysphoria is gender
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
transition so in other words
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
transitioning to live consistent with
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
your gender identity that's the only
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
treatment for the serious medical
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
condition known as gender dysphoria okay
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
and treatment is highly individualized
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
it involves any combination of different
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
treatment options for how a person
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
transitions but when we're talking about
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
children we're talking about social
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
transition okay
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
social transition and it's medical
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
treatment that that that that enables a
 
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
person to live in their day-to-day lives
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with their gender identity
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay and that inc includes going to
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
school and being recognized as your
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
authentic self but it also involves
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
something i like to refer to as legal
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
transition which means updating identity
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
documents and having you know
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
recognition that your name and the
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
pronouns that you use and the markers on
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
your identification documents are all
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with your gender identity
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
so um we typically think of transgender
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
people as transitioning from male to
 
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
female or from female to male but um as
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
we know there are other people who
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
experience gender dysphoria whose gender
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
identity is neither male nor female and
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
so the blanket term that we use to
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
describe these people is non-binary
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
so having set that stage i just want to
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
remind everybody uh you know this has
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
already been stated but just two
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
sessions ago new hampshire enacted a
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive non-discrimination statute
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
that applies to all public schools
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
and the statute um includes protections
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
on the basis of race religion sex and
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
gender identity um
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
and among other things that law um
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
applies uh to prohibit discrimination
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
against non-binary students too because
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's their gender identity
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
also in 2019 another bill became law
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
that established the right for new
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents to obtain
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
identification cards and driver's
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
license that indicated gender other than
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
male and female so an x marker on new
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire identification forms indicates
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
that a person under the consultation of
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
a medical care provider has transitioned
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
to a gender identity that's outside the
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
traditional male female binary when you
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
take these laws together
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
it just leads to inescapable conclusion
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire public schools must
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
also recognize that some students have a
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
non-gender or non-binary gender identity
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
but new hampshire schools have already
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
gone further you know about half of new
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire students are already covered
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
under school district policies that
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
protect them from gender identity
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination in many cases explicitly
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
recognizing that some students are
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
non-binary or another term gender
 
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.309 align:start position:0%
non-binary or another term gender
non-conforming

00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
non-conforming
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
universally nearly all of us agree on
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
all of us and everyone here on this
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee and everybody listening agree
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
on one important point which is that
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
every new hampshire public school
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
student must be granted equal education
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities and that's true regardless
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
of their gender identity and i know that
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
i know i know that equality is a really
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
important priority for every single
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
member of this committee
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
so non-binary students like all students
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
they must be affirmed in their gender
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
identity it's not just the decent thing
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
to do or the right thing to do it's also
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
the medically appropriate and medically
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
necessary thing to do
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
any medical care provider is going to
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
who's who's competent and respected is
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
going to tell you the same thing that
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
young people must be affirmed in their
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
gender identity this is true for
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
transgender students it's true for
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
non-binary students it's true for gender
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
non-conforming students
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
so hb 136 brings us closer to that goal
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it's a very simple and
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward manner it's not overly
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
prescriptive it simply directs school
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
software and paperwork to provide a
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
gender marker for students who identify
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
neither as exclusively male nor is
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
exclusively female and the schools can
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
take it from there uh and so can the
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
vendors frankly it's it's the
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the vendors that the
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
school contracts with to accommodate the
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
needs of the students that they serve
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is simple it causes no harm
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
to anybody
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
and it might mean a world of difference
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
to the health safety and well-being of
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
the students whose gender identity is
 
00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:45.829 align:start position:0%
the students whose gender identity is
non-binary

00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
non-binary
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
schools already have this obligation to
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
treat non-binary students with respect
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
to treat them equally to be trained to
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
do so those obligations already exist
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
and this law doesn't change any of that
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's no justification for voting
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
against this bill and i strongly urge
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
everyone in the committee to vote ought
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
chris are there
 
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.589 align:start position:0%
chris are there
questions

00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you ms chairman um
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
gender markers gender identities
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we've had testimony
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the past and other legislation
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
as to the
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
different identities to which people
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
might identify
 
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.670 align:start position:0%
might identify
is

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
if we were making a software change is
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
there a a list
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
of valid identities
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
that um would be
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh put into a computer database that is
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
would that just be a one-digit code or
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
how would that how would that work do
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
you think
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
oh so i think that's a really important
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for raising it um
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
people's gender identities are any
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
number of things that people can
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
identify in any multitude of ways and uh
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
in fact um in fact language is
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
constantly evolving and changing so to
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
answer your question no none of that is
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
necessary it's not necessary to
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
accommodate every conceivable way that a
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
person might identify themselves what's
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
important is to recognize that some
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
students most students identify as male
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
or female and then some students don't
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
and those students deserve to
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to like have have recognition
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
of the fact that their gender identity
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
isn't encompassed by that male or female
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
binary as
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
conventions change and language evolves
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's there's no reason to
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
imagine that we need to identify every
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
single student exactly with the marker
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
that they identify as because we just
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
need to understand that not all students
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
identify as male or female what this
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill does is it says that there's male
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
gender students there's female gendered
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
students and then there are students who
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
are not either that's all
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
our current partner representative
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you attorney
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
rachel for taking my question
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh as you're probably aware there is
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
also de-transition and re-transition and
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
some youngsters
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
their identity changes uh
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
even if they're already binary so my
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
question is as you look at this
 
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.309 align:start position:0%
question is as you look at this
legislation

00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:46:30.319 --> 00:46:31.510 align:start position:0%
legislation
uh

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
if if the software is put in place would
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
it accommodate
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
a youngster who undergoes retransition
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to answer that by well first
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
just i want to say that you know that
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
you bring up the term detransition that
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
that that term actually applies to a
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
very very small number of people who go
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
through a medical transition and then uh
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
decide later that that is uh that that
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
is not what works for them in their
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
lives and in many cases the reason that
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
those people usually adults decide to
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
detransition is because they experience
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
great discrimination great levels of
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination as most transgender
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
people do uh operating in the day-to-day
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
world and therefore you know uh decide
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
that what's best for them is to
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
detransition and for those people they
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
have every right to do that but that has
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with what we're talking
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
about here what we're talking about here
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
is acknowledging students
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
based on how they identify with the
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
gender marker and if your question is
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
whether a student might change from m to
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
f and then to x
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the future uh yes that is something
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
that could possibly happen is that
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
disruptive or does that uh you know
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
interfere with the way school systems
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
operate no it doesn't this is a very
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
simple way to accommodate students who
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
are uh you know at an age when they're
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
learning to understand their gender
 
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.309 align:start position:0%
learning to understand their gender
identity

00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
identity
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
questions of mr herschel
 
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chris
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
my name is susan stearns and i'm the
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
deputy director for nami new hampshire
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
the national alliance on mental illness
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm actually here in the place of our
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
executive director ken norton who was
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
called away
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of nami new hampshire i am
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of house bill 136
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
while i think many of us may feel of a
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
certain age many of us may feel that
 
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.510 align:start position:0%
certain age many of us may feel that
the

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.710 align:start position:0%
the
visibility

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
visibility
 
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.829 align:start position:0%
visibility
of

00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
this variety across the gender spectrum
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
seems relatively recent in our lives
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
what we really are seeing is that the
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
acceptance and the willingness for folks
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
especially young people to disclose that
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
variety on the gender spectrum is what
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
has changed it's not that that gender
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
spectrum didn't exist previously but
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
that acceptance is starting to come into
 
00:49:16.319 --> 00:49:17.430 align:start position:0%
that acceptance is starting to come into
being

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
however even as we have greater numbers
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
of people who are disclosing their true
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the challenges that
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
many of our young transgender and
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
non-binary folks go through
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
um many youths who are transgender or
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
are non-binary are rejected um even by
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
the their immediate family
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
they are often bullied at school as we
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
have heard
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
and there is an alarming increase
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
of violence in our society against
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
transgender and gender non-conforming
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
individuals in recent years
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
oppression and lack of acceptance for
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
many of these young folks they are
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
indeed at greater risk of suicidal
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts and actions
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
research indicates
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
transgender people are twice as likely
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
to think about or attempt suicide than
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who identify with the sex
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
they were assigned at birth
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
one 2018 study by the american academy
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
of pediatric found an increased risk
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
level in transgender and non-binary roof
 
00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.190 align:start position:0%
level in transgender and non-binary roof
youth

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
youth
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
that found the highest rates for
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide were by transgender
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
men in non-binary youth at 50.8 percent
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
and 41.8
 
00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.470 align:start position:0%
and 41.8
respectively

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
while these statistics are disturbing
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's very important to note
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
that there are very simple things that
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
can be done to reduce these high
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
percentages and improve overall health
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
and well-being for these young folks one
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
of them are endeavors like house bill
 
00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:59.510 align:start position:0%
of them are endeavors like house bill
136

00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
136
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
there was a study performed at the
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
university of
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
texas at austin that found that when
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
transgender and gender non-conforming
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
youth were able to use their chosen name
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
the name they chose to identify identify
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
their true gender their risk of mental
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
health conditions and suicide decreases
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
in fact this study found that amongst
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
these youths who were able to use their
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
chosen name they experienced 71
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
fewer symptoms of severe depression a 34
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
decrease in suicidal ideation and a 65
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
percent decrease in suicide attempts
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
as the mother of a now
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
adult non-binary individual who once sat
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
in an icu
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
next to them after a suicide attempt
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you how it heartens me to
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
hear such simple things
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
might prevent another mother from having
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
to experience the same
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
so if the simple act of allowing someone
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
to use their chosen name can reflect the
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
drastic improvement in mental health
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
maturely their ability to disclose the
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
gender identity on official documents
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
can make much the same impact we as
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
we've heard new hampshire now allows you
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
to do that on your driver's license and
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
efficient identification
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
surely schools where our children spend
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
the bulk of their time or
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
once this pandemic is over over we hope
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
they're back to spending the bulk of
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
their time
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
um is an important place for them to be
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
able to identify um as non-binary
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
transgender as their true authentic
 
00:52:34.079 --> 00:52:36.150 align:start position:0%
transgender as their true authentic
selves

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
selves
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
to a transgender or gender
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
non-conforming person the reflection of
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
their gender on official documents
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
and their
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
places can play a significant role in
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
their self-esteem and their emotional
 
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.829 align:start position:0%
their self-esteem and their emotional
well-being

00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
i've been informed that
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh for us to gather a fiscal note and
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
we've been encouraged to do so by the
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
we need to have a committee
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
vote to do so requiring the lba to
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
get that fiscal note from the department
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
of education and if this is uh quoting
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%

we take
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
a vote right now today
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
or we can delay it and and if we wanted
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
this to know which i believe we should
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of what uh attorney bentley
 
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
was uh suggesting
 
00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
we could have a motion to
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
direct uh to request
 
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.349 align:start position:0%
direct uh to request
a

00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal in the lba
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's open to the committee now to
 
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.270 align:start position:0%
that's open to the committee now to
discuss

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh i will not discuss it too long but uh
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
because we have number bills but uh
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works uh rex on luna
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
is that hand up or down yeah no it's up
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's a parliamentary
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry of the chair
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.829 align:start position:0%
inquiry of the chair
um

00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
so thanks very much mr chair just
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
wondering what what the request of a
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would mean in terms of
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
um the status of um of
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
136 and given the fact that some house
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
deadlines have already come and passed
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
um if if um requesting a fiscal note now
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
would uh would somehow imperil um this
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
bill going forward
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that it most likely
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
would not sing what mr woodcock rexella
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
would talk as mentioned that if there is
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
a cost factor it's probably very
 
00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.710 align:start position:0%
a cost factor it's probably very
insignificant

00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
insignificant
 
00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.829 align:start position:0%
insignificant
however

00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:00.789 align:start position:0%
however
um

00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
i think that that it will be determined
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
if we can get something from uh
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
caitlin davis as quickly as possible uh
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
i i can't see any reason why it should
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
not take long and we have a deadline for
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
these bills which has been extended to
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
get bills out
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
so if we get that back
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
we can uh
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
have that brought back to our attention
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
have it available for an executive
 
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.309 align:start position:0%
have it available for an executive
session

00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up on that mr chair um
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
just just to be completely clear um and
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
and you know i'm i'm
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the of the mindset here that that
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
let's get started on this now
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
um knowing that it's going to take a
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
little bit that it could take a little
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
bit of time to do i wouldn't want to see
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
in any way derailed uh procedurally so
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
should we get confirmation from the
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
clerk or the speaker's office that
 
00:56:58.559 --> 00:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
clerk or the speaker's office that
that

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
getting a getting a fiscal note would
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
not create um
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
well to respond to that to that dave um
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
i i've just been informed by the lba
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
that wanted for them to do something
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
they have to have the committee
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
recommending that it be done seeing that
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's gone forward
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
out of committee yet
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that you know once uh
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
the next bill i have to testify 182 but
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
upon that i will immediately call
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
um the lba saying we have this committee
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
vote i'd like to have it sent directly
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
over to kingdom davis and having them
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
start working on it so we that gives us
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks here
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
what's the date we have to have these
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
things done by
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know april 1st
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
so april 1st is a deadline to get that
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
in i believe that it can be done and i
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
will encourage them to do so seeing that
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
this bill i i understand the need
 
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.270 align:start position:0%
this bill i i understand the need
um

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
so i i guess that's all i can assure you
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
on right now
 
00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.069 align:start position:0%
on right now
okay

00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much rick mr chair a
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
point of
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
point of uh inquiry
 
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.309 align:start position:0%
point of uh inquiry
please

00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.319 --> 00:58:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
we've had other
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
really big bills come through
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
that have had no physical note to them
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
have nothing filled in
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the information that we were told
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
was that it would just go on to the
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
physical committee as a second committee
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
and could be decided there
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering why all of a sudden
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
we have a bill
 
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:45.670 align:start position:0%
we have a bill
that

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
we need a definite number for why
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
why can't this just go through as
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
needing a fiscal note and let the
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
physical committee do it i mean i i
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
don't understand that well for one we've
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
gone by that early date we did uh
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
request fiscal notes on there was one
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill which we had on the added cost of
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy and as a result of getting that
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
late when we did get the fiscal note it
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
didn't work and that's why
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh it didn't go forward um i
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
recognized that it should have had a
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note most likely
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
and but it doesn't but now it's not
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
going to go into fiscal seeing that
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
those those issues are already been
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
dropped on their doorstep um i think
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
that if it comes back that this will
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
notify light which i it to be then we
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
can move forward and bills like that
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
where they're it's not a heavy duty
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
pistol no oftentimes not even set to uh
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
so that that's where we stand on it
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.109 align:start position:0%
right now
so

00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
so thanks um so information that that um
 
01:00:01.359 --> 01:00:02.150 align:start position:0%
so thanks um so information that that um
that

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
i received
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
from from caitlin
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
davis back in september of 2020 and this
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
was specific to house bill 1163
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
which is which the same subject of of
 
01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.109 align:start position:0%
which is which the same subject of of
this

01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
ms davis estimates that it would take
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
around 20 000
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
um worth of contractor hours to update
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
the data collection reporting
 
01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.950 align:start position:0%
the data collection reporting
warehousing

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
warehousing
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
um systems at the um at the department
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that the um that the costs to um
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
to school districts
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
would uh would would really be de
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
minimis because um if the state requires
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
it then they will update the system free
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
of charge so that's the student
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
information systems on there i'm just
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if um if if maybe there's no
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the um you know the relative
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
financial impact uh i mean i think we've
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
heard that below a certain bar
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
um the lba just doesn't doesn't do
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes and would it be sufficient
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
to to maybe get this information for the
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee to get this information
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
directly from ms davis since we know
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
they rely on the department for drafting
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
the notes
 
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.910 align:start position:0%
the notes
um

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't so that so it
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
basically becomes information from the
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
department on the cost impact
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
um of this and this committee can make
 
01:01:26.799 --> 01:01:27.750 align:start position:0%
um of this and this committee can make
um

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know can look at that uh when it
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
comes to executive session rather than
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
this bill being retitled and retitled
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
within with an fn and um and potentially
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
having to go to a
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
a second committee um
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.589 align:start position:0%
we
uh

01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
we can do that we can go right to
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
caitlin and we've done that before
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
however when it comes time where there's
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
been a recommendation and the
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation was made by department of
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
education in this hearing
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
we can get that fiscal note rapidly
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
but we're not and lba will not accept uh
 
01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
a fiscal analysis based upon what we get
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
from doe it's gonna unfortunately it's
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
gonna go true lba and provide it to us
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
that could be done quickly it's just i
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
offered that as an option here and to
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
expedite the bill um if we delay today's
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
work you know we're just slowing it down
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
i cannot i cannot request a uh
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
lba fiscal note
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh until we have gone through the formal
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
voting on it to request that as a total
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
commitment that's according to that rsa
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we were told already today
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
by lba
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
no i i get that mr chair i'm just
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
suggesting whether that's really really
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
necessary and if there's an alternative
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
more expeditious path giving the um the
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
the the twenty thousand dollar estimate
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that i have in writing from miss davis
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know and the no cost to school
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
districts that that that would be a
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
better way to um a more
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
expeditious way to uh to proceed that's
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh represent
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
your handout yes i do mr chair thank you
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
for taking um
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
my uh question
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis the department of
 
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.390 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis the department of
education

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
normally has to do updates just based on
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
any number of things
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
it just seems a little bit unfair to
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
attach um one particular thing to a
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
separate fiscal note
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
in order to update a system
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
that usually
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
because of legislation passed during a
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
session year
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
they have to update anyway so it would
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
be my thought that this would just be
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
part of the usual and customary updates
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
that the department of education
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
normally has to do in the course of
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
doing business with the new hampshire
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
legislature thank you for taking my
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
question cornell thank you
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
looking back on my notes
 
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.430 align:start position:0%
looking back on my notes
house on

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
house on
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
1163 last year
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
um the department also suggested that a
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note be obtained and we had the
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
same recommendation uh just today
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
so uh i think that that is the uh
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
proper way to proceed and all it takes
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
is a committee vote and request to the
 
01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.430 align:start position:0%
is a committee vote and request to the
lba

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%

uh thank you i just wondered if uh
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
represent our attorney fenton is still
 
01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:35.670 align:start position:0%
represent our attorney fenton is still
here

here
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
she does
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to ask her a question if i
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
could about this
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead i think she's there
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
okay um we passed a bill that became law
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh 193 colon 38 that um
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
is a non-discrimination law
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh affecting public schools
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
i'm on some level i just i was just
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
thinking i'm surprised that
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
didn't uh when that bill came through
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh and became law didn't actually update
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
their systems then i i uh heard uh
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative heath say that they they
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
update the systems regularly and it
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that they would have
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
done that
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
at that time uh
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
do you have any information about that
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so thank you for the question
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm somewhat limited in information
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
because i am just testifying on behalf
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
of uh caitlyn davis as you know
 
01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:48.150 align:start position:0%
of uh caitlyn davis as you know
um

01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if we
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
do updates to our system
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
every year uh what i can tell you is
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
we anticipate because we simply don't
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
have the software we would have to
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
contract with the vendor now we've done
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
that in other instances we would do that
 
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.390 align:start position:0%
that in other instances we would do that
um

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
in in this case if need be um i i'm not
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
sure representative tanner i missed part
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
of your question when i was being
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
updated to a panelist i'm not sure what
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
law you were referring to
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
if you could just repeat that sure uh
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
193 colon 38 it was uh went into law we
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
passed the bill
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh last term and um
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
it describes non-discrimination in
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
public schools and uh this bill
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know is just kind of a follow-up
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
with parents requests um i would have
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
thought that the state department of
 
01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:45.269 align:start position:0%
thought that the state department of
education

01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
would have updated their software
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh in response to a non-discrimination
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill like that um just just to protect
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
themselves from possible lawsuits
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if we had any
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
information about whether they had or
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
had not thank you
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and the
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
clarification to the best of my
 
01:09:04.239 --> 01:09:05.709 align:start position:0%
clarification to the best of my
knowledge

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
19338 did not require an update to our
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
systems i will double check on that to
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that i'm accurate in that
 
01:09:13.199 --> 01:09:14.390 align:start position:0%
make sure that i'm accurate in that
response

01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
um it was in speaking with caitlin davis
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
she's the one who recommended that there
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
be a fiscal note just so we can really
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
flush out what this would look like
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
that suggestion came directly from her
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
and again i just want to reiterate we
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
have updated our
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
systems before we will continue to do so
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's done annually but
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
certainly uh representative heath is
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
correct when there's legislative change
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly take that on um the
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
information i just wanted to convey to
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
the committee today was that we would
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
have to um
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
work with a vendor and and pay that
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
vendor to make those changes and to just
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
be cognizant that there would be other
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal implications just in terms of
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
training schools and staff
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay um further discussion from
 
01:10:08.239 --> 01:10:10.709 align:start position:0%
okay um further discussion from
representative

01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair this is a question
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
to um representative
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative to attorney fenton um
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton so
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
if the department is in the practice of
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
updating uh software and training on any
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that come out
 
01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.950 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that come out
um

01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
has this issue ever been raised in the
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
past the cost of updating the software
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
i mean i i've been around for a few
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
years now and i i don't remember uh
 
01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:46.070 align:start position:0%
years now and i i don't remember uh
addressing

01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
the cost of updating the software of the
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
department based on any legislation
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
it is always a concern for the
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
department in terms of us being aware of
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
what impact it will have on
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
on us internally it might be something
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we have become more aware of in
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
current years moving forward recognizing
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
that some of these changes do require
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
significant um undertakings um
 
01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.270 align:start position:0%
significant um undertakings um
so

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know internally it's something that
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
we have talked about representative
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
mullen does it always equate to a fiscal
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
note perhaps not that might just be more
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
of a best practices that we've
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
undertaken um
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
recently because sometimes what happens
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
is we will not and i'm not talking about
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
this bill in particular but in general
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
once the laws um are passed we then have
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to say oh okay what is
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
this going to require for the department
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
to do to effectuate this bill and as a
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
best practice we are now trying to
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
address those
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
earlier in the process
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
and identify what it will take um i will
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
just refer back to representative luna's
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
question of the effective date and
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that um again not in
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
this bill but in other bills has caught
 
01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:11.430 align:start position:0%
this bill but in other bills has caught
us

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes to say gosh we need a longer
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
period of time a longer runway if you
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
will to implement this bill and so these
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
are some things the department is trying
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
to be more proactive on
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
identifying some issues as the
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislation works its way through the
 
01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.470 align:start position:0%
legislation works its way through the
system

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
to to say you know what we're going to
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
need more funding more support more time
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
here so that at the end we can implement

so basically what i'm going to do is um
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm supposed to take the positive on
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
that and the positive would be to seek
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent options yeah i was
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering who requested that this
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
one up in the first place i mean we
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
so what what was the vote on that
 
01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.790 align:start position:0%
so what what was the vote on that
1010.

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
1010.
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
motion fails 10 10 so motion fails
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
thai vote motion fails wow
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay so we will not see a
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.199 --> 01:16:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is oliver ford i didn't get to vote
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't know whether it's something
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
to do with my computer or what
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
you're not visible
 
01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.630 align:start position:0%
you're not visible
yes

01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
i can't i'm having trouble with my
 
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.709 align:start position:0%
i can't i'm having trouble with my
computer

01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
computer
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
and i suspect that somehow not having my
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
picture on the screen means i don't get
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
what was your name sir i
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
understood an answer of yes
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
he's correct
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
voted yes yes but that that will count
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
because you cannot see his image
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
right he's not serious i can see all of
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
you but you can't see me and i don't

01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
email if you check that and try to

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%

which everybody should be in possession
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
of it's
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
0-6-9-0-8 and i will speak to that
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
amendment uh in the amendment if you're
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
approval of courses and programs
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
the principal or other administrator of
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
a high school shall grant credit toward
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
graduation and that's read initially
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
for courses and programs completed at
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
other approved schools
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
the changes to that language
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh reads as follows the principal or
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
other administrator of a high school
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
shall grant credit toward high school
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
graduation for similar courses
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
and programs that have been
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily completed at other
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
approved schools or shall provide
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable justification for denial
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
that particular language those changes
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
is an exact replication
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
of what we have for students under the
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
military compact which we have
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
rsa 110
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
dash d colon eight
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh roman one
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
that language is exactly as it stands
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
there uh i did not include any of the
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
other language where they can be
 
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
other language where they can be
appealed

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
appealed
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
or that it can be then you can have some
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
other kind of an assessment as we had in
 
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
previous years this simply says
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
that if it's
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
denied then uh reasonable justification
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the denial shall be provided
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's the only change to the bill
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
and for purposes of this section
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
approved schools include all new
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire public schools charter public
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
schools public academies approved public
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
or private tuition program schools in
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
all schools in vermont maine that are
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
members of the interstate school
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
district with schools in new hampshire
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
in other words the interstate compacts
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
which we have
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to conclude my presentation
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
because we are in a
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
time frame here
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
i think most of us are all familiar with
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
this language and the
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill from previous years
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
and and the changes come from current
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
statute for children of military
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%

and thank you representative for taking
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
would this include the bill include
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
programs courses
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it says that complete and completed
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
at other approved schools
 
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.070 align:start position:0%
at other approved schools

01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
um those courses as i see it are not a
 
01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.669 align:start position:0%
um those courses as i see it are not a
school

01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:44.709 align:start position:0%
school
okay

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
okay

thank you welcome

i do not see any other obsidian
representative

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you um
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
um just looking at this bill and based
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
on what you just said
 
01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.750 align:start position:0%
on what you just said
does

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
the principal of the school retain the
 
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.910 align:start position:0%
the principal of the school retain the
right

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
to deny
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
credit award
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
and my understanding from what you just
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
said that if in fact
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
the student does not agree they have the
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
right to appeal
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
does this change
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
allow the local school district to
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
retain their authority
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
is my question
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay um the appeal process that we had
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
in previous years is gone
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
what this does it basically says and
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what it says in the
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
military contract for kids for millions
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
that have been in eod schools or some
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
other location
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
that if the course is similar to a
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
course that's available that should help
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
the principal or that principal's design
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
to determine whether they're going to
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
give credit towards graduation based
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
upon the course we offer in the
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
receiving school
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
if you decide that it's not it does not
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily complete
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
what you have identified as your program
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
in your high school then it can be
 
01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.149 align:start position:0%
in your high school then it can be
denied

01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't say there's any appeal
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
process it shall provide reasonable
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
justification for denial in other words
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
to explain in the in this course in juta
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
it did not contain this this this and
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
this and that's something we have
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
reached in our course here
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
and or it might be that the principle or
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
designate provides some kind of
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
assessment they don't have to do that
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
and the child doesn't you know
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
achieve competency there's another
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
and that's reasonable
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
um could i just have a yes or no answer
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
with regard to the retention of the
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
authority of the local school district
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
over the awarding of credits is it a yes
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
or no
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
the the yes is for the school district
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
to determine whether they're going to
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
accept it or not accepted
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:08.639 --> 01:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative cordelli and
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ladd for taking
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
my my question
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
um my question
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
this time around is the same as it was
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
the last time we dealt with this bill
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
different schools and different
 
01:23:31.199 --> 01:23:32.629 align:start position:0%
different schools and different
personnel

01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
define the word program
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
in specific ways
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if you can
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
tighten for me the understanding of
 
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
tighten for me the understanding of
what

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
this bill considers a program to be
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
is it a credit bearing program
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
or um i just i i
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
i feel like it's a little ambiguous and
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what the definition of the
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
word program
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
is some programs are terms which are
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
used in the military compact as well
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
so we would be using the same
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
definitions that they use and
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
programs we know there's programs
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that are provided to protect
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
implementation systems
 
01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.390 align:start position:0%
implementation systems
there

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
we have programs built into our advocacy
 
01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.310 align:start position:0%
we have programs built into our advocacy
law

01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
it would be basically the same
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
definition that exists in statute now
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
hey uh president tanner
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
i was wondering
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
because i'm not that super familiar with
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
the military code
 
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.430 align:start position:0%
the military code
when

01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
under their code do they accept
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh programs and credits from well it
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be credits but from schools for
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
tuition only
 
01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.790 align:start position:0%
tuition only
um

01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
schools that don't have uh a formal
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
graduation or
 
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.709 align:start position:0%
graduation or
uh

01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
aren't accredited do they accept from
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little bit lost in your
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
question in here uh the
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
for those of us which were here
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
years ago when the military compact was
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
put together this is the same used in 50
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
states across the country it's uh
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's common for those that have the kids
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
in independent schools or or the kids
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
are in a school that could be a public
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
school in the location where their their
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
mom or dad is in the military it could
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
be in europe someplace or africa in some
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
place and they transfer often and this
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
is trying to facilitate so kids don't
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
graduation credit or don't lose the time
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise you don't want to see kids in
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
school having to make up a whole year so
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
this is a a process which has been in
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
place for years across this country just
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get a similar process in place
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
for kids of non-military parents
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh basically
 
01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.229 align:start position:0%
uh basically
uh

01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
who does the military accept credit
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
accept credits or programs from is it is
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
you said that they
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
public schools public academies approve
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
public or private tuition program
 
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.870 align:start position:0%
public or private tuition program
schools

01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
and um as far as i understand
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
in in new hampshire uh we have we have
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
schools that are approved
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
that are for attendance only um and they
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
really don't have standards or approved
 
01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.110 align:start position:0%
really don't have standards or approved
programs

01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
and and we're also dealing with
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
competency based assessments so
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering about the transfer
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
from that whether the military accepts
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh programs from
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
from those types of schools it seems
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
like the department of education and the
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
military uh is pretty strict about their
 
01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.550 align:start position:0%
military uh is pretty strict about their
standards

01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
their education system is is very good
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
yes i'm aware it is not well i was in a
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
state which uh
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
at one point in time 50 percent of the
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
people living there were in the military
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
um and so we had a lot of transiency
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
amongst uh students uh many of the
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
students there attended public schools
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
within the community
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
that were approved by that state
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
department our fight
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
by the the local municipality in the
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
state in which they live so this
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
the standards which we have set up for
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
charter public schools public academies
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
approved public and private tuition
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
program schools
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
and agreements with vermont maine those
 
01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.310 align:start position:0%
and agreements with vermont maine those
same

01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
standards that we have for these
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
receiving schools
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
would i would imagine being required of
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
the school that's sending to these
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
schools and if they're not then that
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
gives pause for the principal to say i'm
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
not going to accept that course
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you a representative jeff
 
01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
okay thank you a representative jeff
question

01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman thank you uh
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
i'm getting a sense that we're drifting
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
a bit here because the military compact
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
refers to the children dependent
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
children of military service members as
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
they move from state to state local to
 
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.990 align:start position:0%
they move from state to state local to
locale

01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
locale
 
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.430 align:start position:0%
locale
not

01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
not relating to the military and the
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
acceptance of credits for military
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.390 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking that question
 
01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.669 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking that question
so

01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
in our high
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
school we
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
students were able to take advantage of
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
extended learning opportunities from
 
01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:01.990 align:start position:0%
extended learning opportunities from
plos

01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
plos
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
you could get credit on outside
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
experiences we would put together like a
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
little portfolio and it will be reviewed
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
by the school and you can get school
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
credit for that
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
similar to what you're referring to
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
if it's approved by the administrator in
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
the facility that you're talking about
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
and they've gone through this match that
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
up with the standards that they require
 
01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.510 align:start position:0%
up with the standards that they require
for

01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
for that particular course
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
see no other question follow up regular
 
01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.709 align:start position:0%
see no other question follow up regular
delay

01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
delay
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
last minute
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
01:29:42.719 --> 01:29:43.910 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
uh

01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm new to the committee obviously so i
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the deep background everybody
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
else does but um
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
precisely what problem current problem
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
is this bill addressing because
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
everything i'm hearing is that i am not
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
hearing any evidence that there is any
 
01:29:58.639 --> 01:30:00.310 align:start position:0%
hearing any evidence that there is any
problem

01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
with the current system as it exists
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
so what problem is this addressing
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
well i can give you a personal
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
a situation that i experienced with my
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
own kid
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
i moved from one state to another state
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
he took us
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
an accredited school in the state of
 
01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.990 align:start position:0%
an accredited school in the state of
maine

01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the city of rompers maine
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
when he moved to the district that i was
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
in and of course the accrediting
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
organization there was the northwest
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
association of schools and colleges
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
but because he took it as a freshman
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
and they offered it as he had another
 
01:30:43.199 --> 01:30:44.229 align:start position:0%
and they offered it as he had another
level

01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh and which was the sophomore and he
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
came in as a sophomore and didn't want
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
to have to take the us history course
 
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.149 align:start position:0%
to have to take the us history course
again

01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
they made him do so they would not
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
accept that credit that he had from the
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
ascending school which was for
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
basically when i looked at the syllabus
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
for both locations almost exactly the
 
01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
for both locations almost exactly the
same

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't in their their sequence in
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
which they taught
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
and they were basically looking to fill
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you just a follow-up on that um
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the one personal
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
experience do you have any other wider
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
evidence of a problem
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
we do know that there's been situations
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
in this state where you think of course
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
you'd be
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
not been accepted by the receiving
 
01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:32.870 align:start position:0%
not been accepted by the receiving
school

01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
and is that currently in the power of
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
the local district to make that decision
 
01:31:38.239 --> 01:31:39.510 align:start position:0%
the local district to make that decision
yes

01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
and what does this change then this bill
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
it would give more thrust to saying why
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
was this course denied why was it from
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
the virtual learning academy that's
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
approved school in our state here
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
and you're you're now transferring to
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
community x why are you rejecting this
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
mr mr principal or does it mean
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
so the only change then would be that it
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
is simply asking the principal or
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
designee to offer an explanation
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the rejection that is the only
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
change being contemplated here
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
also got what the military has placed in
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
it similar courses and these similar
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
courses that vlax has they match the
 
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
standards which we have for this state
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
in certain subject areas uh i would
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
think that would cause themselves if it
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
were saying that's
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
there's not a justifiable reason for
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
rejecting that force
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
one final thing um
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
we seem to be referring constantly back
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the military compact but i have no
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of that
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and no familiarity with it
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and it strikes me that many
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee do not should
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
we not then examine that military
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
compact and all the uh details and uh
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
possible um uh implications of that um
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
before we go ahead with this bill since
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
we seem to be relying upon that a great
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so uh
 
01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so uh
if

01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.310 align:start position:0%
if
if

01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
in this case um
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
somebody takes a vlax course
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the local principal
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
denies the credit for that particular
 
01:33:24.719 --> 01:33:25.669 align:start position:0%
denies the credit for that particular
course

01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:33:25.679 --> 01:33:27.350 align:start position:0%
course
um

01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the procedure
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
the the principal uh then or the the
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
person in charge maybe a superintendent
 
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.709 align:start position:0%
person in charge maybe a superintendent
um

01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
makes a reasonable justification who
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
who judy gate adjudicates
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh whether that is reasonable
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
who makes the final decision on
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
this the principal made that final
 
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.390 align:start position:0%
this the principal made that final
decision

01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me i didn't hear it i'm sorry
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that there is no course for
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
to get it adjudicated if the principal
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
makes that decision in that building
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
whether that course is going to be
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
as a final final uh just a follow-up on
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
that so basically there's
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
it would just be the parents that could
 
01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:23.030 align:start position:0%
it would just be the parents that could
then

01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
take the
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable justification
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
um and pursue anything for that to to
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
say you know that you need to accept
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand where we're going
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
basically what we're trying to establish
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
that if a horse is rejected by a
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
principle then they provide a reasonable
 
01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
justification to the parent for that
 
01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.270 align:start position:0%
justification to the parent for that
denial

01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
denial
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
when thank you for taking my question i
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
think i remember last year when it came
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
up that there were places that were not
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
accepting velax
 
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.870 align:start position:0%
accepting velax
courses

01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
we couldn't find an example of any place
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
that had said no
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
to velax and i don't know if that's
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
changed um
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
every place that we looked at did accept
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
the velax credits i i don't know of any
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
place that doesn't
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
is there a question in there
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes can can you give me examples of
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
places that don't accept velox credits
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
when we communicated with the department
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
of education department mentioned there
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
were some communities that have not they
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
did not give me the specific communities
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to ask them to do that
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's something between the department
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.830 align:start position:0%

next first news requested to testify

01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

for uh taking my testimony good morning
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
house education committee my name is
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
david dougherty i live in pembroke
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
i did write a letter to the committee
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
about this bill um which i hope you all
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
received and i think that
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
explains my position on it um
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i
 
01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:44.790 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i
uh

01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
did not have access to the amendment so
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
i can't really speak to that so i
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh my objection i'll just
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
highlight some of my objections and and
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
go from there i think this bill um
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
represents um you know
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislative overreach and micromanaging
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
i think the system that's
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
in place right now works
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh schools um most schools as far as i
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
know all schools in the state of new
 
01:37:20.239 --> 01:37:21.189 align:start position:0%
know all schools in the state of new
hampshire

01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
try to give credit um
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
to students where credit is due
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh occasionally there might be
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions uh to that case and and
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
because of local circumstances
 
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
i think that um any decision by um
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
typically counselors
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
do the initial input on that and then it
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
may go to a principal and if
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's some question about it it can
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
always go up to the school board i think
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
there's a chain of command that
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
would take care of all the situations
 
01:37:53.679 --> 01:37:55.109 align:start position:0%
would take care of all the situations
um

01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
i can't say i've ever had any experience
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
military credits but i do know that um
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
i did deal with uh
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
velox when it was first initiated in the
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
state and always
 
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.350 align:start position:0%
state and always
accepted

01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
credits for kids that was earned through
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
that institution
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
so i'll just wrap it up by saying that
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%

01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and many of the points have
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
already been covered so i'll try not to
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
take up too much of your time
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
and hsba is in opposition to house bill
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
182 as it's written
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
it does seem to not designate why
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
credits would be
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
looking to be granted the military
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
compact which is being referenced quite
 
01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:51.270 align:start position:0%
compact which is being referenced quite
often

01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
often
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
obviously speaks to a very specific
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
situation where military families are
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
moving from district to district or
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
state to state this does not really
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
designate why a student would be looking
 
01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.590 align:start position:0%
designate why a student would be looking
for

01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
credits to be transferred from one
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
school to another if it's for residency
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
purposes families are moving that
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
certainly makes some sense
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't quite understand in the bill
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
we can't quite understand why
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
what other reason a student would be
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
seeking to add credit from some other
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
program um
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
the word programs is also still not
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
really defined in terms of whether or
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
not that applies to
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
just approved school programs or whether
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
there's other programs that students
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
might be seeking to transfer credits
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
from one to another
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
and reasonably justified for for denial
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
is also not defined i think that
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
most schools would if they are going to
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
deny a student to be able to transfer in
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
a credit would be looking to make sure
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
that they knew what would be a
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
considered a reasonable justification to
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
deny something like that
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
um and it just it's unclear what
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
situations this would really apply to it
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
does seem like an awfully broad bill for
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
what could be a pretty narrow or
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
specific situation that hasn't been
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
addressed through some other legislation
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
or other rsas that are already in place
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
and it does contradict
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
um rsa 189.1 roman numeral ii the school
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
board's authority over its own programs
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that's to the point that
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
some of the other uh people that have
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
spoken on this bill already today might
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
have already referenced um and i just
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
want to close by saying i agree that
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
most districts in new hampshire i don't
 
01:41:33.679 --> 01:41:34.470 align:start position:0%
most districts in new hampshire i don't
think

01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
this is really an issue for students
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
when they move in
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
counselors are very attentive and put a
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
lot of time and care into transferring a
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
student from one district to another
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
district especially at the high school
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
level when there's so much at stake in
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
terms of credits there's a lot of
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
conversation that happens between school
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
districts to make sure that students are
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
meeting the right competencies that
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
they're placed in classes that are going
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
to cover competencies that maybe the
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
student hasn't already been exposed to
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
and not all courses cover the same
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
competencies from one district to
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
another so there's a lot of care that's
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
put into that process
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd just close and say i'm
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
you very much ms wilson for uh for
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning so um beyond the
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
um the issue that you just brought up
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
um competencies for you know a course in
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
one high school in new hampshire
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
not necessarily being the same as
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
competencies for a similar course
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
offered in a in another high school
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
aside from that um difference
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
do do you know do i guess do high
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
schools across the state
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
um have um do they all have the same
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements or or can they
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
have different graduation departments no
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
every local school board is responsible
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
for setting their own graduation
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
requirements in order to earn a school
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
district diploma from that particular
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
district there's obviously
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
core requirements that are required and
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
mandated across the state but many
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
schools offer different levels of
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
diplomas different types of diplomas a
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
different focus
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of that you can get an arts
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
diploma or new hampshire scholars
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
diploma there's many different
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
requirements for students across the
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
state so each district is responsible
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
for making sure that their program of
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
studies is going to allow students the
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to earn their specific
 
01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:36.149 align:start position:0%
opportunity to earn their specific
diploma

01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
diploma
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
so so um thanks miss wilson um for for
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
that so so how would it work then where
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
a um a course taken at one high school
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
would have to be accepted
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
as a credit towards high school
 
01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
as a credit towards high school
graduation

01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
by another
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
high school how would that even work
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
well to be perfectly honest i think for
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
the most part credits are awarded
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
towards graduation the place where
 
01:44:10.639 --> 01:44:11.830 align:start position:0%
towards graduation the place where
sometimes

01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreement is in terms of
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
what requirement that credit may meet
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
and i think that's where sometimes this
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
conversation might fall down a bit
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
in looking at competencies from one
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
course and one school to competencies
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
for another course at a different school
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
they may fall under different graduation
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and sometimes
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
what's considered quote a core
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
competency or a core course at one high
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
school might be considered an elective
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
type credit at a different school so
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's not that the student wouldn't get
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
the credit it's just it may not be
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
applied in the same category or in the
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
same way to the new school
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
so the way that this particular bill
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
reads as well i mean i think there's a
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
good opportunity that you would have
 
01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.030 align:start position:0%
good opportunity that you would have
students

01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
unless they're moving again for
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
residency purposes you if it has nothing
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
to do with that you may have students
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
who are earning far more credits so to
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
speak in the elective categories but it
 
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily shorten or change
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
the student's
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
four-year plan for graduation
 
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much miss wilson um
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
see no other hands uh we will move on to
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
our next person to testify
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh that would be uh
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hobson by the
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
end of the session you'll get it

01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
um nhsaa is opposed to
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
this bill we haven't seen the
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
amended language so
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm going to be speaking from
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
the language that's been posted for the
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
public to um to read
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
though i certainly understand
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative ladd's intent
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things i would just like to
 
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.270 align:start position:0%
one of the things i would just like to
say

01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
one of the differences
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
between the military families that are
 
01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:15.990 align:start position:0%
between the military families that are
moving

01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
around and
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
students within our own state military
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
students may have very limited choices
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
based on their parent posting of what
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of educational opportunities are
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
available to them so it's both fair and
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable i think to provide more
 
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.189 align:start position:0%
reasonable i think to provide more
latitude

01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
latitude
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
in accepting credits this is a different
 
01:46:35.119 --> 01:46:36.629 align:start position:0%
in accepting credits this is a different
situation

01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
although to some extent you could argue
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
that transients could be analogous
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
but i do have some questions about this
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
bill if
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
denial by the principal is
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
there has to be a justification with
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
that if a justification is provided
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
would that then be appealable
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the state board of education
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
my sense is that
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
the state board of education would say
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes the local school board would
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
probably say no
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
and it should be public information
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
which schools do not accept velax
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
credits this is not this should not be a
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
mystery to anyone
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
i'm only aware of one school district
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
that had a policy
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
excluding velax credits
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
early on when vlax was first created
 
01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:33.189 align:start position:0%
early on when vlax was first created
[Music]

01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
and that's constantly being used to
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
justify learn everywhere
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
in this type of legislation and that
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
district has long since changed their
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
policy so that problem no longer exists
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
my my sense is that what you're trying
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
to fix with this legislation has already
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
been fixed
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
principals and guidance counselors
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
already do the work outlined in this
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill no one wants to have students take
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
courses over if it's not necessary i
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
really think that this is a bill
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
and and with all due respect to
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative ladd there are a lot of
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
things that have changed in public
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
schools um
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
probably since your son transferred from
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
maine to alaska
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
so my guess is that you know we're
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
already doing this work uh this looks
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
like a bill that's uh in search of a
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
problem to fix when there is no problem
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh currently in this state
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with the acceptance of credits
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd i'd end my testimony
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you dr
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions so as
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
far as you know dr ladd there is no high
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
school in
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that does not accept relax
 
01:48:56.639 --> 01:48:58.070 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that does not accept relax
classes

01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
classes
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge there are none okay
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you um
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
dr ladd for taking my question it's it's
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
good to hear your voice um a question to
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
you is in relation to rule-making
 
01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:26.390 align:start position:0%
you is in relation to rule-making
authority

01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
do you believe
 
01:49:31.590 --> 01:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to pass
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
that the department of education
 
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:34.790 align:start position:0%
that the department of education
could

01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.990 align:start position:0%
in fact
impose

01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
impose
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
rules that would require
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
an overly harsh process that school
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
districts would have to follow
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
in order to make a denial in relation to
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
a particular course
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative heath i i would imagine
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
that the department
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
would request such
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
a stance from the state board of
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
education and that they would enter into
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
rule making we saw that a couple of
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
years ago when a fairly innocuous bill
 
01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:13.030 align:start position:0%
years ago when a fairly innocuous bill
um

01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
provided the opening for
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
the department of education to put
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
forward the learn everywhere program and
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
that to become part of rules when it was
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
not the intent of the original
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that enabled it so as much
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
as i certainly uh appreciate
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative ladd's
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
desire to
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
to to fix something
 
01:50:37.590 --> 01:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
i just think that this could end up
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
being a much broader issue
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
than it currently is
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you dr ladd i think we have one
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.719 --> 01:51:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes hi
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
um good morning everyone thank you uh
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd and members of the
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to speak
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
with you this morning um uh in
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
difference to time um respecting all of
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
your time and um as a result of the very
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
eloquent testimony offered this morning
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
by miss wilson and dr ladd i i don't
 
01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
need to repeat many of the points you've
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
already heard
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think i would just like to echo
 
01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:37.669 align:start position:0%
i think i would just like to echo
that

01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
this appears to this specific
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
legislation uh almost appears to
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
undermine the current processes that
 
01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
that exist
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
um really
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
a collaborative effort
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the review of transcripts is highly
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
collaborative uh exercise involving
 
01:51:57.119 --> 01:51:58.709 align:start position:0%
collaborative uh exercise involving
multiple

01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
staff members sending schools
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
end goal of being that we're focused on
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
the students
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
and the quality of their experiences
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
and the learning outcomes that that we
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
aspire um for collectively um many
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
districts already have as dr carl stated
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
very clear policies that um
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
are very transparent for members of the
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
community to understand what's
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
transferable and and what is not
 
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
relative to um credits and
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
you know i i have grave concerns
 
01:52:35.199 --> 01:52:36.229 align:start position:0%
you know i i have grave concerns
about

01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
our lack of definition of what
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
justification represents if a school
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
principle is to make the determination
 
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.629 align:start position:0%
principle is to make the determination
that

01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
denial of credits
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
is justified
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
it seems rather vague as to then what
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
next steps could be taken on behalf of a
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
party to overturn that decision and so
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
for for these reasons um we as an
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
organization oppose uh this bill and
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh i was taking some notes while while
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
you were talking to apologize if if i
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
missed this but um but you know we've
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
had some conflicting testimony um so far
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
this morning with representative ladd
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
saying that the department of education
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
actually has a list of schools that um
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
do not accept uh velax credit and dr la
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
dr carlad uh indicating that um that
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
he's not aware of any school that um
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
that does not accept delac's credit and
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if um
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
if if you can weigh in on one side or
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
the other on that um that conflict and
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
the evidence
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
certainly uh thank you for the question
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative luno um i i believe miss
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
wilson did um
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
allude to the fact that in rare
 
01:54:25.679 --> 01:54:26.950 align:start position:0%
allude to the fact that in rare
instances

01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
instances
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
um some
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
of velox credits may be considered
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
electives in some districts versus
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
competency-based transferable
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that is in my analysis and
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
in conversations with people in the
 
01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:42.390 align:start position:0%
in conversations with people in the
field

01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
really the only issue that um that we
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
have heard and it's very rare so again
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know this is why i have concerns
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to address the
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
exception rather than the rule by
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
proposing this piece of legislation
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much

um
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
point of order mr chair
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah so so 276 is scheduled for
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
10 a.m today
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
and um and so we're obviously we're a
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
little over an hour
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
behind but i do believe there's probably
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that you know
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
took today off to testify
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%

02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
to reschedule you at a minimum don't
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%

02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
and then recess to a time certain
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to reschedule to later to

02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
jumping past to putting it there we've
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
done that earlier the he sponsors the
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%

and
um

02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
without uh a sponsor being present we're
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
i will
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
put point of order though i mean um
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the past we've had um a
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee member
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%

for testimony uh from others
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe we've got a lot of people
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
probably here that are
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
waiting to testify
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do is what i had done
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
earlier with another bill i will go
 
02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
ahead and open it up and then i'm going
 
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
to immediately close it down and have it
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
continued later on this afternoon
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going would you please i challenge
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
the ruling of the chair
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think that disenfranchises members of
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
the public who have showed up today
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
taken time off from from their busy day
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%

02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
this and uh
 
02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:44.950 align:start position:0%
this and uh
um

02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%

um

02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
this will put off other people who are
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
waiting exactly
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
right how many people were signed up to
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%

02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%

02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
that exact language would be then
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
inserted into

02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
represent mullet
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much mr chair for
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
recognizing me and thank you
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative rung for bringing this to
 
02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
us today
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
um i just want to make sure because
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
i know you sent us that statute this
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
morning and i read it and i was no
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
clearer after i read it than i was
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
before i had it so
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that if somebody
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
were to die during the filing period
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
then a person would be appointed to fill
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
that position
 
02:31:35.359 --> 02:31:37.510 align:start position:0%
that position
until

02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
the next filing period when somebody
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
filed and ran for it and then a lot
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
could be had
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
exactly um the situation that occurred
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
in merrimack is
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
since mr heinrich died the day after the
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
filing period open people wanted to file
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
for that position for the the upcoming
 
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.110 align:start position:0%
for that position for the the upcoming
election

02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
and what we're saying is that we're
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to follow the protocol
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's outlined in
 
02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:07.590 align:start position:0%
that's outlined in
uh

02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
in towns related statute so that
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
that that that election for that vacancy
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen until the following
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
election not the one
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
um that's determined for that filing
 
02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:22.070 align:start position:0%
um that's determined for that filing
period

02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i explained that
 
02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
correctly there's a certain just a
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:29.429 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
so

02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
so that but the but the vacancy that was
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
created by the person
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
being deceased
 
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
would be appointed
 
02:32:44.070 --> 02:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
until that election the following year
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
right it
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
exactly it would be treated as if that
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
vacancy occurred after the filing period
 
02:32:57.860 --> 02:32:57.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:33:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
the end of available filing period in
 
02:33:09.670 --> 02:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
the election but i'm really
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit baffled why if there's a
 
02:33:15.750 --> 02:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
vacancy the final filing period is open
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
why prevent the town fault from uh
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
during a filing period from uh filing
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
for an open sea i i i could see
 
02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
between the end but
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
you would shut off people from
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
from uh filing when the filing period is
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
still open
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
well the thank you very much for your
 
02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
question uh representative uh the intent
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
is to be consistent with the the
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
statutes governing uh the filling of
 
02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:45.190 align:start position:0%
statutes governing uh the filling of
town

02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:33:49.270 --> 02:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies so um i think what what is
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
important is consistency between how we
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
feel vacancies on the town side and how
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
we fill vacancies on the school district
 
02:33:55.840 --> 02:33:56.710 align:start position:0%
we fill vacancies on the school district
side

02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
um i i think your proposal is is worth a
 
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
discussion but i think on the same point
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
it would then require a change in
 
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
section 669
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
we're really looking for consistency
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
this has been advice on the secretary of
 
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
state's office when this has happened on
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
the school side they just just follow
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
what you do for the town what we're
 
02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
asking for well if we're going to follow
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
what we do for the town let's make sure
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
we put it in the statute that governs
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
school district elections
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
what's your name uh thank you
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
so representative so if somebody passed
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
away the day before the filing period
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh people could
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
file for that seat but if he passed away
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
or she passed away a day later at the
 
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
beginning of the filing period they
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
could not file for that is that is that
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
correct am i reading that correctly
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes that's consistent with what is in
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
669 governing town elections
 
02:34:54.309 --> 02:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
we just want consistency between how we
 
02:34:56.309 --> 02:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
elect people for town offices and how we
 
02:34:58.950 --> 02:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
elect them for school district offices
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your questions
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
it was basically the same question
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
why would we not want people to file
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
if the filing period was still open
 
02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:20.790 align:start position:0%
if the filing period was still open
um

02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question
 
02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
represent like us i i mean it's a
 
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
worthwhile discussion but our point is
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
at this is to make consistency between
 
02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
what's in statute for the town and
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
what's in statute for the school
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
district if if we want to say hey let's
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
let's fill vacancies that occur during
 
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
the filing period
 
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm open to having that discussion
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to have it on the
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
town side too i think it's very
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
confusing to voters and prospective
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
candidates when we have
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
one set of rules for how we govern
 
02:35:53.750 --> 02:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
filling town
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
vacancies but then we lack any guidance
 
02:35:58.389 --> 02:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
for filling those on the school district
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
side we just want some consistency
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question
 
02:36:06.630 --> 02:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
are there further questions of
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative rome yes uh yes griffin
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%

for the question thank you for taking
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't hear that question
 
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
sorry there wasn't a microphone near me
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just looking and i'm looking at
 
02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
like selectmen and it doesn't say
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
anything about this it says vacancy and
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
the board shall be filled by
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
appointments made by the remaining
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
selectmen and there's no reference at
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
all about
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
filing period and
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to concern where
 
02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
have you found that this makes it
 
02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with other officers
 
02:36:59.429 --> 02:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean if you'll see in
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
what i sent you this morning section 669
 
02:37:04.950 --> 02:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
there is a sentence there that governs
 
02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
how to fill a vacancy if it occurs
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
during the filing period
 
02:37:09.359 --> 02:37:10.469 align:start position:0%
during the filing period
um

02:37:10.469 --> 02:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
but that that does not exist in school
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
district in in in school district
 
02:37:18.230 --> 02:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
vacancy language
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
could you give me the sub paragraph
 
02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
because i'm looking look
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
in 669 69 colon 6 1 roman numeral 3 i
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
think is where it is yes it says any
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
vacancy which occurs between the
 
02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
beginning of the filing period and the
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
town election
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
shall not be filled by official ballot
 
02:37:41.349 --> 02:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
until the annual town election the
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
following year
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
so that same sentence that's in 409 that
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
we want to put into the school district
 
02:37:48.319 --> 02:37:49.830 align:start position:0%
we want to put into the school district
statute

02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
but i okay uh
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
further go ahead
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
i could see that
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the law in both i can see that now
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
but doesn't that really refer to
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
if nobody has filed
 
02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.429 align:start position:0%
if nobody has filed
um

02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
no what it what it does it just extends
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
that vacancy until after the election so
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
it can be appointed and then and then
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
the person would you know candidates
 
02:38:21.910 --> 02:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
would then run at the following
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh year the annual town election or
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
school district election the following
 
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
year you have another follow-up yes so
 
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this precludes
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
other people for running for that office
 
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody dies i mean
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
do you think that's right
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
um i i like i said i think it's worth to
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
have a discussion the intent of this
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
bill is just to
 
02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
bill is just to
um

02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:49.270 align:start position:0%
um
direct

02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
direct
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
school districts on how to fill those
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
vacancies that occur during a filing
 
02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:54.389 align:start position:0%
vacancies that occur during a filing
period

02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
and we want to make it consistent with
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
how we fill them at the at the town
 
02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.510 align:start position:0%
how we fill them at the at the town
level

02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
now if we want to bring up uh another
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
subject about well let's
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
let's have people be able to file if
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
there is a vacancy that occurs during
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
the filing period i'm open for that
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
discussion but we need to do it on the
 
02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
town side too not just the school
 
02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:16.389 align:start position:0%
town side too not just the school
district

02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult in a community where
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
we have one way of filling vacancies on
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
town side and another way of filling
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
them on the school district side and
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
actually we don't even have another way
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
of filling them on the school district
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
side because there's no language in the
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
statute that governs that
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
hb 409 intends to remedy that by having
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
language in statute to guide how we fill
 
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
those vacancies
 
02:39:42.389 --> 02:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
and then you know if
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
if there's a discussion if there's
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
another bill filed to allow
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
um people to run for office during the
 
02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
filing period
 
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
i'm open having that discussion but we
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
should make sure that it applies to both
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
town and school district thank you very
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
02:40:00.389 --> 02:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
no no further questions for
 
02:40:04.830 --> 02:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative we do have deputy
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
secretary uh dave scanlan ready
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
um perhaps that would be probably the
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
best way to
 
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:15.349 align:start position:0%
best way to
do

02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:40:15.359 --> 02:40:16.469 align:start position:0%
do
next

02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
yeah unless there's another question for
 
02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:27.990 align:start position:0%
yeah unless there's another question for
representative

02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee i'm david scanlon deputy
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and appearing today
 
02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill that
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative wrong has sponsored
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
because it does clarify the statute
 
02:40:45.030 --> 02:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the advice that we
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
would give to school districts if a
 
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
vacancy occurred
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
in this manner
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
you know i understand that there is a
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
question is why do we close it off at
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
the first day of the filing period in
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to put somebody on
 
02:41:00.630 --> 02:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
the ballot there's a couple of reasons
 
02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
for that the first one is administrative
 
02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:04.309 align:start position:0%
for that the first one is administrative
and

02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
it there's a process by which
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
constituents citizens in a community
 
02:41:13.270 --> 02:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
are aware of offices that are up for
 
02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:14.389 align:start position:0%
are aware of offices that are up for
election

02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:41:16.070 --> 02:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
and they can make a determination ahead
 
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
of time plan on running for the office
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
and sign up and and get their name on
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
when a vacancy occurs during the filing
 
02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:26.230 align:start position:0%
when a vacancy occurs during the filing
period

02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
there is at that point no time to
 
02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
advertise that that they that that
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
there's a potential opening on the
 
02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:33.750 align:start position:0%
there's a potential opening on the
ballot

02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
to run for an office and so it it
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
precludes you know the full spectrum of
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
potential candidates from
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
being able to participate
 
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
the second
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
the second
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
aspect of this is
 
02:41:48.399 --> 02:41:50.150 align:start position:0%
aspect of this is
is

02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
not creating an opportunity for games to
 
02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
be played on who might get on the ballot
 
02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
a vacancy occurs for other reasons
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
besides somebody just passing away
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
it can be cut it can because uh somebody
 
02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
moves out of town
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
and is no longer qualified to be on the
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
ballot or it can simply be somebody's
 
02:42:08.399 --> 02:42:09.510 align:start position:0%
ballot or it can simply be somebody's
resigns

02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
resigns
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
they submit a letter of resignation um
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know if that is done on the last day
 
02:42:16.230 --> 02:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
of the filing period and conveniently
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's somebody else to step up and say
 
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to run for that office and
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
sign up
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh that's hardly fair either and
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason why the policy is
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
the way it is it's why the
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh statute for town elections
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh specifically states this is the way
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
the process would be
 
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and we believe it that it's the
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
right process
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
so again we support representative runs
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislation and i would be happy to
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
02:42:48.309 --> 02:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr scanlon uh
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative moffat do you have a
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
question i used to do it thank you thank
 
02:42:52.319 --> 02:42:52.950 align:start position:0%
question i used to do it thank you thank
you

02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
very much uh thank you mr deputy
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:04.389 --> 02:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh staggered positions uh
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
so my question for you is
 
02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:13.190 align:start position:0%
so my question for you is
is

02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:15.270 --> 02:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh is that different than someone who
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
dies who is not
 
02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:21.190 align:start position:0%
dies who is not
making

02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:24.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:25.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:27.270 --> 02:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
well if if somebody is up for
 
02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:28.870 align:start position:0%
well if if somebody is up for
re-election

02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
re-election
 
02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:31.190 align:start position:0%
re-election
um

02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:32.469 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
so there would be an open filing period
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
because that that office is on the
 
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
ballot if a candidate dies um or passes
 
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:40.950 align:start position:0%
ballot if a candidate dies um or passes
away

02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:43:44.469 --> 02:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
after they have filed or um
 
02:43:46.309 --> 02:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh or you know
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
sometime before between the filing
 
02:43:49.349 --> 02:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
period and the election
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
um that person's name would simply be
 
02:43:54.150 --> 02:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
removed from the ballot at that point uh
 
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
because of the of the death or the
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh or the uh
 
02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
resignation and then i for town and
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
school district elections
 
02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh there is no other opportunity for
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else to step forward and run
 
02:44:09.429 --> 02:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
for that office because these offices
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
are nonpartisan it's you know anybody
 
02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
can run
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
the situation that we are talking about
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
with this legislation is
 
02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:21.349 align:start position:0%
in the case of
uh

02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
a an office holder whose position is not
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
up for election
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh and that office then becomes vacant
 
02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh and that office then becomes vacant
um

02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:33.750 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and the standard practice is no
 
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
matter when when it happens during the
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
course of a year and say after the
 
02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
election's over
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know we're into the month of august
 
02:44:42.319 --> 02:44:43.269 align:start position:0%
you know we're into the month of august
and

02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then there's a vacancy that occurs
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
the standard practice is that the
 
02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
appointing authority
 
02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:50.950 align:start position:0%
appointing authority
um

02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:52.230 --> 02:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
it could be the school board in this
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
case could be the board of selectmen it
 
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
could be the planning board or the
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
zoning board depending on what office
 
02:45:00.150 --> 02:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about get to make the
 
02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:01.990 align:start position:0%
you're talking about get to make the
appointment

02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
until the next election and then an
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
election would be held to fill the
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
unexpired term of that particular office
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
what what this language is doing is just
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
it just talks about
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh what happens in you know when you get
 
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
close to the proximity where people are
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
actually signing up to run for office
 
02:45:24.790 --> 02:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
for the next election and
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
um the the the policy has been and the
 
02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
statute in the case of towns has been
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
that that there is a clear delineation
 
02:45:31.840 --> 02:45:32.550 align:start position:0%
that that there is a clear delineation
of

02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
of you know if there is a vacancy
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
whether an appointment is made versus
 
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
when uh somebody is able to get their
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
name on the ballot and run for that uh
 
02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
that position
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes follow up uh
 
02:45:47.269 --> 02:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so what i'm hearing
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh mr deputy secretary is uh to my
 
02:45:52.870 --> 02:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
earlier question if it's a position
 
02:45:55.349 --> 02:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's not scheduled for reelection i
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
think i understand that that
 
02:45:57.279 --> 02:45:58.230 align:start position:0%
think i understand that that
would

02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
the statute would cover that like if
 
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:03.030 align:start position:0%
the statute would cover that like if
representative

02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
school board member smith is a is up for
 
02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
re-election and i have been planning to
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
run against school school board member
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
smith and he dies the first day of
 
02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:14.790 align:start position:0%
smith and he dies the first day of
filing

02:46:14.790 --> 02:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
filing
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
when i was going to file to run for
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
receipt would this preclude me from
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
running for uh school board for a seat
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
that i've been playing to run for that
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
was open
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
no because if the seat is up for
 
02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
election there's a filing period that's
 
02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
taking place for that seat and so if the
 
02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.670 align:start position:0%
taking place for that seat and so if the
incumbent

02:46:33.670 --> 02:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
incumbent
 
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
who is also running for the office
 
02:46:37.510 --> 02:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
passes away
 
02:46:39.429 --> 02:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
during that filing period
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
at that point it does not preclude
 
02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else from stepping forward and
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
signing up
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
because the filing period is open
 
02:46:47.910 --> 02:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
specifically for that office
 
02:46:50.309 --> 02:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about in this in this
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is a bill
 
02:46:55.269 --> 02:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh is for a position
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
that would not be up for
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
its its normal election cycle it would
 
02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
be mid-term i'll call it and um
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
if let's say if the if the person
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
holding the office still has two years
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
left in the term and they die a vacancy
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
exists that office would not normally be
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
on the ballot
 
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh if the person created the vacancy
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
prior to the filing period there would
 
02:47:21.510 --> 02:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity to put it on the
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
ballot for the remaining balance of the
 
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
term whatever that might be
 
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
this this language is dealing
 
02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
specifically with a position that would
 
02:47:33.429 --> 02:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
not otherwise be up for election
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that interests my question
 
02:47:36.630 --> 02:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative you
 
02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:47:42.309 --> 02:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
taking the question so i just want to
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
clarify here
 
02:47:46.469 --> 02:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
so if i'm on a school board and i resign
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
the day before the filing period
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
that office is open for election
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
but if i resign
 
02:47:56.389 --> 02:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
once the filing period opens the day the
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
filing period opens that office is not
 
02:48:02.309 --> 02:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
open for the next election and is uh my
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
vacancy would be filled by appointment
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
am i correct on that you are correct
 
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
what is the logic behind that one day
 
02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:11.670 align:start position:0%
what is the logic behind that one day
difference

02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:13.349 align:start position:0%
difference
uh

02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's a good question
 
02:48:17.110 --> 02:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
except i think so too
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
except that you know the filing period
 
02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
has has opened up at that point and
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
and there was no uh there was no prior
 
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
advertisement for the position and
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
granted in the scenario that you just
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
described there would be little
 
02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to advertise
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
you know that position as well i mean i
 
02:48:34.479 --> 02:48:35.830 align:start position:0%
you know that position as well i mean i
understand

02:48:35.830 --> 02:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the situation but in this case it's just
 
02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
a it's a line that's drawn
 
02:48:42.389 --> 02:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh in the sand
 
02:48:44.469 --> 02:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh are there further questions for the
 
02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
02:48:51.750 --> 02:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr scanlan my
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.790 --> 02:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
who's next here
 
02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
any years back
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
yes i can hear you can you hear me
 
02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:24.469 align:start position:0%
yes i can hear you can you hear me
excellent

02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm the merrimack school district clerk
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i've been the clerk for 25 years
 
02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
and i've been sitting here because i
 
02:49:33.910 --> 02:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
knew the answers to most many of the
 
02:49:36.389 --> 02:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
questions um i asked representative rung
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
to put this forward
 
02:49:41.110 --> 02:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
because when my husband died during the
 
02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
filing period
 
02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:43.510 align:start position:0%
filing period
um

02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
well let me start this by saying
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
when other members of the
 
02:49:51.190 --> 02:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
school board or the school budget
 
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
committee or the school planning
 
02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
committee would talk to me about i'm
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
thinking of resigning i would tell them
 
02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
always resign before filing period so i
 
02:50:03.510 --> 02:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
can advertise the position properly
 
02:50:05.269 --> 02:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
or wait until after the election and
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
then let the board that you're on deal
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
with the vacancy
 
02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:09.830 align:start position:0%
with the vacancy
um

02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in this case and my
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
husband died after the filing period
 
02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:14.710 align:start position:0%
husband died after the filing period
opened

02:50:14.710 --> 02:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
opened
 
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
i called the superintendent i called the
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office and was told
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
that there is nothing in
 
02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:24.389 align:start position:0%
that there is nothing in
671

02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
671
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
but they suggest to school districts and
 
02:50:30.389 --> 02:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
school district clerks that they follow
 
02:50:30.399 --> 02:50:33.269 align:start position:0%
school district clerks that they follow
669.

02:50:33.269 --> 02:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
669.
 
02:50:35.190 --> 02:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
they also suggest that i contact our
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
school council which i did and the
 
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
school uh legal counsel told me to
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
follow 669.
 
02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:43.110 align:start position:0%
follow 669.
um

02:50:43.110 --> 02:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
i found myself thinking this has
 
02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
happened before and let's prevent it
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
from happening again
 
02:50:50.230 --> 02:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
if it's good enough for the town it
 
02:50:52.230 --> 02:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
should be good enough for the schools
 
02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to see that language
 
02:50:57.269 --> 02:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
inserted in 671 to cover this
 
02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
i had people come up to me
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
the day before my husband's funeral to
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
that the budget committee could tell me
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
i had to put it on the ballot
 
02:51:09.030 --> 02:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh i had people tell me that the
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office suggested
 
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
there was a gray area
 
02:51:15.590 --> 02:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
and this could be put on the ballot
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
but just like people that file for
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
office you have to be registered to vote
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
before the filing period opens
 
02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:23.590 align:start position:0%
before the filing period opens
and

02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
the seat has to be vacant before the
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
filing period opens
 
02:51:29.110 --> 02:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
i agree with that and i would like to
 
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
see that i'm asking you to please put
 
02:51:33.269 --> 02:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
that in
 
02:51:34.950 --> 02:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
because we do have people that have
 
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
resigned that not just die but resign
 
02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
and it would be nice our the town filing
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
period is the same as the school
 
02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
district filing period
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
and since there's something in the
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
town's election law that says the
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
vacancy will be filled according to the
 
02:51:53.830 --> 02:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
body if a vacancy occurs during the
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
filing period
 
02:51:56.950 --> 02:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to have the town and the
 
02:51:58.950 --> 02:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
school be the same
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
rather than have the town do it one way
 
02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
and the school do it another way
 
02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
and in my husband's case in particular
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
originally we had a municipal budget
 
02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:09.830 align:start position:0%
originally we had a municipal budget
committee

02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:52:11.830 --> 02:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
and until we had a town charter that
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
eliminated the municipal budget
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
committee in his case he has an elected
 
02:52:18.309 --> 02:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
seat on the school planning board and he
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
had an elected seat on it at that time
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
the municipal budget committee
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we could be looking at a case where
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
the town didn't put the budget committee
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
seat on the town ballot and
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
what's the school supposed to do
 
02:52:35.429 --> 02:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
for the same person's death
 
02:52:37.269 --> 02:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
people do resign
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
but hopefully they contact me ahead of
 
02:52:42.389 --> 02:52:42.399 align:start position:0%
time so that i can have them file before
 
02:52:44.710 --> 02:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
that i can have them resign before the
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
filing period opens so that i can
 
02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
advertise the seat because in merrimack
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
we do advertise the filing period and
 
02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
what positions are open
 
02:52:56.790 --> 02:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you for listening to me
 
02:52:59.910 --> 02:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the presenter
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh steve next we have
 
02:53:09.429 --> 02:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
um school board association
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to education
 
02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
hobson thank you very much chairman ladd
 
02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bear christina
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire school board
 
02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:19.510 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire school board
association

02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:53:22.309 --> 02:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
um we were initially opposed to house
 
02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill 409 and we're gonna keep that
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
opposition on the record but um hearing
 
02:53:29.750 --> 02:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative rung um and and the other
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
speakers uh state why they think this is
 
02:53:35.349 --> 02:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
um a good bill uh
 
02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
and and representative rung did say a
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
couple times that she thinks it was
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
worth the conversation um we think
 
02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
retaining this would probably be
 
02:53:45.269 --> 02:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate so we can um sort through
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
the myriad of statutes in rsa 671 and
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 669.
 
02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
the other statute that i would like to
 
02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
um point you to just in case there would
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
be a conflict between house bill 409 is
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
rsa 197 colon 26.
 
02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
um this says uh the school board shall
 
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
fill vacancies occurring on the board
 
02:54:08.950 --> 02:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
and in other districts except that a
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
moderator until the next annual meeting
 
02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the district
 
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
the shell means that they have to and
 
02:54:17.590 --> 02:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
that they have to fill the vacancy so i
 
02:54:21.030 --> 02:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
just not sure how filling that vacancy
 
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
um to the next annual meeting would
 
02:54:25.429 --> 02:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
would play into
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
um playing into the election um aspect
 
02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
that this is this is trying to address
 
02:54:31.439 --> 02:54:32.550 align:start position:0%
that this is this is trying to address
um

02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:34.389 --> 02:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative moffat we had some the
 
02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
same questions um that you had um and
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
one aspect i would um
 
02:54:42.469 --> 02:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
like to to point out with respect to
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
attorney scanlon's testimony i believe
 
02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
he wrote this is for a seat that is in
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
mid-term it's not for an open seat
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
because there seems to be a lot of
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
questions about well i was planning on
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
running it anyway um if that's the case
 
02:54:58.950 --> 02:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think the language of the bills
 
02:54:58.960 --> 02:54:59.990 align:start position:0%
i don't think the language of the bills
clearly

02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
states that i think this occurs to all
 
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
vacancies that occur within that filing
 
02:55:08.469 --> 02:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
period window i don't think that as
 
02:55:10.630 --> 02:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
written it would only occur to sort of
 
02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:11.670 align:start position:0%
written it would only occur to sort of
mid

02:55:11.670 --> 02:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
mid
 
02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:12.710 align:start position:0%
mid
term

02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
term
 
02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:14.070 align:start position:0%
term
vacancies

02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
so um those were some of the concerns
 
02:55:18.950 --> 02:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
that nhsba had with the bill
 
02:55:20.870 --> 02:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
um again we appreciate representative
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
rung for for bringing this up um and and
 
02:55:26.070 --> 02:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
indeed having the conversation uh there
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
are a lot of areas where school
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
districts have to borrow from rsa 669
 
02:55:34.230 --> 02:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
because rsa 671 is not specifically
 
02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:35.349 align:start position:0%
because rsa 671 is not specifically
clear

02:55:35.349 --> 02:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
but apparently this is another one of
 
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
those issues but again we have some
 
02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about the perhaps unintended
 
02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
consequences how this may relate to rsa
 
02:55:47.349 --> 02:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
197 colon 26 as i mentioned and i think
 
02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
language needs to be if the intent is
 
02:55:51.429 --> 02:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
that this is only to apply to to
 
02:55:54.630 --> 02:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
mid-term seats um then i think that
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be made more explicit within
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
the bill so while we do oppose the bill
 
02:56:00.790 --> 02:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
um we think that um retaining the bill
 
02:56:02.309 --> 02:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
maybe working on some language over the
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
summer or the fall might be appropriate
 
02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
and with that um uh conclude my
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
testimony i'm happy to take any
 
02:56:09.910 --> 02:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh mr
 
02:56:11.670 --> 02:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
christina are there questions for the
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
not seen
 
02:56:20.230 --> 02:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:43.050 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:43.050 --> 02:56:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have any other
 
02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
books no
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
so with that can you please give us a
 
02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
reading on
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative hobson can you somehow
 
02:57:35.030 --> 02:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
get a microphone closer to you because
 
02:57:36.790 --> 02:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible to hear what
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying and that may be the
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
problem that people who are supposed to
 
02:57:42.790 --> 02:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
be speaking have no idea that you're
 
02:57:45.269 --> 02:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
calling on them can you hear me now
 
02:57:45.279 --> 02:57:47.349 align:start position:0%
calling on them can you hear me now
yes

02:57:47.349 --> 02:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
valerie vallant
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:58.490 --> 02:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
able to speak did you not hear me before
 
02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:02.070 align:start position:0%
able to speak did you not hear me before
[Music]

02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay sorry and uh
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
rep lei you've had your hand up as well
 
02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i just had a i was just wondering
 
02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
if uh uh mr scanlon is still available
 
02:58:14.630 --> 02:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh or if we could just send him a
 
02:58:16.870 --> 02:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
question um i was just wondering what
 
02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
happens if somebody it's if if it is
 
02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
restricted to just those
 
02:58:23.750 --> 02:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
um seats that are up for election and
 
02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
let's say i'm running
 
02:58:27.910 --> 02:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh for re-election and i suddenly pass
 
02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh for re-election and i suddenly pass
away

02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
um during the filing period but someone
 
02:58:32.950 --> 02:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
has already filed to run against me is
 
02:58:36.309 --> 02:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
that person now barred to run
 
02:58:39.349 --> 02:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
he's no longer uh attending
 
02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah see i think there are just
 
02:58:42.790 --> 02:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:58:45.269 --> 02:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
different permutations that haven't been
 
02:58:50.309 --> 02:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
right i agree okay sorry i'll ask later
 
02:58:52.630 --> 02:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:58:54.550 --> 02:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
from in my notes
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh he said
 
02:58:57.429 --> 02:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
02:59:01.269 --> 02:59:01.279 align:start position:0%
only an unexpired term so you wouldn't
 
02:59:01.279 --> 02:59:02.469 align:start position:0%
only an unexpired term so you wouldn't
be

02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
up for
 
02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
elections so it wouldn't apply to you
 
02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
in in the statement you just uh
 
02:59:11.030 --> 02:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
the question you just have so it's just
 
02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
for vacancies where the seat is not up
 
02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
for election
 
02:59:18.469 --> 02:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
are there further
 
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
concerns okay uh what was the final
 
02:59:25.269 --> 02:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
count there
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
so final count i have three at support
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
six oppose
 
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
zero neutral and total testifying would
 
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
be three
 
02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
four does that four test five is four
 
02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:43.190 --> 02:59:43.200 align:start position:0%

okay i'm gonna try to get that in so we
 
03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
can take our break then at 12 30.
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%

152
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is relevant to the apportionment of
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:29.429 --> 03:00:29.439 align:start position:0%

before which is on
 
03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
apportionment language in
 
03:01:06.870 --> 03:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
rsa 195 colon 8 so i have written
 
03:01:08.790 --> 03:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
testimony so i can keep within my time
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
frame and then i'm happy to take
 
03:01:10.160 --> 03:01:11.349 align:start position:0%
frame and then i'm happy to take
questions

03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm representative cat mcgee of

and the moderators therein who uncovered
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
a problem in the statute that they
 
03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
thought could easily be solved
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
so the bill proposes a small change to
 
03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 195 colon 8
 
03:01:36.710 --> 03:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
which already calls for apportionment
 
03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
calculations to be revisited every five
 
03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:40.070 align:start position:0%
calculations to be revisited every five
years

03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
and no sooner
 
03:01:43.030 --> 03:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:01:45.590 --> 03:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
the trigger for five years
 
03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
will no longer be merely based on a
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
formula change
 
03:01:54.469 --> 03:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
but also if an article a warrant article
 
03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
to continue the current formula has been
 
03:01:58.389 --> 03:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
passed at the district meeting
 
03:02:01.269 --> 03:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
so the idea is right now the language
 
03:02:03.830 --> 03:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
um promotes the fact that a change has
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
to be um reached
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
and in several of the meetings i've been
 
03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
to recently there's you know with when
 
03:02:12.710 --> 03:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
the five-year anniversary is up there'll
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
be a vote for a dollar change or
 
03:02:15.510 --> 03:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
whatever because they don't really want
 
03:02:17.190 --> 03:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
to revisit that
 
03:02:18.790 --> 03:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
for anyone who
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
is in um
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
a a portion a district co-op
 
03:02:26.389 --> 03:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
they understand that
 
03:02:28.309 --> 03:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
those negotiations can be very
 
03:02:30.469 --> 03:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
contentious a lot of money goes back and
 
03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
forth depending on changes to the
 
03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:32.870 align:start position:0%
forth depending on changes to the
formula

03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:02:35.830 --> 03:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
and so from the moderators perspective
 
03:02:38.469 --> 03:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
this change would make
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
the process of being able to allow the
 
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
governing body to have a vote on whether
 
03:02:45.429 --> 03:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
they're happy with the formula without
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
making a change
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
and then they would be able to continue
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
for five years from that
 
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
folks had posited questions of the
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
moderator when he first proposed this
 
03:02:57.670 --> 03:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
change as to well what if that vote
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
fails and if it fails then you just stay
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the same calendar that you're on for
 
03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
revisiting apportionment
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
i i i didn't read what i have here
 
03:03:09.190 --> 03:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
because that's basically it in a
 
03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:10.389 align:start position:0%
because that's basically it in a
nutshell

03:03:10.389 --> 03:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
nutshell
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
and so um i also wanted to mention to
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
you that our long-time moderator and
 
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
most experienced moderator in town is
 
03:03:20.309 --> 03:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
the honorable jim bellander who was the
 
03:03:22.389 --> 03:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
former chair of municipal county and
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
government and he is on the line
 
03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
although he is moderating our elections
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
today because it's town election day um
 
03:03:31.830 --> 03:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
as is the current um moderator for the
 
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
town drew mason who's the person who
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
first proposed this bill to me
 
03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
see if there's anything else
 
03:03:43.670 --> 03:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from here
 
03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:46.790 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from here
um

03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:03:49.670 --> 03:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think i think i've probably
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
given you enough to get you started and
 
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you'll have questions so
 
03:03:58.230 --> 03:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
um and there's jim as well so both of us
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
that you have but if you look
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
at um at the bolded language in 152
 
03:04:07.269 --> 03:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
that's probably in front of you
 
03:04:10.150 --> 03:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's just adding language that says
 
03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
if the apportionment formula for a
 
03:04:13.750 --> 03:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district has been
 
03:04:15.429 --> 03:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
duly changed
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
and it adds or if an article to continue
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
the current formula has been passed at
 
03:04:23.190 --> 03:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
the district meeting so that's all we're
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
trying to do is just add language that
 
03:04:27.510 --> 03:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
supports the idea that the body can
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
decide not to make a change and also
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
agree that the formula is sufficient for
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
another five years
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
so i hope that makes sense
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:43.590 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
representative

03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
not seen in hands thank you very much
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
next we have uh the honorable
 
03:04:57.670 --> 03:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
jim belanger i've promoted him uh
 
03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
welcome to education
 
03:05:03.590 --> 03:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much uh for uh
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
welcoming me i thought i got uh shut off
 
03:05:07.590 --> 03:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
there for a second because the whole
 
03:05:09.990 --> 03:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
thing disappeared and then came back
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
just when representative mcgee was
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
paying me compliments
 
03:05:16.950 --> 03:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm jim belanger of hollis new hampshire
 
03:05:18.790 --> 03:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
and are representing myself
 
03:05:21.670 --> 03:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
and mr drew mason the current moderator
 
03:05:23.110 --> 03:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
of the hollis brookline cooperative
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
school district
 
03:05:27.030 --> 03:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
who is also the town moderator and is
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
busy at the polls today as you can
 
03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:31.030 align:start position:0%
busy at the polls today as you can
imagine

03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a former new hampshire state rep
 
03:05:34.469 --> 03:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
serving on the municipal county
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
government committee for nine years
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
and if you add my years of being a
 
03:05:42.309 --> 03:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
moderator in town for town school and
 
03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district i have 40
 
03:05:47.349 --> 03:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
years of experience this bill makes
 
03:05:47.359 --> 03:05:48.389 align:start position:0%
years of experience this bill makes
sense

03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 152 concerns an issue which
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
simply provides a fix
 
03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
for a loophole in current legislation
 
03:05:57.670 --> 03:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
right now the apportionment formula for
 
03:05:59.429 --> 03:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
a cooperative school district is subject
 
03:06:02.230 --> 03:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
to be reviewed every five years
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
most have no objection to this if after
 
03:06:07.990 --> 03:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
review the formula is changed and then
 
03:06:10.550 --> 03:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
it can be reviewed again in five years
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
however the way current law is worded if
 
03:06:15.269 --> 03:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
the formula is reviewed and found to be
 
03:06:15.279 --> 03:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
the formula is reviewed and found to be
satisfactory

03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
satisfactory
 
03:06:18.790 --> 03:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
it can be reviewed again the next year
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
and the next year and the next year
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
isn't reviewing and deciding to leave it
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
alone a decision that should also have a
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
five-year term
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
what if the formula is changed by one
 
03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
what if the formula is changed by one
penny

03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
penny
 
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
i ask you to recognize that taking up an
 
03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
article debating it and deciding to
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
leave it as is
 
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
meets the intent of the current rsas and
 
03:06:42.230 --> 03:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
should be considered the same as if one
 
03:06:44.550 --> 03:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
penny had been added to the formula
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
the voters took it up
 
03:06:48.870 --> 03:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
spoke about it and decided it was good
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
as is and that should suffice for the
 
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
next five years
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
now that's my input and because
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
moderator drew mason could not be here i
 
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
would like to read his comments
 
03:07:02.309 --> 03:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
i am the moderator of the hollis
 
03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
brookline cooperative school district i
 
03:07:06.230 --> 03:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
would like to thank representative mcgee
 
03:07:08.469 --> 03:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
for filing this bill and for working
 
03:07:10.469 --> 03:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
with me through the process
 
03:07:12.389 --> 03:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill is a small but
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
important improvement to the rsas about
 
03:07:14.720 --> 03:07:16.309 align:start position:0%
important improvement to the rsas about
apportionment

03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure you know the costs of
 
03:07:20.550 --> 03:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts are divided
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
among the participating towns
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
by an abortion formula
 
03:07:27.510 --> 03:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
under current law once adopted the
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
formula can be reviewed after five years
 
03:07:31.510 --> 03:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
but no sooner
 
03:07:33.190 --> 03:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
if the voters in the cooperative school
 
03:07:35.429 --> 03:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
district change the formula the new
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
formula is enforced for at least another
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
five years
 
03:07:41.590 --> 03:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
the key word in that statement is change
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
in order to enter a new five-year period
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
of formula stability the voters must
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
change the formula
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
the requirement of the change and the
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
formula has come up the last two times
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
that my district has voted on
 
03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:55.349 align:start position:0%
that my district has voted on
apportionment

03:07:55.349 --> 03:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
03:07:57.510 --> 03:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
this bill allows the voters to continue
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
using the current formula and have
 
03:08:01.590 --> 03:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
another five years of predictable
 
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
apportionment if they so choose in order
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
to keep the existing formula a majority
 
03:08:08.550 --> 03:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the voters in the cooperative
 
03:08:11.030 --> 03:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
district have to vote in favor of it
 
03:08:13.030 --> 03:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
the apportionment formula is about as
 
03:08:15.510 --> 03:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
basic and direct as a
 
03:08:17.830 --> 03:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
pocketbook issue as there can be
 
03:08:20.150 --> 03:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
with a single vote millions of dollars
 
03:08:23.349 --> 03:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
in taxes can be shifted among downs
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
up with the suitable apportionment
 
03:08:27.349 --> 03:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
formula requires careful research
 
03:08:29.110 --> 03:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
thought and all
 
03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:30.469 align:start position:0%
thought and all
compromise

03:08:30.469 --> 03:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
03:08:32.950 --> 03:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
it can be quite contentious restricting
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
the frequency of review
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
of the formula allows the voters school
 
03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
board and budget committee to focus on
 
03:08:40.950 --> 03:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
other things
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
the legislators who created the concept
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
of a cooperative school district had the
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
foresight to provide for a five-year gap
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
between formula reviews this is a very
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
this bill says that if voters choose to
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
continue with the existing formula
 
03:08:58.630 --> 03:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
or choose to change the formula they can
 
03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
enjoy another five years with
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
predictable formula when i explain this
 
03:09:06.309 --> 03:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
bill to folks they ask what happens if
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
the bill apportionment article is
 
03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:09.670 align:start position:0%
the bill apportionment article is
defeated

03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
03:09:11.510 --> 03:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
the answer is exactly the same as
 
03:09:13.670 --> 03:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
current law the then current formula
 
03:09:16.150 --> 03:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
continues to be used and the voters may
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
take up apportionment at the next annual
 
03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:19.510 align:start position:0%
take up apportionment at the next annual
meeting

03:09:19.510 --> 03:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
the five-year period does not start
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of the nature of the defeated
 
03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:25.429 align:start position:0%
regardless of the nature of the defeated
article

03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
article
 
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
i know this phrase has been a bit
 
03:09:29.670 --> 03:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
overused but with this bill if you like
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
your apportionment formula you may keep
 
03:09:33.429 --> 03:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
it without going through the contentious
 
03:09:33.439 --> 03:09:34.469 align:start position:0%
it without going through the contentious
process

03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:09:37.030 --> 03:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
required by the current law
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
finally when hollis brookline went
 
03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
through a reapportionment and the school
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
board wanted to keep the existing
 
03:09:45.349 --> 03:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
formula because of current law the
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
school board had to propose the exact
 
03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
same formula then modify it to add one
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
dollar to hollis share
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
then explain to the voters why
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
i think it seemed a little silly to the
 
03:10:00.630 --> 03:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
voters but they did approve it quite
 
03:10:02.950 --> 03:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
handily 469
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
to 180.
 
03:10:05.910 --> 03:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
that concludes my
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
testimony on behalf of myself and
 
03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:10.560 align:start position:0%

chairman members of the committee i'll
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
be very brief uh nhsba supports um house
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
bill 152
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh we uh appreciate uh representative
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
mcgee and uh former representative
 
03:10:59.990 --> 03:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
belanger for their cogent statements on
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
this i just wanted to give you a little
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
bit of a background because um nhsba was
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
contacted it's my understanding about
 
03:11:08.070 --> 03:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
maybe three four maybe five years ago
 
03:11:09.990 --> 03:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
there was a petitioned warrant article
 
03:11:11.670 --> 03:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
in house brookline to change the
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
apportionment formula between the the
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
two towns for the cooperative school
 
03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:16.150 align:start position:0%
two towns for the cooperative school
district

03:11:16.150 --> 03:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:11:18.389 --> 03:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
at the annual meeting that petitioned
 
03:11:21.750 --> 03:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
warrant article was amended to basically
 
03:11:23.830 --> 03:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
keep the status quo
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
apportionment formula between the two
 
03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:26.710 align:start position:0%
apportionment formula between the two
towns

03:11:26.710 --> 03:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
that status quo amendment or the
 
03:11:31.750 --> 03:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to keep the status quo passed
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
so the question was is that a change
 
03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
because we the voters took some
 
03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
affirmative action on this warrant
 
03:11:41.349 --> 03:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
article so even though in reality it was
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
still remaining the same the question
 
03:11:44.790 --> 03:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
was whether or not that vote at the
 
03:11:46.710 --> 03:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
annual meeting constituted a change for
 
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
that five-year period um so um i i
 
03:11:52.630 --> 03:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
when i got that question i said that's a
 
03:11:54.309 --> 03:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
good question i don't have an answer to
 
03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
that so anyway um we think that um
 
03:11:59.910 --> 03:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
we think that this is good practice even
 
03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
if the apportionment formula does not
 
03:12:04.150 --> 03:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
change if the voters vote to keep the
 
03:12:06.309 --> 03:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
same apportionment formula
 
03:12:08.469 --> 03:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
having that five-year window in between
 
03:12:10.469 --> 03:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
bringing it back is is good for budget
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
committees good for school boards to be
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
able to budget and for people to have
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
some um uh semblance of understanding of
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
what their their fiscal impact is going
 
03:12:21.269 --> 03:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
to be so they can plan appropriately so
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
with that uh we certainly support um
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 152 and i'm happy to take any
 
03:12:25.279 --> 03:12:26.790 align:start position:0%
house bill 152 and i'm happy to take any
questions

03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%

this is a very
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
simple bill
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh asked we are all aware uh legislation
 
03:59:43.349 --> 03:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
in the last participants established a
 
03:59:45.910 --> 03:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
school funding commission
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
with a budget
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
of uh half a million dollars
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:59:52.080 --> 03:59:53.269 align:start position:0%
and that
commission

03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
has issued their report in december
 
04:00:01.189 --> 04:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
and uh i think that uh the work is done
 
04:00:02.790 --> 04:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
04:00:02.800 --> 04:00:04.469 align:start position:0%
and that the
commission

04:00:04.469 --> 04:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
04:00:09.750 --> 04:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
remaining funds that were allocated for
 
04:00:11.830 --> 04:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the commission shouldn't
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
return to the education trust fund
 
04:00:16.950 --> 04:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
and it's uh that simple their work is
 
04:00:19.750 --> 04:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
done and uh we should
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
move on with whatever action
 
04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
school plumbing is going to be taking
 
04:00:27.269 --> 04:00:27.279 align:start position:0%

04:00:55.030 --> 04:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
welcome back to education mr dr ladd
 
04:00:56.150 --> 04:00:56.160 align:start position:0%

administrators association
 
04:01:01.510 --> 04:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hobson for the
 
04:01:03.750 --> 04:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is carl lab

executive director of the new hampshire
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
i understand that representative
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli thinks that the the work of the
 
04:01:16.550 --> 04:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
commission is completed
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe that that is
 
04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily true
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
there is still
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
an outstanding question about what's
 
04:01:26.070 --> 04:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
happening with
 
04:01:28.389 --> 04:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
education funding in our state
 
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the commission's work
 
04:01:33.910 --> 04:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
remains relevant and important to the
 
04:01:33.920 --> 04:01:35.030 align:start position:0%
remains relevant and important to the
field

04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
field
 
04:01:37.510 --> 04:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
until some some of those questions are
 
04:01:37.520 --> 04:01:38.870 align:start position:0%
until some some of those questions are
resolved

04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
04:01:40.870 --> 04:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
by the legislature
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
which they have not been as of yet so i
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
would i would urge
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%

04:01:48.389 --> 04:01:48.399 align:start position:0%

04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%

if you can believe it is the
oh

04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%

thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
very much president hobson um i just
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
want to very briefly uh
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
just say basically the same thing that a
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
doctor led just said that the
 
04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
commission's work is not finished and we
 
04:02:46.710 --> 04:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
should uh continue its work i'm
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly how significant the
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
funds are but we in the legislature
 
04:02:53.269 --> 04:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
we're not in having to spend our own
 
04:02:56.070 --> 04:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
money on things and this is a very uh
 
04:02:57.910 --> 04:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
this report obviously
 
04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
um leveraged a lot of a lot of resources
 
04:03:02.150 --> 04:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we didn't pay for and that's
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
probably somebody else is paying for
 
04:03:05.670 --> 04:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
like um
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
one this first came to my attention you
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
talked about the uh
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
the permanent commission the study and
 
04:03:11.600 --> 04:03:12.389 align:start position:0%
the permanent commission the study and
um

04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
and they referred to report which was
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
what has been issued by january 10 2021
 
04:03:18.150 --> 04:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
and usually
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
nobody can tell if those reports have
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
been filed i have no idea where to find
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
most of them this one actually
 
04:03:26.469 --> 04:03:26.479 align:start position:0%
was finished early in the december 1st
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
2020 um actually only
 
04:03:30.790 --> 04:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
only three months
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
only three months after the original
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
deadline which was september 1st so even
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic and everything
 
04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
happened the committee
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
met many many times presumably by zoom i
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was by zoom and uh
 
04:03:45.429 --> 04:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
and they did get a use of resources as i
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
said of many other agencies apparently
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
the carson school of unh like this
 
04:03:48.880 --> 04:03:49.830 align:start position:0%
the carson school of unh like this
report

04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:03:51.750 --> 04:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
unlike any unlike just about the any
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
other study committee you can actually
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
find a report online without any trouble
 
04:03:56.950 --> 04:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
you just
 
04:03:58.150 --> 04:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
just takes a very minimal amount of
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
googling um also the agendas of all the
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
meetings and all the documents submitted
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
all that stuff is online which is
 
04:04:05.910 --> 04:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
usually not the case for study committee
 
04:04:05.920 --> 04:04:07.189 align:start position:0%
usually not the case for study committee
usually

04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
usually
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know there's that
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
this bill at the boy
 
04:04:13.269 --> 04:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
there's a boilerplate language at the
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
end of rsa193 and how they're fighting
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
with the senate clerk house clerk and
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
state library and um
 
04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
i tried to just for last i decided to
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
log on to the state library to see like
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
where all the other study committee
 
04:04:26.150 --> 04:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
reports are they're probably in their
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
physical form somewhere in the library
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
slip over to concord and risk catching
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
covet and all that but
 
04:04:34.389 --> 04:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
they're not online except well except a
 
04:04:37.590 --> 04:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
very few of them maybe are collected by
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
somebody else and donate to the library
 
04:04:40.790 --> 04:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
so this is a
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
very nice study committee it's uh
 
04:04:45.269 --> 04:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
but whoever however this is funded
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a lot more funding
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
than the study committees usually get
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
i applaud the chair who's
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
of current event education revenue luna
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
and the many other people who worked on
 
04:04:55.960 --> 04:04:55.970 align:start position:0%
the report and um
 
04:04:55.970 --> 04:04:57.429 align:start position:0%
the report and um
[Music]

04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
so i i think i think the commission's
 
04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
work is not finished the general court
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
has not addressed the recommendations um
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
i have no idea when they're going to
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
recommend them um i'm not exactly
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not necessarily optimistic that
 
04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
we'll pass a
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
a budgeted bill by the deadline i think
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to attend a resolution so
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
the minimum uh you know
 
04:05:18.150 --> 04:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
and even if we
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
do do that in time that's uh
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
04:05:23.830 --> 04:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's not till uh june 30th and i think
 
04:05:23.840 --> 04:05:25.110 align:start position:0%
that's not till uh june 30th and i think
the

04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
work will continue for more than 60 days
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
after june 30th they have a notice on
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
their website which once again you can
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
see even the future meetings when it's
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
hard to find out but they have a couple
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
of zoom forums scheduled uh
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and a couple weeks from now and
 
04:05:39.510 --> 04:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
they have a variety of other activities
 
04:05:41.510 --> 04:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
so i think uh
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
so i think i think we should keep keep
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
the law the way it is we should keep the
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
committee commission keep whatever
 
04:05:50.150 --> 04:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
funding it has which i can't imagine
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's a huge amount um and it continues
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
work and i might also add
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
i know when i saw the bill the original
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
bill 2019 then revised in 2020 i did
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
wonder like uh
 
04:06:03.990 --> 04:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
what about the broad-based sales and
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
income tax but uh that was
 
04:06:07.990 --> 04:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
not specifically included by the
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee's charge but it uh wasn't
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned either they did specifically
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
mention the properties act and they did
 
04:06:13.439 --> 04:06:14.870 align:start position:0%
mention the properties act and they did
uh

04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
they did respect political reality that
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
anything involves a broad base you know
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
that avoiding a broad-based sales or
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
income taxes much higher prices and even
 
04:06:23.429 --> 04:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
higher priority than educating our
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
students so um
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
so they they respected that and they i
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
mean in all fairness so they did suggest
 
04:06:31.269 --> 04:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
some fundamental changes in how the
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
property taxes in our state are of
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
course been collected and that that
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
could be a problem but still they
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
they did it within the uh
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
boundaries this legislator has set
 
04:06:43.349 --> 04:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
itself for uh for decades i think even
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
since my
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
even since back when my father served in
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
the late 1970s so i thank the committee
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
for its work i think this bill is
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and frankly a little bit of
 
04:06:54.389 --> 04:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
an insult to all the hard work that was
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
put into it so i would um
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
i would urge you to uh
 
04:07:00.550 --> 04:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
let the commission continue until we
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually address that problem and
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh hopefully we'll address it
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
at least partially why whenever we can
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
pass a budget so that's uh
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's what i had to say so
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i could take questions but i
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
think you probably uh
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
want to move on the other items on your
 
04:07:18.150 --> 04:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
agenda so thank you
 
04:07:20.830 --> 04:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
04:07:22.880 --> 04:07:25.030 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
representative

04:07:25.030 --> 04:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:27.030 --> 04:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative horgan for taking my
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
question uh you've been in the
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
legislature a long time longer than i
 
04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
have and i was just wondering uh is this
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
a common thing that happens is this
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
something that uh you know that people
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
put through bills to stop a commission
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
um like
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
cut it off at the
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
at the end like this
 
04:07:53.110 --> 04:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
well not i know i'm speaking only as one
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
member of the uh
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
one member of the minority caucus i'm
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
not speaking even for them or anybody
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
but myself but i i i don't recall ever
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
seeing this um that seems like a
 
04:08:07.429 --> 04:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
pretty unusual situation especially
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
this is a kitty that was taken more
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
seriously than a lot of them the only
 
04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
one that i remember being taken that
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
seriously was one about the uh
 
04:08:16.870 --> 04:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
was one about the death penalty that we
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
had uh i don't know
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
sometime around 2000 i think lee was
 
04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
during my first term so and
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
well this is a good or bad thing but it
 
04:08:25.279 --> 04:08:26.150 align:start position:0%
well this is a good or bad thing but it
uh

04:08:26.150 --> 04:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:27.110 --> 04:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
took us
 
04:08:28.950 --> 04:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
several more sessions before we actually
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
addressed that issue so you know this is
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
like pretty unusual like cutting off
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
study committee before its work is done
 
04:08:36.150 --> 04:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
even though
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
even the report has been filed and as i
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
said it's unusual to actually be able to
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
find it that easily on fine and
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
it was actually filed ahead of deadline
 
04:08:45.269 --> 04:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
i think this is unusual
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:51.429 --> 04:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:08:54.150 --> 04:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative oregon for taking my
 
04:08:54.160 --> 04:08:55.189 align:start position:0%
representative oregon for taking my
question

04:08:55.189 --> 04:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh there are those who feel that the the
 
04:09:01.510 --> 04:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
commission its report are inherently
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
flawed and compromised due to the
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
perception that
 
04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
the commission's composition included
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much like-minded established
 
04:09:14.790 --> 04:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
education establishment folks who
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
had similar uh world views for example
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
five of the six
 
04:09:21.189 --> 04:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
legislators in the commission of the
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
same party so the question is those
 
04:09:27.830 --> 04:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
concerns have any validity in your
 
04:09:27.840 --> 04:09:29.030 align:start position:0%
concerns have any validity in your
uh

04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:30.550 --> 04:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
well i think
 
04:09:32.070 --> 04:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
as far as i know the individuals on the
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee the legislative members are
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
all very fair-minded people um even
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
though some of them had
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
even though there wasn't necessarily
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
even a number of d's and arts so i'm not
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
a i
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
i certainly have immense amount of
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
respect for all the individuals on the
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
committee and all the rest of the hard
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
work so i mean this uh
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
the study commission is just a view of
 
04:09:52.870 --> 04:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
the people who worked on this
 
04:09:54.150 --> 04:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that we're never going
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
to solve completely but i i i think it's
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think i think it's a good
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
report and you can either uh you can
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
choose to
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
you can we can we're all free to uh you
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
know implement the parts that we think
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
we're like and to not implement the
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
parts we don't agree with so that's uh
 
04:10:10.950 --> 04:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
not really
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
no study committee is ever gonna if it
 
04:10:12.960 --> 04:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
no study committee is ever gonna if it
does

04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't work it's gonna put out a
 
04:10:17.349 --> 04:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
report that everyone's gonna agree with
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
and they also the final document that
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
was issued
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
over a month ahead of schedule on
 
04:10:26.150 --> 04:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
december 1st uh 2020 does include about
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
25 pages of uh you know sort of
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
dissenting reports from from uh from the
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
activity members
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's about all i have to say about
 
04:10:35.910 --> 04:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
that i'm not necessarily saying
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
everything is correct
 
04:10:40.469 --> 04:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
and none of it's correct but
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
i still think uh don't think i'm just
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
saying i'm just supporting continuing
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
continuing the effort for at least a
 
04:10:46.080 --> 04:10:46.870 align:start position:0%
continuing the effort for at least a
little

04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
at least which would probably be at
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
least for the rest of the year so thanks
 
04:10:53.429 --> 04:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative thompson do you have a
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you mr chair and um
 
04:10:57.510 --> 04:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you rap morgan for taking my
 
04:10:57.520 --> 04:10:58.389 align:start position:0%
thank you rap morgan for taking my
question

04:10:58.389 --> 04:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:10:58.399 --> 04:10:59.670 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:01.750 --> 04:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if the committee has
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
already issued a report
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh with their findings what work is left
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
04:11:09.429 --> 04:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
well um
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm not the person i was
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
not on the committee i actually
 
04:11:15.110 --> 04:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
i think i zoomed in to only a handful of
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
meetings briefly but um well it says uh
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
the work is continuing and it's
 
04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
apparently leveraging as i said outside
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
funding this is certainly
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is a lot more extensive and a lot
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
more technological you know a lot more
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
sophisticated than what
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
a regular study committees do so they do
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
have like some community forums and
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
other activities and also just
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
specifically says um
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
the final report is not quite the end of
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
the process so in this case uh the
 
04:11:43.110 --> 04:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
commission has activities scheduled for
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
after that which is um
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
until and when the general court
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
addresses his recommendations and um
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
obviously they'll never be addressed to
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's satisfaction but presumably
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
when and if we ever pass a budget
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
trailer bill and i'm i'm personally
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
pessimistic given that we didn't even
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
see the first draft of the budget bill
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
until like
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's the uh march 2nd i think so even
 
04:12:05.189 --> 04:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's all we're already three weeks
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
behind schedule in that process but
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it will be addressed in some
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
way by the time we actually pass some uh
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't pass the budget so that's um
 
04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
and then so that
 
04:12:18.150 --> 04:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
probably takes us pretty far into this
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
year but i think you know
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
cutting it off too much too much for now
 
04:12:25.110 --> 04:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
like as or as of whenever we pass it
 
04:12:27.110 --> 04:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
which might be early as we can pass this
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
is march 31st i'm getting off into the
 
04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
weed here of course but like i think uh
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
you know terminated on march terminate
 
04:12:35.110 --> 04:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
this on march 31st i think it's just
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
massively premature so that's just my
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
opinion so i'm really i'm not the expert
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
on the work of the community that others
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
can discuss that amongst yourselves
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
since there were some members of the
 
04:12:47.670 --> 04:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
committee on the standing committee here
 
04:12:47.680 --> 04:12:48.389 align:start position:0%
committee on the standing committee here
that

04:12:48.389 --> 04:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:48.399 --> 04:12:49.269 align:start position:0%
that
that

04:12:49.269 --> 04:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't have taken questions
 
04:12:52.150 --> 04:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
from but i guess i'll take some more if
 
04:12:52.160 --> 04:12:53.189 align:start position:0%
from but i guess i'll take some more if
anybody

04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for representing
 
04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
oregon are there further questions for
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
martin thank you very much well thank
 
04:13:04.960 --> 04:13:08.950 align:start position:0%
martin thank you very much well thank
you

04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:08.960 --> 04:13:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see anyone else scheduled to
 
04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
testify nobody's got their hand raised
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.710 --> 04:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes just a question of the chair
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
on um on house bill 464 and i just want
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
to um take a look at it while i'm
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
asking the the question but um but where
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
the where the um the statues is amended
 
04:13:36.720 --> 04:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
the where the um the statues is amended
um

04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding is um
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
that would not affect uh
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
things like what representative horrigan
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
was talking about which is maintenance
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
of the commission's website
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
which under contract is to be maintained
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
for five years by the kharsi school at
 
04:13:56.720 --> 04:13:58.790 align:start position:0%
for five years by the kharsi school at
unh

04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
unh
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
due to the collection of materials that
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
was there and the investment made by the
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so i was just
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could confirm that
 
04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
yes i will um that
 
04:14:12.309 --> 04:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
that that was not part of
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's not how it's been done
 
04:14:16.870 --> 04:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
the commission report is a commission
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
report just like any other commission
 
04:14:20.830 --> 04:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
report we've had set up by this
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
legislature um currently it's uh being
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
handled through rc seeing that we that
 
04:14:29.670 --> 04:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
has been part of the support system
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
which that commission had
 
04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
and using for that half a million
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
dollars for it
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
so uh everything
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
is being handled in accordance with the
 
04:14:42.070 --> 04:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
way the program is set up and i have no
 
04:14:44.229 --> 04:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
problem with that uh representative
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
are they ready for the numbers
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead please
 
04:14:53.520 --> 04:14:54.870 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead please
um

04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
so we have eight
 
04:14:58.229 --> 04:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
in support
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
29 opposed
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
zero neutral and two tests
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay did everybody get those numbers
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm going to close the
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
hearing for hd 464.
 
04:15:16.239 --> 04:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
hearing for hd 464.
um

04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the next uh hearing is scheduled to
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
start at
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
1 30.
 
04:15:32.149 --> 04:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.159 --> 04:15:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
wait

04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
i do not plan on the second bills today
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
just so
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
all can understand that yes
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
so that may help some make their plans i
 
04:15:48.870 --> 04:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't want people
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:54.070 --> 04:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
cornell house
 
04:15:56.149 --> 04:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
represent cornell i'd like to make a
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
motion or a request whatever it should
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
be called um
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about the amendment
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
to 182 there seemed to be
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
different answers to whether velax is
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
accepted or not
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to ask the department of
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
education for the list of um schools who
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
actually have
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
rejected velax
 
04:16:20.880 --> 04:16:22.309 align:start position:0%
rejected velax
classes

04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
classes
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
um before we execute this i i would
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know dr ladd and bridie bellamy are
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
the principals and the um
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
the superintendents associations are
 
04:16:34.149 --> 04:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
in their recognition
 
04:16:36.560 --> 04:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
in their recognition
recollection

04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
recollection
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
there really aren't any that are
 
04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
rejected but then we hear numerous times
 
04:16:45.349 --> 04:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
in testimony that the department of ed
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
says that
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
velax is rejected from schools so i
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
would like to know you know where the
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
department of ed is getting that
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
information which schools are rejecting
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
and how many there are
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
represent cornell you may ask them
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
nobody's preventing you from doing that
 
04:17:04.319 --> 04:17:06.790 align:start position:0%
nobody's preventing you from doing that
okay

04:17:06.790 --> 04:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a few moments here
 
04:17:13.680 --> 04:17:14.950 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a few moments here
um

04:17:14.950 --> 04:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd like to briefly
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
discuss is that we do have a
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's uh scheduled to meet
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
on um
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
this friday
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
to look at the post-secondary merger um
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
in my way of looking at where we are in
 
04:17:37.349 --> 04:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
education a very very important issue
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
um how we uh manage our academic and
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
financial affairs and addressing
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education is extremely
 
04:17:45.920 --> 04:17:47.269 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education is extremely
important

04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:17:47.279 --> 04:17:48.389 align:start position:0%
important
um

04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
if anybody here has not had an
 
04:17:53.429 --> 04:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at hb2
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
and to look at the language within hb2
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
which addresses this i encourage you to
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:18:02.950 --> 04:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
um the committee is scheduled
 
04:18:02.960 --> 04:18:04.070 align:start position:0%
um the committee is scheduled
uh

04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
and at this point i have not changed any
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the times i know i've heard from
 
04:18:09.429 --> 04:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
several people that
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
are in merrimack county and there's a
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
conflict with the 10 o'clock meeting
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
with the county delegation on that same
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
day that was unknown when we went and
 
04:18:21.670 --> 04:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
scheduled it i also have dr ed mckay
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
scheduled to speak already at techwalk
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
on friday morning
 
04:18:29.110 --> 04:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
dr mckay is a fountain of information
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i i encourage um anybody that's in
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
this committee's welcome welcome to
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
listen and and and
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
as we do in many of our subcommittee
 
04:18:43.680 --> 04:18:44.870 align:start position:0%
as we do in many of our subcommittee
meetings

04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
where we have uh
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
participants assigned and uh it's not a
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
closed situation at all
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
um we've had several reports which have
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
been uh provided to us uh one by several
 
04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
reports by oliver ford who was past
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
president of the university of
 
04:19:05.510 --> 04:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts lowell and went through
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
this with little technical institute uh
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
and doing some merging there
 
04:19:12.550 --> 04:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
i've read a report that deals with uh
 
04:19:14.309 --> 04:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
mergers in several other states
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
connecticut minnesota alaska i'm very
 
04:19:19.429 --> 04:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with the merger in alaska which
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
created huge problems
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh although alaska is a very different
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
state and has many different cultural
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
aspects and geographic
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
distances are something that can't be
 
04:19:33.429 --> 04:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
compared to new hampshire they should be
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
compared to the entire country
 
04:19:39.269 --> 04:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
so by reading that they come up with and
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
they the report's been written by
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
notable new england associations
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
10 or so real concerns
 
04:19:51.750 --> 04:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
elements that must be addressed and so
 
04:19:55.189 --> 04:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
what we will be doing as a committee
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
on that first meeting this coming friday
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
he's working with ted
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
trying to identify these broad
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
broad themes
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
which need to be conveyed to the finance
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
people when they're looking at this
 
04:20:09.510 --> 04:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
issue of merger
 
04:20:11.110 --> 04:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
whether it can be achieved in one year
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
two year three years um what are the
 
04:20:13.680 --> 04:20:15.510 align:start position:0%
two year three years um what are the
ramifications

04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
the consequences that really are not
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
known about at this point in time have
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
been properly dealt with before we've
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
done that giant leap
 
04:20:28.309 --> 04:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
because this will uh
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
tear apart the press and structure we
 
04:20:33.030 --> 04:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
have for how we run our post-secondary
 
04:20:35.110 --> 04:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
institutions the
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
trustees of the community college system
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
at the university system will be done
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
away with and there'll be a new
 
04:20:44.550 --> 04:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
overarching trustee board of 15 people
 
04:20:44.560 --> 04:20:45.429 align:start position:0%
overarching trustee board of 15 people
um

04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:48.389 --> 04:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
and uh that is of that one third will be
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor the other two
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
thirds uh from the
 
04:20:55.110 --> 04:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
institutions no
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
so um i encourage folks if you have a
 
04:21:00.309 --> 04:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
moment to tune in if you don't have a
 
04:21:01.750 --> 04:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
copy of the
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
zoom link for that i'm asking now that
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
jennifer who's listening that we would
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
also ensure that that link is provided
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
to all education committee members so
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
you can hop online and and listen
 
04:21:13.600 --> 04:21:14.469 align:start position:0%
you can hop online and and listen
and

04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:14.479 --> 04:21:15.349 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:17.110 --> 04:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
observe where we're going
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
once again this is a real important
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
issue unfortunately we don't have the
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
time to make this a real proper study
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to just come up with some
 
04:21:26.159 --> 04:21:27.590 align:start position:0%
we're going to just come up with some
overarching

04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
overarching
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh facts
 
04:21:30.790 --> 04:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we can find and provide
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
that fiscal finance committee
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
and with they can
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
take and run with that information
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
so i see a hand up there is that you
 
04:21:41.199 --> 04:21:44.790 align:start position:0%
so i see a hand up there is that you
mary

04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes it is i'm sorry mr chair um we come
 
04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
division two of finance we're also
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
meeting um with the university system
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the community college is that the
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
same meeting or are these two separate
 
04:22:00.550 --> 04:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
meetings i believe there are two
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
separate meetings uh i've been asked by
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh karen humberger
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
to help provide this policy information
 
04:22:11.670 --> 04:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm figuring it's best that it comes
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
from policy people
 
04:22:14.000 --> 04:22:14.950 align:start position:0%
from policy people
here

04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:22:17.110 --> 04:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
and we have some knowledgeable people on
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
this committee that have backgrounds
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
in this arena so i think we can offer
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
something to them even though we don't
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
have that much time
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:34.149 --> 04:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
um mr chair
 
04:22:34.159 --> 04:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
um mr chair
yes

04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
so so i think what what representative
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
heath was just highlighting was that
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
finance division two is also meeting
 
04:22:43.830 --> 04:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
friday at ten o'clock in the morning
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's the same time yes um with with the
 
04:22:49.349 --> 04:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
um community college system and the
 
04:22:53.429 --> 04:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
university system yes correct yes
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and we also have a person's
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
schedule come in
 
04:22:58.319 --> 04:22:59.189 align:start position:0%
schedule come in
um

04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:02.469 --> 04:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
that uh that has knowledge on what's
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
going on with these uh with the credit
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
and with
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
the combining merging of these systems
 
04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the new england year on the
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
following friday but hopefully at this
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
friday meeting working
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves and working with them
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
we can come out
 
04:23:21.670 --> 04:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
with a short list of folks that might be
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
able to come in and also offer us some
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
support and trying to arrive at the end
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
zone here
 
04:23:31.670 --> 04:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
right i certainly you know i i recognize
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
what you're saying rick that there's
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's certainly an urgency and a
 
04:23:35.520 --> 04:23:36.790 align:start position:0%
there's certainly an urgency and a
timeliness

04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
timeliness
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
um you know of this so so uh
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
i i do hope though we'll be able to have
 
04:23:44.790 --> 04:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
some representatives from the um from
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
the the two systems to at least monitor
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
this um you know well obviously both um
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
both um meetings
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
the community college system did
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
complete a recent study
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can find the author of
 
04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
that study
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
that uh write that
 
04:24:04.800 --> 04:24:05.590 align:start position:0%
that uh write that
and

04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
you know and and
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
bring some folks in from the at this
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
point we're not going to be able to have
 
04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
somebody come from in all seven
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
institutions but we want a
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative of those seven whether it
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
be susan bjork
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
or it be it um somebody that's uh
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
involved in that current study
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the n-chem study
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm talking about
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so and there are some great uh uh
 
04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
points that are mentioned in that that
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at that maybe
 
04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the uh
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
the the elements or components that
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
finance might want to consider
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
i know that they're having the other
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
side other uh information provided to
 
04:24:47.279 --> 04:24:48.070 align:start position:0%
side other uh information provided to
them

04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:24:49.990 --> 04:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
however sometimes it's helpful for
 
04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
groups like that cliff notes that we
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:56.479 --> 04:24:57.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
um so once again put down 10 o'clock um
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
i recognize there's a conflict with the
 
04:25:03.840 --> 04:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
i recognize there's a conflict with the
delegation

04:25:05.110 --> 04:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
04:25:08.229 --> 04:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
merrimack to the county however
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
i just feel very uncomfortable where we
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
are right now with such limited time to
 
04:25:14.229 --> 04:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
start changing and playing with that
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
date and also playing with dr mckay
 
04:25:20.469 --> 04:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
which is finally offered to give us some
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
his oversight our
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
understandings of what we need to be
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
considering looking at in terms of
 
04:25:27.359 --> 04:25:33.030 align:start position:0%
considering looking at in terms of
merger

04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll be starting this out
 
04:25:44.309 --> 04:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
whereas i'm presenting this next bill
 
04:25:48.030 --> 04:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be asking our
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative to chair this particular
 
04:25:50.800 --> 04:25:52.389 align:start position:0%
representative to chair this particular
meeting

04:25:52.389 --> 04:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:26:14.070 --> 04:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay i think it's uh
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
that time
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
1 30
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
which is the scheduled uh time
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're opening the hearing on house bill
 
04:26:52.800 --> 04:26:54.550 align:start position:0%
we're opening the hearing on house bill
198

04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
198
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i will do that
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
04:26:58.399 --> 04:26:59.429 align:start position:0%
at this time
and

04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:01.510 --> 04:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
given the number of people
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
who have signed up to testify
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
and time
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we have a
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
recessed bill still to
 
04:27:10.000 --> 04:27:10.830 align:start position:0%
recessed bill still to
deal

04:27:10.830 --> 04:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
deal
 
04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
with i would like to limit a time to two
 
04:27:17.269 --> 04:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
minutes for uh speakers
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
and uh ask committee members to
 
04:27:20.720 --> 04:27:21.750 align:start position:0%
and uh ask committee members to
limit

04:27:21.750 --> 04:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
limit
 
04:27:21.760 --> 04:27:22.870 align:start position:0%
limit
their

04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
questions especially follow-ups um if we
 
04:27:25.439 --> 04:27:27.269 align:start position:0%
questions especially follow-ups um if we
could

04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:27:28.389 --> 04:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair mr chair
 
04:27:30.960 --> 04:27:31.750 align:start position:0%
mr chair mr chair
yes

04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
um could i just make a request that when
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
you limit um
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
people's testimony that you at least
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
give them a 30-second warning and and
 
04:27:43.110 --> 04:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
say that you're where it's going to be
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a 30-second
 
04:27:44.800 --> 04:27:45.910 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a 30-second
warning

04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
warning
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
um you know somewhere on the screen
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
i just find it very rude to just
 
04:27:55.590 --> 04:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
mute them so without a warning so and i
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
know representative leon usually does
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
that quite well um i'm just hoping we
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
have that and that it's um some place
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
where the people that are testifying
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
know that it's going to be
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
they're able to see that thank you
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
i can do that for you um if everyone can
 
04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
i'll let everyone know when there's 30
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
seconds left um you look uh i don't know
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's very dark in your screen um but
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
give it a shot
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
can you see this
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
where's my screen
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
can you see that yes that's good thank
 
04:28:38.309 --> 04:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
you that's what i'll do
 
04:28:41.189 --> 04:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
i agree i feel like cutting people off
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
but it's just there's no way to you know
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
i would also request that
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
if people have written testimony
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
that they state it at the beginning
 
04:28:56.469 --> 04:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
and that they summarize their written
 
04:28:56.479 --> 04:28:58.710 align:start position:0%
and that they summarize their written
testimony

04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:29:07.510 --> 04:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:10.950 --> 04:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
just a a courtesy um
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
i find i find it very difficult when
 
04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
people come and wait to speak on any
 
04:29:15.199 --> 04:29:15.990 align:start position:0%
people come and wait to speak on any
issue

04:29:15.990 --> 04:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
and then they find out right before they
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
open the hearing they're going to give
 
04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
them two minutes
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
i mean whatever time you're going to
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh mandate and i understand this is a
 
04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
controversial bill but it really would
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
have been nice to announce during the
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
day that i'm not hearing it'll be two
 
04:29:31.990 --> 04:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
minutes or three minutes so these people
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
could plan appropriately it just seems
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
like a that's a hell of a lot of time to
 
04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
waste you wait around six hours to talk
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
for two minutes so it says a courtesy
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
from the house if we know we have a bill
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
we gonna where you're gonna limit
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um then it'd be nice if you
 
04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
guys anyone told in advance
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
04:29:54.870 --> 04:29:54.880 align:start position:0%

04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today to speak on behalf of
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
hp 198
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
relative to exception to the opportunity
 
04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
for an education without
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
and in no way do i want uh to convey
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
in my testimony that i'm contrary to
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
354a colon 28 gap in
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
public education without discrimination
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
when we look at 354 there are exceptions
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
for various uh other categories within
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
this and it's my opinion that
 
04:30:40.149 --> 04:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
we need to be looking at the possible
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
exception and dealing with the topic
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to go ahead and address
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
at this moment
 
04:30:47.429 --> 04:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
if an act that this bill will prevent
 
04:30:49.349 --> 04:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
biological males who claim to be
 
04:30:52.149 --> 04:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
transgender transgender from competing
 
04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
against biological females in the high
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
school and post-secondary in scholastic
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
and strategic athletics
 
04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
the bill further supports congress's
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
intended purpose of creating athletic
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities for girls as enacted in
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%

48 years ago
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
his response believe that rsa 354 a a
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
colon 28 the opportunity for public
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
education without discrimination will be
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
strengthened with this exception
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
pertaining to high school and
 
04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
post-secondary sports
 
04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
this is in keeping with title ix and
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
intended to preserve and provide
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
limit in sports
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
title ix was created to advance
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities for women not biological
 
04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
men who claim to be with
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
for title ix purposes sex means
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
biological sex
 
04:31:43.429 --> 04:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
boys generally tend to be bigger
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
taller stronger and faster than girls
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
and jump higher and straight balls with
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
greater force
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
all which gives boys an advantage over
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
girls supports which schools have
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
traditionally reserved exclusively for
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
girls in sports such as field hockey and
 
04:31:58.560 --> 04:31:59.830 align:start position:0%

04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
female track and field
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
athletes might be considered elite when
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
compared to other females but their
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
running times or jumping or throwing
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
marks often pale in comparison to those
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
of their male counterparts
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
in sports like basketball or soccer
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
a tall strong fast athletic girl who
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
dominates against other girls would
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
likely be seriously outclassed when
 
04:32:27.630 --> 04:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
competing against boys
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
physiological differences between sexes
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
do exist
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
from a competitive standpoint males were
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
permitted to compete with girls for
 
04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
positions on girls sports teams
 
04:32:41.670 --> 04:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
due to average physiological differences
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
males would displace females to a
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
substantial extent
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
in respect to high school level
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
athletics open competition and would in
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
all probability relegate the majority of
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
females to second class positions as
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
bench warmers or spectators
 
04:33:00.630 --> 04:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
if it therefore stands to reason by
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
letting boys even those who claim to be
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
girls to compete on girls teams
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
violates the equal protections clause
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
and denies girls athletic opportunities
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
provided under title 9.
 
04:33:15.910 --> 04:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
without a gender-based classification
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
built upon biological gender competitive
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
sports there would be a substantial risk
 
04:33:23.590 --> 04:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
that boys participate in girls programs
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
would dominate those programs and deny
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
girls an equal opportunity to
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
participate in inner splastic events if
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%
an athlete's mere claim that he is
 
04:33:35.590 --> 04:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
female or vice versa takes precedent
 
04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
over or at least is equal are given
 
04:33:41.590 --> 04:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
equal weight with biology then the term
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
sex is used in typecast and title ix is
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
rendered useless interpreting the title
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
ix to require that high schools shop and
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
rent transgender athletes to compete on
 
04:33:55.750 --> 04:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
whichever athletic teams match an
 
04:33:57.269 --> 04:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
individual's self-proclaimed gender
 
04:33:59.910 --> 04:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
identity would in fact disadvantage
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
biological women and undermine the
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
intent and purpose of title ix
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
if the school has teams available for
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
persons of his biological gender then
 
04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
denial to participation on girls teams
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
is not discrimination in fact if a
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
biological male is allowed to
 
04:34:20.150 --> 04:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
participate on a girl's team in this

situation

04:34:21.429 --> 04:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
it is the girls who are being
 
04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
in summary the disregard of
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
physiological differences between boys
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
and girls most often results in
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
disadvantages and endangers girls on the
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
athletic field
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
permitting non-biological girls
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
participation in girls athletics is
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%
contrary to legitimate and important
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
government interest in correcting fast
 
04:34:46.551 --> 04:34:46.561 align:start position:0%

identity that does not match their

biological gender would hinder and quite

possibly reverse the steady increase

at the highest collegiate levels in this

country i am disturbed that our

04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
opens at puberty is both permanent and
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
unabridged and unbridgeable
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%

the biological advances men
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
possess larger hearts lungs and bones
 
04:36:08.070 --> 04:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
greater bone density more oxygenated

based on 2018 data nearly 300 high
 
04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
school boys in the u.s alone could beat
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
that mark
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
the spectacular records and achievements
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
that jackie joyner althea gibson and
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
willman rue of rudolph would never have
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
been achieved had the world pitted their
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
bodies against men yet here we are today
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
hearing a bill that if not pass could
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
lead to the end of girls sports and
 
04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
significantly reverse all the wonderful
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
gains directly associated with title ix
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you um and thank you for listening
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
to my presentation
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
and to expedite uh time right here i i'm
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
forgo the question and answer period and
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
let other folks who want to test why i
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity thank you thank
 
04:37:16.400 --> 04:37:17.990 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity thank you thank
you

04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
so with that um
 
04:37:22.150 --> 04:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
we'll just go
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
right down the list of people
 
04:37:28.709 --> 04:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
so um i do have uh representative tim
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
corrigan it's our practice to let
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
representatives go there correct
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
go ahead mr uh representative
 
04:37:44.390 --> 04:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i didn't realize i'd
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
be the first person to speak against
 
04:37:48.390 --> 04:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
this by representing timothy oregon and
 
04:37:50.470 --> 04:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
represents stratfor counties district
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
six to the towns of durham and madbury
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
and i'm so i strongly oppose this bill
 
04:37:56.230 --> 04:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
for a
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
basic premise of uh trans
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
women not really being women i just
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely disagree with um so that's uh
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
and i mean i'm aware of the fact that
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
men are
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
generally bigger and taller and stronger
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
than women i mean obviously there are
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
although there are some women who are
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
much taller than men especially me i'm
 
04:38:18.150 --> 04:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
only five six but uh i think
 
04:38:19.750 --> 04:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think this is something that should be
 
04:38:19.760 --> 04:38:20.551 align:start position:0%
i think this is something that should be
left

04:38:20.551 --> 04:38:20.561 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
to the uh you know the athletic
 
04:38:24.789 --> 04:38:24.799 align:start position:0%
sanctioning bodies the nhiaa has
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
what i think is fairly reasonable
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
provision that you have to be you know
 
04:38:31.590 --> 04:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
a young woman has to be living her life
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
as a woman for purposes other than just
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
athletic competition so there's more to
 
04:38:37.269 --> 04:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
it than just uh you know
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
saying you're a woman and going out and
 
04:38:40.949 --> 04:38:40.959 align:start position:0%
competing in a girls high school sport
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
or college sport and the other
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
competitions have the same thing i will
 
04:38:44.000 --> 04:38:44.869 align:start position:0%
competitions have the same thing i will
say

04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
um this is an issue that's been around
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
really as long as women are
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
participating for professional sports so
 
04:38:52.709 --> 04:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
even back you know
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
even back in 2030s or any woman excelled
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
was often suspected of you know expected
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
of you know being a uh what we now call
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
a trans you know trans female and uh
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
most of them
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
and most so but i don't think any of
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
them were deliberately doing that just
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
to gain assists and just because of who
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
they are they had a famous american
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
sprinter named stella walsh who
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually everybody except as a female
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
presented as a woman everybody you know
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
she was unequivocally a woman was even
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
married for several years and that she
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
turned out to
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
be what they call you know
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
intersex person so she was like
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know a combination of male and
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
female and they didn't find out until
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
she died and that's uh
 
04:39:36.869 --> 04:39:36.879 align:start position:0%
i mean that that's a that's a fact of
 
04:39:39.270 --> 04:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
life but uh women but you know she was
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
still a woman the other women who
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
competed in the sports are
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
also also women and you know so this is
 
04:39:46.470 --> 04:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is not as bad as what we have
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
in other states but
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
still a bad bill and it should be should
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
be itl then we should any case leave it
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe to the various um sports
 
04:39:56.550 --> 04:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
organizations which have their own
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
policies and uh will continue to have
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
their own policies even if we pull uh
 
04:40:01.440 --> 04:40:02.628 align:start position:0%
their own policies even if we pull uh
full

04:40:02.628 --> 04:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
full
 
04:40:05.110 --> 04:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
girl even if we like prohibit
 
04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
them from public school teams and
 
04:40:09.990 --> 04:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
finally this also
 
04:40:11.350 --> 04:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
also impacts you know some activities
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
which are mostly done by girls but which
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh case make boys participate in like
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
this might ban example boys from
 
04:40:19.270 --> 04:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
participating or young men participating
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
in high school or collegiate cheer teams
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
so that's um
 
04:40:23.040 --> 04:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
so that's um
this

04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a bad bill just create
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
more more hatred where there's already
 
04:40:29.670 --> 04:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
too much hatred so i urge the committee
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
to find this bill and expedient to
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislate um thanks
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
see none help we have represented
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.940 --> 04:40:47.950 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for taking
 
04:40:47.950 --> 04:40:49.430 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for taking
[Music]

04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
04:40:53.430 --> 04:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions if you were
 
04:40:53.440 --> 04:40:55.430 align:start position:0%
questions if you were
anywhere

04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
04:41:04.890 --> 04:41:04.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.900 --> 04:41:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're having a little trouble uh you
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
maybe you're trying without you know
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
maybe try a little bit better
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
um i mean i think i
 
04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
think i heard him maybe i think he's
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
asking for any
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
you know journey trans male who had
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
transitioned from being female and
 
04:41:25.350 --> 04:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
excelled in
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
actually um
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's happened i i
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
i do not know so but uh
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh certainly there are
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
certainly there are
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
trans trans men who start who were
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i know for example there is a
 
04:41:48.240 --> 04:41:49.590 align:start position:0%
i mean i know for example there is a
previous

04:41:49.590 --> 04:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
previous
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
when we had this bill which i guess was
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
in 2019 well similar bill in 2019 we did
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
have uh some uh
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
some some young men who were trans men
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
came in who did participate in support
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
something either question was uh
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
i'd like go oh
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
anybody who's transitioned from male to
 
04:42:12.070 --> 04:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
female um
 
04:42:14.230 --> 04:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
i yes there's been a number
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a lot of controversy over
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
that um i remember
 
04:42:20.310 --> 04:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
the only uh
 
04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
i do remember there's a female east
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
german athlete who did uh
 
04:42:25.990 --> 04:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
transition well there's also like here
 
04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
in the united states we have bruce
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
jenner who transitioned from male to
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
female that's now uh
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
now uh caitlyn jeff no ugly caitlyn
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
jenner i can't keep all those genders
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
straight i believe that's her name i
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
mean there was one you know there's a
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
east german
 
04:42:41.830 --> 04:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
triathlete who later trans with the
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
other way transitioned to males it
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen but i'm not uh
 
04:42:47.590 --> 04:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i don't know i'm not the expert on
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
it so probably uh
 
04:42:51.030 --> 04:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
you probably may have to do your own
 
04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
research on it before you decide which
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
way to
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
vote on the bill but that's uh
 
04:42:57.990 --> 04:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that's the best answer yeah
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:05.670 --> 04:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
next is milano
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
you've been promoted go ahead and uh
 
04:43:14.230 --> 04:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
hi members of the committee uh i want to
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh you all taking the time to
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
hear my testimony today my name is
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
paulana belkin i'm a rochester resident
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
and a city councilor here who is proud
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
to call new hampshire my home and i'm
 
04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
to hb 198.
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
in 2020 i authored a report titled the
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
case for lived quality in the classroom
 
04:43:36.868 --> 04:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
which was published by the aclu of new
 
04:43:39.750 --> 04:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that examined the adoption
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire school board
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
association's model trans policy jbab
 
04:43:46.150 --> 04:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
as well as new hampshire's history of
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
affirming trans identities mostly
 
04:43:48.160 --> 04:43:49.510 align:start position:0%
affirming trans identities mostly
students

04:43:49.510 --> 04:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
in preparing the report i spent most of
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
last year personally reading through and
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
analyzing about 196 public school and
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
charter school policies across new new
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire and a little bit of the bigger
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
picture of trans uh trans rights
 
04:44:02.638 --> 04:44:03.830 align:start position:0%
picture of trans uh trans rights
statewide

04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i'd like to just share a few
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
stats that i kind of took out of this
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
report in compiling it so over the past
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
six years 50 school districts across new
 
04:44:15.430 --> 04:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire have passed their own trans
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
student policy so these 50 school
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
districts they cover about 40 percent of
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
our state's total public school
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
enrollees so we have 40 percent of our
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
students are attending a school
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
where uh you know one of these 50 times
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
that that a school board came together
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
and identified the need for a trans
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
student policy 50 different times that a
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
community identified that need for
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
themselves and passed a policy
 
04:44:40.080 --> 04:44:41.110 align:start position:0%
themselves and passed a policy
um

04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:43.910 --> 04:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
two observations that i will elevate are
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
that there's uh there's a really great
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
geographic diversity amongst these
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
districts the first two districts to do
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
so were monroe
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
and epping um school districts as far
 
04:44:56.948 --> 04:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
north as ariel as far west as winchester
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
and keene as well as our schools are our
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
state's largest school districts nashua
 
04:45:03.430 --> 04:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
and manchester have all passed
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive transgender student
 
04:45:08.070 --> 04:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
policies that include athletics
 
04:45:10.868 --> 04:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
alton gilford nashua and manchester and
 
04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
muscoma valley all passed their policies
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
in the last year and a half and those
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
account for about 15 of our
 
04:45:19.270 --> 04:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
um of our state's public school
 
04:45:19.280 --> 04:45:20.868 align:start position:0%
um of our state's public school
enrollees

04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
enrollees
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
when mixed with the in 2010 the nhiaa
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
said that trans students have the right
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
and that there is a system of working
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
that out
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think that it's no mistake that 50
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
different communities the
 
04:45:36.150 --> 04:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
nhiaa and the new hampshire state
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
legislature many times over at this
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
point there have been so many bills and
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
updates to it have all arrived at trans
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
folks deserving full inclusion under the
 
04:45:45.040 --> 04:45:46.150 align:start position:0%
folks deserving full inclusion under the
law

04:45:46.150 --> 04:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:45:46.160 --> 04:45:47.030 align:start position:0%
law
um

04:45:47.030 --> 04:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know i also think that it's no
 
04:45:50.550 --> 04:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
mistake that not once has a complaint
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
been filed against a transgender athlete
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
here in the state of new hampshire and i
 
04:45:56.230 --> 04:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't think that it could be any more
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
clear that hb
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
198 is a solution in need of a problem
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
04:46:05.830 --> 04:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
please encourage you to join me in in uh
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%

members of the committee for taking my
 
04:46:40.708 --> 04:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
testimony today for the record my name
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
is sofia biandolilo i'm 14 i live in
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
manchester and i'm speaking today on
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire high school
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
democrats in strong opposition to hb198
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
um to address what one of the
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
representatives said i do have written
 
04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
testimony i will send it to the
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee after this um and if i had to
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
summarize it in one sentence i guess i
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
would say that everything in the bill
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
is based upon has been disproven and it
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
is openly discriminatory
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
um so there are two things implying this
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill's findings that i'd like to address
 
04:47:08.550 --> 04:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
um first is that single set of athletes
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
single sex athletics are rooted in
 
04:47:12.868 --> 04:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
biological differences between the sexes
 
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that is just not true the actual
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
origin of segregated sports is because
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
of the um prevailing scientific theory
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the 1800s which was that the human
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
body had a limited amount of energy and
 
04:47:25.830 --> 04:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
that if a woman who was menstruating
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
used any sort of mental energy um while
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
she was menstruating she could hurt
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
herself and that is why they were
 
04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
encouraged only to play recreational
 
04:47:35.670 --> 04:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
sports that required very little energy
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
and now we still separate women from
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
sports but it is completely arbitrary
 
04:47:40.390 --> 04:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
and it's not based on any real science
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
because obviously our theory of science
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
has evolved since then secondly the bill
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
implies that trans girls have some sort
 
04:47:48.070 --> 04:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
of inherent advantage over cis girls
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
which is also not true in 2017 sports
 
04:47:52.708 --> 04:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
medical did a comprehensive review of
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
all research and reporting on the
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
subject and they found that quote there
 
04:47:58.150 --> 04:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
is no direct or consistent research
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting transgender female
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
individuals have an athletic advantage
 
04:48:03.670 --> 04:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
at any stage of their transition and
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
that is exactly what the issue comes
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
down to the idea that trans girls have
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
an advantage totally overlooks the
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
entire purpose of medical transition
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
many trans athletes use hormone blockers
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
and or hormone replacement therapy which
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
lowers their testosterone to typical
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
levels for their gender this completely
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
eliminates whatever advantage we might
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
expect trans girls to have
 
04:48:20.400 --> 04:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
expect trans girls to have
hypothetically

04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
hypothetically
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
and to touch on my personal experience
 
04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of the new hampshire junior
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
roller derby team which is completely
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
co-ed our team is very diverse and
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
includes boys girls non-binary people
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
tall people strong people and all
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
different builds and variations within
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
biology this is not something that
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
hinders our ability to play but it makes
 
04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
the game more fun and makes skill more
 
04:48:42.310 --> 04:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
valuable and if a trans girl wanted to
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
enter our team we would welcome her with
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
open arms as every team should
 
04:48:47.910 --> 04:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion by singling out trans
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
girls and dividing them from their peers
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
we endorse transphobia hate bullying and
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
unproven science and we contribute to
 
04:48:55.110 --> 04:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
the already stressful experience of
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
navigating the world as trans in new
 
04:48:58.390 --> 04:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i urge the committee to
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
recommend itl on hb198 so as not to
 
04:49:02.550 --> 04:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
endorse open discrimination against
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
those most vulnerable in our communities
 
04:49:05.830 --> 04:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
and to protect trans girls and i thank
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:13.520 --> 04:49:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
reflective has her hand raised
 
04:49:18.000 --> 04:49:20.310 align:start position:0%
reflective has her hand raised
yes

04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:49:22.470 --> 04:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question is
 
04:49:24.948 --> 04:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
there any i loved your example of the
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
rollerblading is there any reason why we
 
04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
can't have more uh mixed gender sports
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
than we do right now which this bill is
 
04:49:36.550 --> 04:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
not against in any way
 
04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
and that would provide a place for
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
um i think that you are correct i think
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
that all sports should be co-ed um but
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
also i think with the situation where it
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
is right now when we do have sports that
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
are divided by gender we should let
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
people be on the appropriate teams
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
because they are divided
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:50:10.390 --> 04:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
next we have megan karen
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
welcome to education
 
04:50:15.990 --> 04:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
hello yes can you hear me okay
 
04:50:18.868 --> 04:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
great my name is megan karen of nashua
 
04:50:20.708 --> 04:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify in
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to this harmful bill um i was
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
raised here in in new hampshire and
 
04:50:28.708 --> 04:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
before i moved back i was the program
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
director for a non-profit in boston
 
04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
working with
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
youth who were either at risk for
 
04:50:37.030 --> 04:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
commercial sexual exploitation or were
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
being exploited at the time
 
04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
and many of these uh youth were trans
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
youth and experiencing homelessness
 
04:50:47.270 --> 04:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
and i'll never forget one client said
 
04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
some something that a client said to me
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
when i asked them what led them to
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
boston they said there was nothing for
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
me in new hampshire and i want that to
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
sink in
 
04:51:01.030 --> 04:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
this particular young person shared that
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
they would rather be experiencing
 
04:51:05.190 --> 04:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
homelessness in a city where they can
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
live as their authentic selves and have
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
access to resources
 
04:51:11.430 --> 04:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
than to be in a place where they felt
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
they were not welcome they were not
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
accepted nor were they valued new
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire is better this than this and
 
04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
our youth deserve better thank you very
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:43.110 --> 04:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh nice to see you all
 
04:51:44.948 --> 04:51:44.958 align:start position:0%

the committee
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
which uh i think sufficiently expresses
 
04:51:59.830 --> 04:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
my views on this bill i find this bill
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and onerous
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
and i would encourage the committee to
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
itl this bill
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for
 
04:52:13.190 --> 04:52:13.200 align:start position:0%

04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
i do not see any so
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%

04:52:48.390 --> 04:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
attorney with glbtq legal advocates and
 
04:52:51.990 --> 04:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
defenders um new england's go to lgbtq
 
04:52:54.150 --> 04:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
legal advocacy organization i'm also a
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licensed attorney although
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
i am based in boston um i'm emphatically
 
04:53:02.310 --> 04:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to hb 198 i've submitted
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
testimony to that effect but i'll go
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
through some oral points as quickly as
 
04:53:06.798 --> 04:53:08.230 align:start position:0%
through some oral points as quickly as
possible

04:53:08.230 --> 04:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
everyone here is concerned about
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
fairness and school sports programs
 
04:53:14.470 --> 04:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
there is no disagreement about that
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
we all also believe in educational
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities that must be available to
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
all students equally i'm going to try to
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit more about why hb
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
198 takes away from that goal and why it
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide any benefit to anyone
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
transgender girls play sports for the
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
same reason that any young people play
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
sports participation in sports provides
 
04:53:36.948 --> 04:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
necessary opportunities for young people
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
to develop critical life skills
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
including communication teamwork
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
self-discipline leadership confidence
 
04:53:46.390 --> 04:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
everybody benefits when these
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities are available equally to
 
04:53:50.788 --> 04:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
all students i spoke this morning in a
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
different hearing and i explained a
 
04:53:54.070 --> 04:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
little bit about who transgender people
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
are i made a key point in that hearing
 
04:53:58.628 --> 04:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
that it's imperative to the health and
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
well-being of all students to be
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
affirmed in their gender identity in all
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
aspects of their life at school this is
 
04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
true for transgender students and for
 
04:54:08.628 --> 04:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
non-transgender students that means that
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
during the school day students should be
 
04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
affirmed and it means the same for
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
after-school sports programs every
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
transgender student must be affirmed and
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
treated as a whole person
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh today's transgender students our
 
04:54:22.708 --> 04:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
future neighbors co-workers educators
 
04:54:24.310 --> 04:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
volunteers parents
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
and um all right well i see there's only
 
04:54:27.990 --> 04:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
30 seconds left i'm going to
 
04:54:29.350 --> 04:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
rush to make a couple of really
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
important points one is that it's a
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
misstatement that title nine precludes
 
04:54:35.110 --> 04:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
transgender girls from playing in sports
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
programs with boys uh the supreme court
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
has specifically said that sex
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination laws apply to uh protect
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
people based on transgender status and
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
also um a conservative judge in idaho uh
 
04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
appointed by donald trump just last year
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh found one of these bills um
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional a very similar bill so
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
um this bill does not pass muster um the
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
supporters of this bill say it's about
 
04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
fairness but the truth is it's
 
04:55:03.270 --> 04:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
legislative overreach it's in search of
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't exist and it
 
04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
imposes unfairness
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
i urge you please vote itl on this bill
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%

bill 198
 
04:55:55.990 --> 04:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire women's foundation
 
04:55:58.230 --> 04:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
invests in equality and opportunity for
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
women and girls through research
 
04:56:02.550 --> 04:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
advocacy and philanthropy
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
and along with our predecessor
 
04:56:05.750 --> 04:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
organizations the new hampshire
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
commission on the status of women the
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire women's lobby and the new
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire women's policy institute we've
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
been a consistent and leading voice for
 
04:56:15.750 --> 04:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
the advancement and protection of women
 
04:56:17.350 --> 04:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
and girls here in new hampshire for a
 
04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
combined 50 years
 
04:56:21.430 --> 04:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to issues of sex and gender
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination we have a long history as
 
04:56:26.230 --> 04:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
a leading voice for title ix here in the
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
state advocating for equity in school
 
04:56:30.550 --> 04:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
sports opportunity for women and girls
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
to benefit from athletic participation
 
04:56:35.590 --> 04:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
and teamwork and competition
 
04:56:37.830 --> 04:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
the fundamental premise of house bill
 
04:56:37.840 --> 04:56:39.590 align:start position:0%
the fundamental premise of house bill
198

04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
198
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
that cease gender women and girls are
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
better served by the exclusion of women
 
04:56:46.550 --> 04:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
and girls who happen to be transgender
 
04:56:48.550 --> 04:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
is one that we reject at the women's
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
foundation and we encourage this
 
04:56:52.230 --> 04:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
committee to do the same
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
house bill 198 is state-sponsored
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination and promotes exclusion
 
04:57:00.310 --> 04:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
and unequal access to education
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
the impact of such discrimination can be
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
severe and have lifelong harm
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
for transgender children and youth
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
compared to allowing them to participate
 
04:57:11.430 --> 04:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
in recreational support
 
04:57:11.440 --> 04:57:12.550 align:start position:0%
in recreational support
sports

04:57:12.550 --> 04:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
sports
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh in affirming their gender identity
 
04:57:17.190 --> 04:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
which can provide an enormous boost to
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
their self-confidence and their
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
self-esteem that will help them succeed
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
in all areas of life
 
04:57:24.788 --> 04:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
we believe that providing equal
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities in all aspects of school
 
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
programming should be the core value in
 
04:57:30.080 --> 04:57:32.150 align:start position:0%
programming should be the core value in
education

04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
this legislation would authorize schools
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
and districts to violate new hampshire's
 
04:57:39.030 --> 04:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
nondiscrimination laws that have been
 
04:57:42.310 --> 04:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
worked on in many uh over recent years
 
04:57:44.550 --> 04:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
um paulana belkin was able to point out
 
04:57:46.948 --> 04:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
that for you earlier in testimony so i'm
 
04:57:48.670 --> 04:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
not going to review those but those
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws to be inclusive
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
um of our transgender
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
sisters are are very important and our
 
04:57:59.190 --> 04:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
foundation of the women's
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
foundation's advocacy in this area
 
04:58:04.708 --> 04:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh i want to emphasize uh what chris
 
04:58:07.110 --> 04:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
urchel just said um the policies
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
advanced in 198 are actually at odds
 
04:58:12.708 --> 04:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
with title ix
 
04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
and the previous testimony about title
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
ix not being supportive of the
 
04:58:16.638 --> 04:58:18.230 align:start position:0%
ix not being supportive of the
inclusiveness

04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
inclusiveness
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
of transgender women in sports
 
04:58:24.788 --> 04:58:24.798 align:start position:0%
is not a legal conclusion that's sound
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire women's foundation is
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
a state-based organization but when
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're working on issues like this we
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
look to national advocates as well
 
04:58:35.110 --> 04:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
so the national women's law center the
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
national women's sports foundation
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh and the national women's in college
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
sports are all organizations that are um
 
04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
behind our position as well i see my
 
04:58:46.550 --> 04:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
time is up uh we at the women's
 
04:58:48.470 --> 04:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
foundation urge you to reject this
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
proposal uh and thank you for the change
 
04:58:51.360 --> 04:58:52.070 align:start position:0%
proposal uh and thank you for the change
yes

04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:59.360 --> 04:59:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:59:01.030 --> 04:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you jennifer your
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
testimony for taking my question would
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
you believe that i had two daughters who
 
04:59:10.390 --> 04:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
played soccer at concord high school
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
and there was a game with against gosh
 
04:59:15.350 --> 04:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
town where katie and the goffstown girl
 
04:59:18.390 --> 04:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
were both running full speed for about
 
04:59:21.270 --> 04:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
50 50 well there was a collision
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
the other girl suffered a terrible
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
broken leg ambulance came out
 
04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
both those girls weighed
 
04:59:30.550 --> 04:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
115 pounds or whatever or something like
 
04:59:30.560 --> 04:59:31.670 align:start position:0%
115 pounds or whatever or something like
that

04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
would you be concerned about a 180 pound
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
player born a biological male running
 
04:59:39.270 --> 04:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
full bore from the other direction
 
04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
against a
 
04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
girl who say weighs 110 pounds for a
 
04:59:46.230 --> 04:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
50-50 blog do you think that 70-pound
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
disparity would put the smaller girl at
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
a significant physical risk
 
04:59:54.390 --> 04:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
well in the research that i've done
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
around this issue and the experts that
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
i've looked at you know as well as the
 
05:00:00.550 --> 05:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
experience i know about adolescents and
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh children of of all
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
genders grow at different stages and
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
sizes and whether or not they're of
 
05:00:10.230 --> 05:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
different biological sexes that type of
 
05:00:13.270 --> 05:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
disparity exists i certainly think that
 
05:00:15.510 --> 05:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
that public safety and the safety of
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
athletics have gone into the
 
05:00:19.670 --> 05:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
consideration of policies of expert
 
05:00:21.430 --> 05:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
organizations like the new hampshire
 
05:00:24.390 --> 05:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
interscholastic athletic association and
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school boards
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
association and others who have worked
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
on this and so um i believe that
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
the safety of participants is already in

05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
in exeter i'm a retired pediatrician and
 
05:01:16.708 --> 05:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking today as a representative
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire chapter of the
 
05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
american academy of pediatrics
 
05:01:20.718 --> 05:01:21.510 align:start position:0%
american academy of pediatrics
which

05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
has a membership of over 240
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
pediatricians in the state
 
05:01:27.990 --> 05:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
our chapter strongly urges you to vote
 
05:01:31.350 --> 05:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 198 inexpedient to legislate
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
additionally i have been asked by the
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical society and the
 
05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire psychiatric association to
 
05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
let you know that they also strongly
 
05:01:42.070 --> 05:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 198
 
05:01:43.750 --> 05:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would hurt transgendered
 
05:01:46.310 --> 05:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
children would be extremely difficult to
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
implement and is not necessary to allow
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
non-transgender children a fair chance
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
to participate in high school and
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
post-secondary sports
 
05:01:57.750 --> 05:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
i will be submitting these comments
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
under a letter signed by our chapter
 
05:02:02.310 --> 05:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
president eric schestler
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
like all children it's good for
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
transgender children to be physically
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
socially and emotionally
 
05:02:07.920 --> 05:02:08.948 align:start position:0%
socially and emotionally
um

05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
for them to be physically active and to
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
participate in sports with their friends
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
and peers
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
being excluded is especially hard for
 
05:02:17.990 --> 05:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
transgender children because it
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
aggravates their already high risk for
 
05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
depression and suicide
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 198 would hurt these children
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
who just want to play on teams like
 
05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
other kids and who especially need to be
 
05:02:31.270 --> 05:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
accepted by others
 
05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
boys who transition to girls may begin
 
05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
medical treatment at different stages
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
before reaching puberty boys and girls
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
do not differ in height muscle or bone
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
mass there is no evidence that boys
 
05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
who've begun to transition to girls at
 
05:02:46.550 --> 05:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
this stage have any advantage in
 
05:02:46.560 --> 05:02:48.390 align:start position:0%
this stage have any advantage in
athletics

05:02:48.390 --> 05:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
athletics
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
optical optimal medical care for these
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
children is to block puberty so that the
 
05:02:55.750 --> 05:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
expected rise in testosterone increased
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
muscle strength and bone density do not
 
05:02:58.080 --> 05:02:59.110 align:start position:0%
muscle strength and bone density do not
occur

05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
occur
 
05:03:01.030 --> 05:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
no child in these categories is any
 
05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
threat to girls playing sports
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
the mcaa specifically opposes
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination against these young
 
05:03:09.670 --> 05:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
people it also opposes what is sometimes
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
called sex verification this is the
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
humiliating and at times medically
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
impossible task of determining what sex
 
05:03:18.390 --> 05:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
a person is
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
implementing house bill 198 would be
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
similarly humiliating and medically
 
05:03:22.400 --> 05:03:23.590 align:start position:0%
similarly humiliating and medically
impossible

05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
not all humans are either male or female
 
05:03:27.990 --> 05:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
there are people who fall somewhere in
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
between these two categories into what
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
is called intersex
 
05:03:34.948 --> 05:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
sex verification will not work for them
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
the ncaa said fears that men pretend to
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
be female to compete on women's teams
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
are unwarranted given that in the entire
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
40-year history of sex verification
 
05:03:47.110 --> 05:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
procedures in international sports
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
competition no such instances of fraud
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
have been revealed
 
05:03:52.708 --> 05:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
additionally the american academy of
 
05:03:56.150 --> 05:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
pediatrics has a strong stance against
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination on this issue therefore
 
05:04:00.310 --> 05:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
we encourage the committee to vote the
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill itl
 
05:04:02.160 --> 05:04:02.830 align:start position:0%
bill itl
thank

05:04:02.830 --> 05:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:04:05.670 --> 05:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
you enough
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing so uh thank you very much
 
05:04:21.990 --> 05:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
welcome to education
 
05:04:26.550 --> 05:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
hello um so hi my name is laura lee
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
godfrey i go by she her pronouns and i'm
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
16 years old and i'm also the secretary
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's legislative youth
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
advisory council and i'm here today to
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
speak on their behalf and i also did
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony as well so the
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legislative youth advisory
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
council strongly opposes hb 198 which
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
restricts individuals assigned male
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
birth from participating in women's
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
sports and various testimonies have gone
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
over this but today i'm also here to
 
05:04:52.708 --> 05:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
talk about the impacts of this bill if
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
it were passed uh we argue that this
 
05:04:55.990 --> 05:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill is going to create more problems
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
than it would solve in that it would
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
solve none has it all 14 of citations
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
which i've also linked to in my written
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
testimony reveals that members of the
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
transgender community experience
 
05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
severely high suicide rates influenced
 
05:05:08.708 --> 05:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
by mental health factors like
 
05:05:10.390 --> 05:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination the type of which this
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill would promote and as well as
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
rejection or gender dysphoria and sports
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
have long been associated with improving
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
mental health as evidenced by rosemont
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
at all 14 and hardy at all 15 and they
 
05:05:22.628 --> 05:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
find that when access to sports is
 
05:05:24.550 --> 05:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
diminished trans individuals feel
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
alienated from their peers and their
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
physical and social well-being are
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
harmed and this bill would prevent
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
gender affirming sports at risk of
 
05:05:32.868 --> 05:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
isolating trans individuals and
 
05:05:34.868 --> 05:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
negatively impacting their mental health
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
so there's no singular case in new
 
05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire in which a pla a fair a fair
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
competitive playing field would not be
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by sports under current
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
regulation and as previous testimonies
 
05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
have mentioned right now the new
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire interscholastic athletic
 
05:05:49.830 --> 05:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
association or the nhiaa already has a
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
policy that evaluates trans women's
 
05:05:53.190 --> 05:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
participation in sports on a
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis in their policy
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
statement and school recommendation
 
05:05:58.628 --> 05:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
regarding transgender participation and
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
this process resolves issues on an
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
individual stance that takes into
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
account gender effort information and
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
competitiveness so this bill is not
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
intended to promote fairness in women's
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
sports because this ignores the current
 
05:06:10.550 --> 05:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
policies that already address it and
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
consequently it is solely discriminatory
 
05:06:14.390 --> 05:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
and harmful it might be said to be done
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
in order to protect or promote women's
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
sports but excluding women from women's
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
sports is not achieving that goal in any
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
way and allowing trans women
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
into sports is not a reversal of women's
 
05:06:26.868 --> 05:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
rights in any way either as
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative vlad said because in fact
 
05:06:29.750 --> 05:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's the actually the ultimate
 
05:06:32.070 --> 05:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
representation of its promotion and
 
05:06:34.390 --> 05:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
protection and it is far encompassing in
 
05:06:35.830 --> 05:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
its attempt to address any issue and
 
05:06:37.270 --> 05:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
crafting a bill to entirely prevent
 
05:06:39.270 --> 05:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
transgender women has the potential to
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
exacerbate mental health issues and
 
05:06:42.550 --> 05:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
suicide rates in our states and for
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
these reasons the new hampshire
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory council is in
 
05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
strong opposition and urges a vote
 
05:06:50.230 --> 05:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
against hb 198. thank you for your time
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
and i will answer any questions if you
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
have them
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
i just want to say thank you that's the
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
most information i've ever heard in two
 
05:07:03.510 --> 05:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
minutes in all my years on this
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you young lady for
 
05:07:13.670 --> 05:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um approximately how
 
05:07:15.910 --> 05:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
many people make up make up the council
 
05:07:18.550 --> 05:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
and where are they uh from
 
05:07:20.788 --> 05:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh so i think approximately 20 people
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
make up
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire legislative advisory
 
05:07:26.788 --> 05:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
council and uh the application process
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
is based on picking people from a wide
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
geographic diversity to ensure each
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
county in the state is represented
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
well done by the way
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i was just wondering if uh if you
 
05:07:43.830 --> 05:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
have a testimony prepared could you send
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
that into our
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
education committee uh yes i did email
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
it to you guys this morning
 
05:07:57.910 --> 05:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:01.110 --> 05:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and laura lee nicely
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
done very
 
05:08:04.948 --> 05:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
very articulate
 
05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
and uh easily understandable i have a
 
05:08:10.628 --> 05:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
question for you regarding the process
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
by which uh liak
 
05:08:15.990 --> 05:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
comes to a decision or or whatever about
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
what to support
 
05:08:17.600 --> 05:08:18.470 align:start position:0%
what to support
so

05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
today you came
 
05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
on behalf of lyak so am i correct in
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
assuming that there is discussion among
 
05:08:28.830 --> 05:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
the members of
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
lyak regarding what you're going to
 
05:08:31.680 --> 05:08:32.788 align:start position:0%
lyak regarding what you're going to
support

05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:08:36.150 --> 05:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the second part of my question is
 
05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
in your discussion did you become aware
 
05:08:40.948 --> 05:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
of any
 
05:08:42.550 --> 05:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
schools or
 
05:08:44.550 --> 05:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
geographic regions
 
05:08:44.560 --> 05:08:45.510 align:start position:0%
geographic regions
where

05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
this um was being presented as an issue
 
05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much for your question
 
05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
mullin so yes to answer your first
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
question there was a vast amount of
 
05:08:57.030 --> 05:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on the spill uh there was an
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
interest group that specifically studied
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
it and then we brought it to the rest of
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
the council to go over and thus we
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
decided to vote against it and then as
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
to your second question in our research
 
05:09:08.550 --> 05:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
we did not find any school district or
 
05:09:11.110 --> 05:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
institution or club sport that had
 
05:09:14.708 --> 05:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
listed this as an issue so yes thank you
 
05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:18.550 --> 05:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:09:20.550 --> 05:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
for the question so uh thank you very
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
much for
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for having me
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
um i
 
05:09:35.200 --> 05:09:36.390 align:start position:0%
um i
uh

05:09:36.390 --> 05:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:09:37.750 --> 05:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
my name is colin goodbread i'm a
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
resident of hanover i'm here to urge you
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
to vote no on hb 198 and i have emailed
 
05:09:47.270 --> 05:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
my testimony to the committee already
 
05:09:47.280 --> 05:09:48.150 align:start position:0%
my testimony to the committee already
um

05:09:48.150 --> 05:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm a transgender man meaning that i
 
05:09:52.070 --> 05:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
was assigned female at birth and have
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
transitioned to living my life as a man
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm appalled that the legislators
 
05:09:57.510 --> 05:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
who are supposed to represent me are
 
05:09:59.350 --> 05:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
advancing a bill that is unfounded in
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
medical research would harm vulnerable
 
05:10:03.670 --> 05:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
students and waste time addressing a
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
problem that does not exist i am proud
 
05:10:07.750 --> 05:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
to participate on my school's triathlon
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
team where i'm fully welcomed on the
 
05:10:11.670 --> 05:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
team for exactly who i am while my
 
05:10:13.350 --> 05:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
teammates and i train hard i'm like the
 
05:10:15.670 --> 05:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
vast majority of transgender athletes
 
05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm extremely mediocre and certainly not
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
a threat to anyone's professional
 
05:10:21.910 --> 05:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
athletic careers trans women and girls
 
05:10:23.350 --> 05:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
are not taking away anyone's
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities for success
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
indeed a 2015 study by dr joanna harper
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
found the transgender women performed
 
05:10:32.310 --> 05:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
similarly to how they had before
 
05:10:34.150 --> 05:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
transition in comparison to
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
non-transgender athletes that is the
 
05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
vast majority of transgender athletes
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
are like me incredibly average
 
05:10:42.868 --> 05:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
yet this proposed legislation would
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
require children who live their lives as
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
girls and are seen as girls by all of
 
05:10:49.270 --> 05:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
their friends and family to compete only
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
against men
 
05:10:52.948 --> 05:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
hb 198 would be harmful to transgender
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
students of all ages and their
 
05:10:56.310 --> 05:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
confidence and mental health
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill
 
05:10:59.830 --> 05:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
claim to care about protecting young
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
women in sports but i'd like you to
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
consider what other priorities uh
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
support that claim
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
if our representatives truly care about
 
05:11:09.510 --> 05:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
protecting girls we would see them
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
passing legislation to fund women's
 
05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
health centers advocating for sexual
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
assault prevention and working to
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
improve the underrepresented
 
05:11:19.350 --> 05:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
underrepresentation of female athletes
 
05:11:21.270 --> 05:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the media not trying to prevent
 
05:11:23.830 --> 05:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
children from playing sports so let's
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
start making real progress towards
 
05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
gender equality and not making up
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
problems that don't exist in the name of
 
05:11:32.070 --> 05:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
hate please vote no on hb 198 thank you
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
for your time and i'm open to any
 
05:11:33.360 --> 05:11:35.190 align:start position:0%
for your time and i'm open to any
questions

05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much tom
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:43.270 --> 05:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you very much
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for having me
 
05:11:53.120 --> 05:11:54.070 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for having me
so

05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:11:56.470 --> 05:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
my name is olivia goodwin and i will be
 
05:11:58.230 --> 05:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
emailing my full testimony after this
 
05:12:00.070 --> 05:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
meeting i stand in front of opposition
 
05:12:02.550 --> 05:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
to this legislation i pole vault and
 
05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
long jump on dartmouth's track and field
 
05:12:05.590 --> 05:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
team i am a division one athlete who
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
does not identify as man or woman though
 
05:12:10.150 --> 05:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
i am confined to compete on one of the
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
two gendered teams at my school since
 
05:12:13.590 --> 05:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
our track program does not have a mixed
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
team when we compete i understand the
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
primary fear that male-to-female
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
athletes may have a physical advantage
 
05:12:20.788 --> 05:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
on women's teams
 
05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
the ncaa handbook already has regulation
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
protecting against competitive advantage
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
the most recent handbook is published
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
online from 2011 on page 13 it states
 
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
that a trans female athlete may compete
 
05:12:34.150 --> 05:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
on a women's team without changing the
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
team's status to mix after she has
 
05:12:38.470 --> 05:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
completed a full calendar year of
 
05:12:40.550 --> 05:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
testosterone suppression treatment the
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
treatment may be in the form of hormone
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
replacement or surgery which prevents
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
the body from creating male typical
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
levels of testosterone in either form
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
the one year time delay stands this is
 
05:12:51.670 --> 05:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
according to the 2018 inclusion forum
 
05:12:53.830 --> 05:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
focusing on transgender athletes placed
 
05:12:56.310 --> 05:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
within collegiate athletics finally i
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
would like to note this bill's
 
05:12:59.910 --> 05:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation of biological sex as it
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
defines femaleness and maleness the bill
 
05:13:03.910 --> 05:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
states that quote these differences
 
05:13:06.230 --> 05:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
limiting athletic teams on to sex
 
05:13:08.550 --> 05:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
specific biological teams ensure that
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
biological females have equal athletic
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
opportunities the problem with this
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation of biological sex is its
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
erasure of the natural spectrum of
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
testosterone level in quote biological
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
females which already allows for some
 
05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
competitors to have physical advantage
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
despite fitting into the socially agreed
 
05:13:26.948 --> 05:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
upon definition of female a more
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
productive change to athletics would be
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
05:13:32.788 --> 05:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
gender categorization apart from
 
05:13:35.510 --> 05:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
self-defined teams instead of gender
 
05:13:37.430 --> 05:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
deciding who competes against who
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
competitors could be competing in tears
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
which they qualify for by their personal
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
best on record or perhaps placement
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be determined by physical height
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
or weight as many sports favor taller
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
players and some sports already utilize
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
those regulations think wrestling for
 
05:13:51.520 --> 05:13:53.190 align:start position:0%
those regulations think wrestling for
example

05:13:53.190 --> 05:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:13:55.030 --> 05:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
the award system would also be modified
 
05:13:56.550 --> 05:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
to reflect the tiers
 
05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
taking all this into account i urge
 
05:14:01.830 --> 05:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
everyone to vote itl on house bill 198
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
grant trans athletes the right to
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
compete on their proper team and grant
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%

they are not looking to steal medals or
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
cheat systems
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
cheaters are always going to cheat
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
they just want to play
 
05:16:01.830 --> 05:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
please let my child continue to
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
participate in in her sports and

i want to note that
 
05:16:15.990 --> 05:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of what they may be
 
05:16:16.000 --> 05:16:16.868 align:start position:0%
the idea of what they may be
um

05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:20.070 --> 05:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
put to the test to describe or
 
05:16:24.550 --> 05:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
um confirm their gender is also a very
 
05:16:27.190 --> 05:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
upsetting concept as the doctor
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
sex verification so is this really fair
 
05:16:34.550 --> 05:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
to any of the women being questioned on
 
05:16:37.910 --> 05:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and i strongly oppose the
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
passing of this thank you
 
05:16:41.120 --> 05:16:44.470 align:start position:0%
passing of this thank you
definitely

05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%

thank you good afternoon thank you mr
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee my
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
name is jeannie herreska and i'm the
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
political director for the american
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
civil liberties union of new hampshire
 
05:17:10.470 --> 05:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
today in strong opposition to hb 198 and
 
05:17:15.430 --> 05:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time i'm going to
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
restrict my testimony to some of the
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
potential legal consequences of passing
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
as you all know the new hampshire
 
05:17:25.350 --> 05:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislature defeated similar legislation
 
05:17:27.750 --> 05:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
last year in both the house and senate
 
05:17:30.868 --> 05:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
since then the u.s supreme court ruled
 
05:17:32.788 --> 05:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
in bostock v clayton city that
 
05:17:35.030 --> 05:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination against someone because
 
05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
of their gender identity is sex
 
05:17:37.760 --> 05:17:39.190 align:start position:0%
of their gender identity is sex
discrimination

05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
05:17:40.788 --> 05:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
moreover i want to point out that
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
recently the federal government has made
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
clear that it intends to enforce title
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
ix consistent with the supreme court's
 
05:17:50.788 --> 05:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
holding in postdoc such that any state
 
05:17:53.190 --> 05:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
that passes a law barring trans students
 
05:17:55.750 --> 05:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
from activities and spaces that align
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
with their gender identity will risk
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
their title ix compliance and the
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars they receive in
 
05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
federal education funding i also want to
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
know at the state level idaho passed
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
very similar legislation last year and
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
the state immediately found itself in
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
court where a judge imposed a
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
preliminary injunction barring the law
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
from taking effect
 
05:18:20.470 --> 05:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
in his decision in that case judge nye
 
05:18:22.230 --> 05:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
determined that those challenging the
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
idaho law were quote likely to succeed
 
05:18:26.910 --> 05:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
in establishing the act as
 
05:18:29.350 --> 05:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as currently written
 
05:18:31.510 --> 05:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
due to the inescapable conclusion that
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
the act discriminates on the basis of
 
05:18:36.628 --> 05:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
transgender status the judge noted that
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
the state had not identified a
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
legitimate interest served by the act
 
05:18:43.110 --> 05:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
other than an invalid interest of
 
05:18:45.990 --> 05:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
excluding transgender women and girls
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
from women's sports entirely
 
05:18:52.868 --> 05:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
in sum this extreme policy violates the
 
05:18:55.030 --> 05:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution and federal civil
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
rights law puts new hampshire at risk of
 
05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
losing hundreds of millions of dollars
 
05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
in federal funding and costing the state
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
more money in litigation costs
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
and harms transgender youth and in terms
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
of litigation costs i will note that the
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
idaho litigation has already cost
 
05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars and
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
that price tag is rising if the case
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately goes to trial we expect it to
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
cost at least five million dollars in
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
costs and fees
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
and in
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic i would dare sit dare
 
05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
to suggest that granite staters can
 
05:19:33.990 --> 05:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
think of much better ways to spend their
 
05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
tax dollars than on litigation to defend
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
a bill that violates state and federal
 
05:19:38.878 --> 05:19:39.750 align:start position:0%
a bill that violates state and federal
law

05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
i will send in my written testimony i'm
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions and i strongly
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to vote itl on
 
05:19:49.110 --> 05:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
hb 198.
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:19:55.270 --> 05:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:55.280 --> 05:19:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
mr questions

05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much and thank you
 
05:20:00.550 --> 05:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
very much mr oscar for joining us this
 
05:20:03.670 --> 05:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon on that so um you know looking
 
05:20:07.110 --> 05:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
looking beyond the just the the blatant
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
um unfairness and discrimination that
 
05:20:12.070 --> 05:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's at work here
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could break down
 
05:20:16.390 --> 05:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
the the financial
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
impact in terms of loss of loss of
 
05:20:22.948 --> 05:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
primary secondary and um and
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
post-secondary educational systems
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have those numbers though i
 
05:20:31.830 --> 05:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage this committee to
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
take a close look at those numbers um
 
05:20:36.070 --> 05:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'll just reiterate that again since the
 
05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
supreme court's decision in bostock
 
05:20:40.470 --> 05:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
courts have repeatedly held that title
 
05:20:42.788 --> 05:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
ix prohibition on sex discrimination
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
prohibits discrimination against
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
transgender students
 
05:20:50.470 --> 05:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
so this bill will violate title ix
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
and so any funding that the state gets
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
requires compliance with title ix would
 
05:20:58.390 --> 05:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
be threatened
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh were this bill to pass
 
05:21:05.590 --> 05:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
so fault follow up on that mr chair
 
05:21:09.430 --> 05:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
so um so not only would that affect um
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
title four
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
um um student federal student loans but
 
05:21:17.110 --> 05:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
could that also affect um um the
 
05:21:18.390 --> 05:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars in
 
05:21:21.510 --> 05:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
research grants i believe so yeah this
 
05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
bill applies to
 
05:21:26.948 --> 05:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education um so i think
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
the state should take a very careful
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
look at all the education funding it
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
gets from the federal government before
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
it contemplates passing this bill
 
05:21:41.030 --> 05:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:41.040 --> 05:21:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:21:43.040 --> 05:21:53.830 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:21:53.830 --> 05:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh hello my name is elaine jocelyn i was

05:22:12.868 --> 05:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
any physical threat to anyone else on

the soccer field
 
05:22:16.788 --> 05:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
i absolutely love the sport of soccer
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
i've played for the last 10 years and
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
i've played on the girls soccer team for
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
the last five years
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
playing soccer has always been the
 
05:22:26.310 --> 05:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
highlight of my day each summer and fall
 
05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's my opportunity to work out to
 
05:22:29.830 --> 05:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
collaborate with other girls with the
 
05:22:32.150 --> 05:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
same passion and just have fun
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
i usually play santa striker
 
05:22:36.310 --> 05:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
last year the extra girls university
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
team had just suffered a huge loss
 
05:22:40.948 --> 05:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
against our rival andover we all we were
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
all crying on the way home and hugging
 
05:22:44.550 --> 05:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
each other in consolation
 
05:22:46.390 --> 05:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
then one of my team captains started
 
05:22:46.400 --> 05:22:47.190 align:start position:0%
then one of my team captains started
playing

05:22:47.190 --> 05:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
playing
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
a party in the usa on a speaker a pop
 
05:22:52.390 --> 05:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
song by miley cyrus needless to say
 
05:22:54.788 --> 05:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
everybody knew the song soon we were all
 
05:22:56.708 --> 05:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
laughing up from our seats waving our
 
05:23:00.070 --> 05:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
hands around screaming the lyrics
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
we were all laughing and singing the
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
notes totally off key but it was a
 
05:23:05.670 --> 05:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
complete blast our mood shift and our
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
mood shifted from miserable to joyful i
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
loved every minute minute of it
 
05:23:11.990 --> 05:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
sharing this thing of the loss trying to
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
figure out what we could have done
 
05:23:15.270 --> 05:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
better and a short time later getting
 
05:23:17.110 --> 05:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
over the pain and simply loving being
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
teammates is it is one of my most
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
cherished memories
 
05:23:22.948 --> 05:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
please don't deny other transgender
 
05:23:24.628 --> 05:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
girls the opportunity to have these
 
05:23:26.948 --> 05:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
experiences and the ability to be on a
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
team just having fun and learning about
 
05:23:28.638 --> 05:23:29.910 align:start position:0%
team just having fun and learning about
sportsmanship

05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
sportsmanship
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
everyone should be able to participate
 
05:23:33.510 --> 05:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether regardless of their gender
 
05:23:33.520 --> 05:23:34.550 align:start position:0%
whether regardless of their gender
identity

05:23:34.550 --> 05:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
identity
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
and fyi not one person on my soccer team
 
05:23:40.150 --> 05:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
last year knew i was transgender but if
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
they had known i can guarantee you they
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have cared hopefully that shows
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
just how little it matters thank you for
 
05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
your time
 
05:23:49.430 --> 05:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:23:49.440 --> 05:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
questions

05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:00.070 --> 05:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:00.080 --> 05:24:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay next we have elizabeth
 
05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:21.510 --> 05:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay great my name is elizabeth leahy
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
and i am here to testify in opposition
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
of hb um
 
05:24:25.520 --> 05:24:27.110 align:start position:0%
of hb um
198.

05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
198.
 
05:24:29.590 --> 05:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the state recognized that all
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
people regardless of a number of bases
 
05:24:33.670 --> 05:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
including gender and gender identity
 
05:24:35.590 --> 05:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
have the right to fully participate in
 
05:24:37.830 --> 05:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
enjoy the benefits of and be free from
 
05:24:39.910 --> 05:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination in public schools new
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire codified these rights in new
 
05:24:43.190 --> 05:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire law
 
05:24:44.948 --> 05:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
the bill today seeks to roll back the
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
recognition of these rights and create
 
05:24:47.948 --> 05:24:47.958 align:start position:0%
an exception to these
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination protections the
 
05:24:52.550 --> 05:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
government is wrong anytime it seeks to
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
walk back rights and legalize
 
05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination against a targeted group
 
05:24:57.910 --> 05:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
of people
 
05:25:00.150 --> 05:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
i am a lifelong athlete and including
 
05:25:02.230 --> 05:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
was one at the division one level
 
05:25:04.230 --> 05:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'm acutely aware of the value of school
 
05:25:05.910 --> 05:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
athletic programs that they provide to
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
all students but particularly girls
 
05:25:10.390 --> 05:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
leadership confidence teamwork and
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
discipline all girls are entitled to
 
05:25:14.470 --> 05:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
this opportunity and especially so
 
05:25:16.948 --> 05:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
within our public schools
 
05:25:18.708 --> 05:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
though the stated goal of the bill is to
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
preserve girls athletics if implemented
 
05:25:23.270 --> 05:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
it would actually hinder and set a
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
ceiling on girls athletics
 
05:25:27.270 --> 05:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
inherent in the bill is a proposition
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
that girls are superior to boys and that
 
05:25:31.830 --> 05:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
if a girl is too good she must not
 
05:25:33.430 --> 05:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
really be a girl
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
we see this nationally and
 
05:25:36.550 --> 05:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
internationally with athletes like
 
05:25:39.110 --> 05:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
castor semena and even serena williams
 
05:25:40.868 --> 05:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
bills like this create a framework to
 
05:25:43.430 --> 05:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
gatekeep women womanhood and all women
 
05:25:46.868 --> 05:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
suffer under these types of restrictions
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
lastly this effort is rooted in fear and
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
entitlement and not in science or
 
05:25:50.878 --> 05:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
entitlement and not in science or
reality

05:25:51.990 --> 05:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
reality
 
05:25:53.510 --> 05:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
nowhere in this country are trans
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
athletes dominating any level of
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
athletics instead trans people are like
 
05:26:00.230 --> 05:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
cis people some are very good athletes
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
and some are bad athletes very few are
 
05:26:04.550 --> 05:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
exceptional athletes capable of
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
as we
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
as a society continue to broaden our
 
05:26:12.868 --> 05:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
understanding of what it means to be a
 
05:26:16.230 --> 05:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
woman we must actively reject feelings
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
that something to which we feel entitled
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
is being taken away
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
trans women have the right to
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
participate and succeed in something
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
athletics or otherwise without being
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
accused of taking from cis women
 
05:26:30.310 --> 05:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
rather than teaching kids that they've
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
been harmed when somebody has finally
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
afforded an opportunity after long being
 
05:26:35.830 --> 05:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
denied it we should teach them the
 
05:26:37.350 --> 05:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
importance of recognizing others
 
05:26:39.670 --> 05:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
humanity i thank you for the opportunity
 
05:26:41.910 --> 05:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
to speak and i ask you to itl the bill
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:47.910 --> 05:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.230 --> 05:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
no questions so
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:54.070 --> 05:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:27:05.670 --> 05:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:05.680 --> 05:27:06.708 align:start position:0%
 
hi

05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
hi
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your time and attention
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
um i think everything that i would like
 
05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
to say has pretty much been covered my
 
05:27:15.590 --> 05:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
transgender daughter has never been
 
05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
through male puberty and she has less
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
testosterone in her body than a typical
 
05:27:20.788 --> 05:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
girl according to her pediatric
 
05:27:20.798 --> 05:27:22.230 align:start position:0%
girl according to her pediatric
endocrinologist

05:27:22.230 --> 05:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist
 
05:27:24.390 --> 05:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
so she has no physical advantage over
 
05:27:24.400 --> 05:27:25.590 align:start position:0%
so she has no physical advantage over
anyone

05:27:25.590 --> 05:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
um as a high school athlete myself i
 
05:27:31.750 --> 05:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
understand how important the work ethic
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
the goals the skills
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
being outside um you know just being
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
part of a sports team how critical that
 
05:27:40.150 --> 05:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
is to development for teenagers and kids
 
05:27:40.160 --> 05:27:41.270 align:start position:0%
is to development for teenagers and kids
and

05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:42.868 --> 05:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why all three of my
 
05:27:44.070 --> 05:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
children shouldn't be able to
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
participate in that that one should be
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
singled out so
 
05:27:49.030 --> 05:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
i i'm gonna wrap it up there because i
 
05:27:51.190 --> 05:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
think um you know my point of view has
 
05:27:52.948 --> 05:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
been covered very well by so many
 
05:27:54.310 --> 05:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
different people but i would just want
 
05:27:57.750 --> 05:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
to add that when i hear legislators in
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
discuss transgender people and say that
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're pretending to be
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
girls or claiming to be girls it makes
 
05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
me realize there's a lot of education
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done and i would urge
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
the legislators who don't understand
 
05:28:15.030 --> 05:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
what it means to be transgender to dig a
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
little deeper and try to get educated
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
because it's very insulting to hear that
 
05:28:22.628 --> 05:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
kind of language thank you
 
05:28:27.030 --> 05:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
i guess um
 
05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
you signed in in support of this bill
 
05:28:32.990 --> 05:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:28:33.000 --> 05:28:36.390 align:start position:0%
all right

uh mr claude thank you for taking my
 
05:28:54.310 --> 05:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
question uh does your transgender
 
05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
daughter participate in in sport now
 
05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
whatever at whatever level she's at
 
05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes she does it's been a huge
 
05:29:03.120 --> 05:29:05.270 align:start position:0%
yes she does it's been a huge
um

05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:07.750 --> 05:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
you you actually met her that's lane is
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
my daughter oh okay okay
 
05:29:14.230 --> 05:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah i'm very proud of her and um and
 
05:29:17.590 --> 05:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
um i just i can't emphasize enough how
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
important sports has been to her feeling
 
05:29:22.230 --> 05:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
part of her community and um
 
05:29:23.990 --> 05:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know i think that that that her
 
05:29:25.590 --> 05:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
social transition that happened in fifth
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
grade really changed her life to be able
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:29:31.590 --> 05:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
her authentic self and be the happy kind
 
05:29:34.470 --> 05:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
loving smart kid that she is very um
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
engaged and um you know she hadn't
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
socially transitioned at that time
 
05:29:41.830 --> 05:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
um you know like people have said the
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
the outcomes are not what they are when
 
05:29:45.750 --> 05:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
they get full acceptance not just from
 
05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
family but from school communities and
 
05:29:49.590 --> 05:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
the greater community and this as a
 
05:29:51.030 --> 05:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
business owner in portsmouth this would
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
be a big black eye for our state if one
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up is the chair for me
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
i'll be quick thank you mr mccall one
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
more question uh in the parent community
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
which i'm sure you're involved in around
 
05:30:03.990 --> 05:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
your youngsters
 
05:30:06.390 --> 05:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh is there a dialogue is there talk one
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely i mean i think that the
 
05:30:12.230 --> 05:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
genie's point that this will cost the
 
05:30:13.910 --> 05:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
state a lot of money is very accurate
 
05:30:17.110 --> 05:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
there is a large mama bear community
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
of of
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
parents and fathers as well who really
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
um understand that we need to have our
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
kids backs and we will go to the mat for
 
05:30:28.708 --> 05:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
them the i mean if this if this if
 
05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
governor sununu i don't believe he would
 
05:30:32.788 --> 05:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
ever sign this but if this became law
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
there would be lawsuit after lawsuit
 
05:30:38.230 --> 05:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much i appreciate your time
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%

any questions the committee may have
 
05:31:23.750 --> 05:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
so in case people are not aware the

human rights commission was established
 
05:31:26.948 --> 05:31:26.958 align:start position:0%

05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
the commission is comprised of seven
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer commissioners who provide
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
oversight and make decisions on charges
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
of discrimination
 
05:32:02.708 --> 05:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
each commissioner is appointed by the
 
05:32:04.150 --> 05:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
governor with the consent of the
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
executive council for a term of five
 
05:32:06.638 --> 05:32:08.150 align:start position:0%
executive council for a term of five
years

05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:32:10.948 --> 05:32:10.958 align:start position:0%
the commission has the power to receive
 
05:32:10.958 --> 05:32:12.310 align:start position:0%
the commission has the power to receive
investigate

05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
05:32:14.230 --> 05:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
pass upon complaints of illegal
 
05:32:16.868 --> 05:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
discrimination and to engage in research
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
education and community outreach
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent discrimination
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
in addition to the authority vested in
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
the commission by rsa 354-a we enforce
 
05:32:28.948 --> 05:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's laws against
 
05:32:28.958 --> 05:32:31.590 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's laws against
discrimination

05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
05:32:34.470 --> 05:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
and we also partner with the eeoc which
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
is also known as the equal employment
 
05:32:38.230 --> 05:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity commission to enforce
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
federal laws prohibiting discrimination
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
and employment as well
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
um very quickly
 
05:32:44.480 --> 05:32:45.190 align:start position:0%
um very quickly
so

05:32:45.190 --> 05:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:45.200 --> 05:32:46.470 align:start position:0%
so
what

05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:32:50.390 --> 05:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
if hb 198 is to pass um certainly the
 
05:32:52.390 --> 05:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
commission will follow
 
05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
the lead of the legislature and we will
 
05:32:56.948 --> 05:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
enforce whatever laws you put on the
 
05:32:56.958 --> 05:32:57.910 align:start position:0%
enforce whatever laws you put on the
books

05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
books
 
05:33:01.110 --> 05:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately the hrc would request clarity
 
05:33:03.750 --> 05:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
in our statutory language as to who can
 
05:33:06.548 --> 05:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
bring a claim who and what grounds
 
05:33:08.548 --> 05:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
to avoid any conflict
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
so this would actually create potential
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
conflict within the statute as to
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
protection and and no protection um and
 
05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
there is no way to know what the federal
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
laws would potentially be
 
05:33:23.590 --> 05:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
moving that are moving through congress
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
and we would like to make sure that we
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
are congruent with federal law and that
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
out of step with what the federal law is
 
05:33:33.190 --> 05:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
and that we're not creating any
 
05:33:35.190 --> 05:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
confusion here within new hampshire
 
05:33:36.868 --> 05:33:36.878 align:start position:0%

hi there
 
05:34:54.310 --> 05:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
sorry about that my computer just
 
05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
blinked out on me
 
05:34:58.230 --> 05:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
chair ladd members of the committee
 
05:35:02.070 --> 05:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
05:35:05.190 --> 05:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
testimony today on behalf of myself and
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
my husband chad turmell
 
05:35:10.708 --> 05:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
we did submit a letter over email stated
 
05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
march 6. so i'm sure you've got that in
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
your record
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
the letter details three things which
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'll just touch on briefly because i
 
05:35:20.390 --> 05:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
know you have that it talks about the
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
rich sports history of our family
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
the process that our transgender
 
05:35:28.070 --> 05:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
daughter has gone through to come out
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
and the risks to her well-being if this
 
05:35:32.548 --> 05:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass
 
05:35:34.470 --> 05:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
beyond that i wanted to get into a few
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
details first two points that are not in
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
my letter to correct the record
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
being transgender
 
05:35:42.788 --> 05:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate
 
05:35:45.030 --> 05:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
medical condition
 
05:35:48.788 --> 05:35:48.798 align:start position:0%
diagnosed by a licensed provider
 
05:35:52.470 --> 05:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's called gender dysphoria
 
05:35:52.480 --> 05:35:53.670 align:start position:0%
it's called gender dysphoria
secondly

05:35:53.670 --> 05:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
the alleged distinctions that
 
05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative ladd made
 
05:35:59.590 --> 05:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
as between um
 
05:36:01.590 --> 05:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
different gendered people
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
are false
 
05:36:05.750 --> 05:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
all trans children
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
like my daughter who transition before
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
puberty especially
 
05:36:13.350 --> 05:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
i have no difference in any of those
 
05:36:15.190 --> 05:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
measures with respect to athletic
 
05:36:15.200 --> 05:36:17.030 align:start position:0%
measures with respect to athletic
performance

05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
performance
 
05:36:18.470 --> 05:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to cover a couple
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
points um highlighting from my letter
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
our transgender daughter
 
05:36:27.270 --> 05:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
will never
 
05:36:32.310 --> 05:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
have the right to play sports in school
 
05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
not at middle school where she is right
 
05:36:34.558 --> 05:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
not at middle school where she is right
now

05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:36:37.270 --> 05:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
not at high school
 
05:36:39.430 --> 05:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
and not at college
 
05:36:41.350 --> 05:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
she will not have the right to play on a
 
05:36:42.628 --> 05:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
girls team
 
05:36:45.110 --> 05:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
and she would never play on the boys
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
team because she's not a boy she's a
 
05:36:48.000 --> 05:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
team because she's not a boy she's a
girl

05:36:49.750 --> 05:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
girl
 
05:36:52.150 --> 05:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
this would be fundamentally unfair to
 
05:36:52.160 --> 05:36:53.430 align:start position:0%
this would be fundamentally unfair to
her

05:36:53.430 --> 05:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
her
 
05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
our daughter has the right to be
 
05:36:55.680 --> 05:36:56.948 align:start position:0%
our daughter has the right to be
included

05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
included
 
05:36:59.430 --> 05:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
in girls sports
 
05:37:01.350 --> 05:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
now as i said the letter describes her
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
coming out but i wanted to highlight
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
something because it really reinforces
 
05:37:07.110 --> 05:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
how real this is
 
05:37:10.390 --> 05:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
her journey began at age three
 
05:37:13.830 --> 05:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
when you know out of nowhere what she
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
wanted for christmas
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
and of course being a girl and now that
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
she's grown up a little bit
 
05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
she wants to play girls sports and when
 
05:37:32.470 --> 05:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a global pandemic hopefully
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
she'll have the right to do that and i
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on the connection with
 
05:37:37.670 --> 05:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
covid because it hasn't been mentioned
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:43.750 --> 05:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
as we are
 
05:37:43.760 --> 05:37:45.830 align:start position:0%
as we are
hopefully

05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
heading towards a lessening of
 
05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions of the pandemic this coming
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
academic year
 
05:37:55.430 --> 05:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
it will be the most important time
 
05:37:57.430 --> 05:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
in my daughter's life i will see that
 
05:37:59.110 --> 05:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
this is time let me just wrap up this
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
point as quickly as i can
 
05:38:04.548 --> 05:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
she likes so many of our children
 
05:38:07.350 --> 05:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
has been isolated from the social and
 
05:38:09.910 --> 05:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
emotional growth that comes with
 
05:38:12.390 --> 05:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
full-time in-person school and
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
extracurriculars it's nobody's fault
 
05:38:16.868 --> 05:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
that's been you know taken away from her
 
05:38:18.788 --> 05:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
and so many other kids but it makes next
 
05:38:21.430 --> 05:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
year so important as she enters sixth
 
05:38:23.910 --> 05:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
grade at three rivers school she becomes
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for lots and lots of sports
 
05:38:26.400 --> 05:38:27.510 align:start position:0%

teams
 
05:38:29.910 --> 05:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
unless of course a bill like this has
 
05:38:32.230 --> 05:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
passed and becomes law
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%

my transgender niece
 
05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
i happen to live with a chronic disease
 
05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
called predatory angioedema but that's
 
05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
not what i'm here to talk about today
 
05:40:33.510 --> 05:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
however living with this chronic disease
 
05:40:35.590 --> 05:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
has left me with the emote emotional
 
05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
traumatizing scars
 
05:40:39.510 --> 05:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
i've been hospitalized several times and
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
each experience i've had to endure a
 
05:40:43.990 --> 05:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
sense of vulnerability alienation
 
05:40:47.350 --> 05:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
exposure and invasion of my privacy
 
05:40:49.270 --> 05:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a stigma that i carry on my
 
05:40:52.230 --> 05:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
shoulders because of this disease
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
i ask you to take a step back
 
05:40:59.190 --> 05:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:01.990 --> 05:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
for your nephew or niece
 
05:41:03.990 --> 05:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
how would you explain to any child that
 
05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that other people
 
05:41:08.470 --> 05:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
choose to be perhaps narrow-minded or
 
05:41:08.480 --> 05:41:09.990 align:start position:0%
choose to be perhaps narrow-minded or
uncomfortable

05:41:09.990 --> 05:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
05:41:12.150 --> 05:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
that she is the one who has to suffer
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
and undergo this outrageous exclusion
 
05:41:17.590 --> 05:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
my niece is a girl
 
05:41:19.830 --> 05:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
more girlier than me perhaps
 
05:41:22.310 --> 05:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
denying her and other girls like her the
 
05:41:24.390 --> 05:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
right to play sports would have a direct
 
05:41:28.470 --> 05:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
correlation to increased suicide rates
 
05:41:30.310 --> 05:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
unsupported transgender women are among
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%

with bullying depression and anxiety
 
05:41:44.948 --> 05:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
if she attempted to take her life
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%

playing sports
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
if my niece cannot play on a girl's team
 
05:41:55.350 --> 05:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
what is she supposed to do she's a kid
 
05:41:57.430 --> 05:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
children are supposed to run around with
 
05:41:59.110 --> 05:41:59.120 align:start position:0%

05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
how can she get the proper mental
 
05:42:06.150 --> 05:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
physical and social social development
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
if she does not have the opportunity to
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
interact with your peers on the
 
05:42:12.070 --> 05:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
basketball court or on the soccer field
 
05:42:14.628 --> 05:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
or at the starting line
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
we all want the same for our children
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%

i would like to present you with a
perspective

05:43:33.670 --> 05:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
perspective

one that you possibly have not
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
considered as of yet
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
i married in 1972 to a man whose path in
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
life was just beginning how does this
 
05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
relate to the proposed bill we are here
 
05:43:49.350 --> 05:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
to debate let me explain
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
as it turned out my husband became a
 
05:43:54.230 --> 05:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
beloved high school coach for the sport
 
05:43:57.190 --> 05:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
of lacrosse for 35 years
 
05:43:59.990 --> 05:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
i was totally unaware of the benefits of
 
05:44:02.470 --> 05:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
being a member of a sports team
 
05:44:05.430 --> 05:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
but over the years i became witness to
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
the countless children
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
whose lives were changed forever just
 
05:44:12.470 --> 05:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
from being actively involved in the
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
school sport
 
05:44:16.150 --> 05:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
there were the children who felt
 
05:44:19.110 --> 05:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
insecure with low self-esteem
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
there were the children who were heading
 
05:44:23.030 --> 05:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
towards a troubled and possibly criminal
 
05:44:23.040 --> 05:44:24.230 align:start position:0%
towards a troubled and possibly criminal
path

05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
path
 
05:44:25.830 --> 05:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
there were the children who were trying
 
05:44:28.470 --> 05:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
to survive the many kinds of unfortunate
 
05:44:30.390 --> 05:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
family situations
 
05:44:32.390 --> 05:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
that they had to endure
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
there were the children who were a bit
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
fooled themselves and needed to
 
05:44:35.920 --> 05:44:37.270 align:start position:0%
fooled themselves and needed to
understand

05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:44:40.470 --> 05:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
there is no eye in team there were the
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
children who were depressed deflated and
 
05:44:44.948 --> 05:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
felt alone
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
these there are many other scenarios but
 
05:44:49.670 --> 05:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
you get the picture
 
05:44:52.390 --> 05:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
the very biggest benefit for all these
 
05:44:55.270 --> 05:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
children which i witnessed on endless
 
05:44:57.910 --> 05:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
occasions was the opportunity for
 
05:45:00.310 --> 05:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
college education to those who never
 
05:45:02.948 --> 05:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
thought that was possible for them
 
05:45:05.670 --> 05:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
so many became recipients of athletic
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
college scholarships which shaped their
 
05:45:09.430 --> 05:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
lives forever
 
05:45:11.830 --> 05:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
all as a result of their hard work and
 
05:45:15.190 --> 05:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
dedication to a teen school sport
 
05:45:15.200 --> 05:45:16.708 align:start position:0%
dedication to a teen school sport
atmosphere

05:45:16.708 --> 05:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
05:45:18.868 --> 05:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
a small example of how these children
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
grew up and went on to impressive
 
05:45:22.948 --> 05:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
careers and lives
 
05:45:25.430 --> 05:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
is that when my husband passed away the
 
05:45:27.190 --> 05:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
condolences came
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
from all over the world including
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
an official documented moment of silence
 
05:45:36.390 --> 05:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
in the massachusetts state house
 
05:45:39.350 --> 05:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
over the 35 years of being involved in a
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
school sport we saw children
 
05:45:44.708 --> 05:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
grow up and become educated productive
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
and responsible adults
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
this all boils down to school sports
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
and all the lessons that they learned on
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
a team
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
and how that benefited them for their
 
05:45:58.230 --> 05:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
whole lives
 
05:46:00.868 --> 05:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
not just until the doors closed after
 
05:46:02.788 --> 05:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
they graduated
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
and now you are considering denying all
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
of these immeasurable benefits to a
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
selective group of children
 
05:46:12.628 --> 05:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
do you understand my message today i
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
hope that i have conveyed to you what
 
05:46:17.510 --> 05:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
the wonders results of being involved in
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
this school team can be
 
05:46:22.150 --> 05:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is what i wanted to bring to the
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
table today a different but very
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
important view of how children will be
 
05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
affected as this bill passes
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
please don't deny the opportunity to
 
05:46:34.868 --> 05:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
possibly change their entire adult lives
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
just because of gender identity it is so
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
terribly unfair to them
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
as i stated my husband the coach passed
 
05:46:43.200 --> 05:46:44.230 align:start position:0%
as i stated my husband the coach passed
away

05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:46:46.150 --> 05:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you were still here today you would
 
05:46:48.548 --> 05:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
be standing beside me and defending our
 
05:46:50.070 --> 05:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
very special
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
transgender granddaughter and her rights
 
05:46:56.070 --> 05:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
she is just beginning the experience of
 
05:46:58.948 --> 05:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
being a team member in a sport it should
 
05:47:01.830 --> 05:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
not be taken away from her
 
05:47:03.990 --> 05:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
simply because of the whims of a group
 
05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
of misinformed
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
hateful and discriminatory people
 
05:47:10.948 --> 05:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
please don't be the reason for this
 
05:47:13.830 --> 05:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
happening with the passage of this bill
 
05:47:20.470 --> 05:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:22.470 --> 05:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
i see no questions
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%

horrible situation that they have to go
 
05:48:24.788 --> 05:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
through just to explain themselves why
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%

opposition to hb19198
 
05:49:48.948 --> 05:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
my name is abby maxwell
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
i live in concord and i am representing
 
05:49:50.878 --> 05:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
i live in concord and i am representing
myself

05:49:52.390 --> 05:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
myself
 
05:49:54.390 --> 05:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
growing up each winter i had the
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be on a ski racing team
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
in a dark childhood it was my brightest
 
05:49:59.760 --> 05:50:00.628 align:start position:0%
in a dark childhood it was my brightest
spot

05:50:00.628 --> 05:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
spot
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i know that much of the confidence
 
05:50:04.470 --> 05:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
that carried me to adulthood was born
 
05:50:06.470 --> 05:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
directly from it
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
now i have the privilege of skiing with
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
my daughter who is eight
 
05:50:12.548 --> 05:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
this year we have frequently skied while
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
school teams are practicing
 
05:50:17.270 --> 05:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
she asks about how fast they go
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
and then she asks if she will be able to
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
race like that when she is older
 
05:50:24.150 --> 05:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
i tell her that of course she will
 
05:50:26.708 --> 05:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
knowing i will have to work so hard to
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
make my words true
 
05:50:32.390 --> 05:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
my daughter has a good happy childhood
 
05:50:35.190 --> 05:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
but she does not have an easy one
 
05:50:37.110 --> 05:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
in second grade she was bullied for her
 
05:50:39.670 --> 05:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
gender so much that the aclu and glad
 
05:50:41.910 --> 05:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
had to step in and our family had to
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
move to keep her safe she lives with the
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge that some people will not like
 
05:50:50.070 --> 05:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
her because of who she is
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
she knows that her rights are never a
 
05:50:52.638 --> 05:50:54.070 align:start position:0%
she knows that her rights are never a
given

05:50:54.070 --> 05:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
given
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
this is a lot for an eight-year-old to
 
05:50:56.240 --> 05:50:57.190 align:start position:0%
this is a lot for an eight-year-old to
carry

05:50:57.190 --> 05:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
carry
 
05:50:58.470 --> 05:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
yet somehow
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
against all odds
 
05:51:03.030 --> 05:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
my daughter continues to know that to be
 
05:51:05.910 --> 05:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
transgender is a rare but wonderful
 
05:51:05.920 --> 05:51:07.670 align:start position:0%
transgender is a rare but wonderful
thing

05:51:07.670 --> 05:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
yet my husband and i hold fast to all
 
05:51:11.590 --> 05:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
the areas where we see her confidence
 
05:51:11.600 --> 05:51:12.470 align:start position:0%
the areas where we see her confidence
grow

05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
grow
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
we don't just put money aside each year
 
05:51:16.948 --> 05:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
so she can ski because it's fun
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
we do it because we know the statistics
 
05:51:22.150 --> 05:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
that result from living in a culture
 
05:51:25.270 --> 05:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
that tells her from so many angles that
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
she is wrong
 
05:51:29.430 --> 05:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
different and unworthy
 
05:51:31.030 --> 05:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
we know that something as simple as
 
05:51:34.230 --> 05:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
skiing could save her life
 
05:51:36.070 --> 05:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
my daughter is a girl
 
05:51:37.990 --> 05:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
she will not grow up to race with the
 
05:51:38.000 --> 05:51:39.110 align:start position:0%
she will not grow up to race with the
boys

05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
boys
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
and to ask her to is an act of bullying
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
and exclusion
 
05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
so before you vote i would urge you to
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
imagine what it might be like to look
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
into my daughter's eyes
 
05:51:52.868 --> 05:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
and to tell her that no in fact she will
 
05:51:55.190 --> 05:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to race or play any sport
 
05:51:57.910 --> 05:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
when she is older because adults in her
 
05:52:00.070 --> 05:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
community believe there is something
 
05:52:02.310 --> 05:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous about her
 
05:52:04.868 --> 05:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
if you did that you would be forced to
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
see how cruel this bill is
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
i urge you to oppose hb 198
 
05:52:12.390 --> 05:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
and instead to continue the work of
 
05:52:14.310 --> 05:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
building a new hampshire that lives up
 
05:52:16.470 --> 05:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
to the values we all try to teach our
 
05:52:16.480 --> 05:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
to the values we all try to teach our
children

05:52:17.510 --> 05:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:22.150 --> 05:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:52:38.070 --> 05:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.160 --> 05:52:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:52:51.990 --> 05:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:52.000 --> 05:52:53.030 align:start position:0%
um
hello

05:52:53.030 --> 05:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
hello
 
05:52:54.470 --> 05:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
hi i'm ryan
 
05:52:56.470 --> 05:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay just making sure that that works uh
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
so i am
 
05:53:01.510 --> 05:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
emily from dover here opposing hp129
 
05:53:04.390 --> 05:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh i'm a transgender woman myself i'm a
 
05:53:07.590 --> 05:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
doctoral student at unh working on my
 
05:53:09.830 --> 05:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
degree phd in physics
 
05:53:12.070 --> 05:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i've also been a distance runner for
 
05:53:14.230 --> 05:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years since i was in high
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
school myself i was on cross-country in
 
05:53:17.350 --> 05:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
high school and i've been running ever
 
05:53:17.360 --> 05:53:18.628 align:start position:0%
high school and i've been running ever
since

05:53:18.628 --> 05:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:53:21.670 --> 05:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to object to the notion that
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
trans women would dominate women's
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
sports i've been in the same sports
 
05:53:27.990 --> 05:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
before and after transition
 
05:53:29.670 --> 05:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
and as was previously stated trans
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
people tend to
 
05:53:31.600 --> 05:53:32.548 align:start position:0%
people tend to
perform

05:53:32.548 --> 05:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
perform
 
05:53:32.558 --> 05:53:33.990 align:start position:0%
perform
similarly

05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
05:53:35.910 --> 05:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
pre-transition as they do a
 
05:53:35.920 --> 05:53:37.430 align:start position:0%
pre-transition as they do a
post-transition

05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
post-transition
 
05:53:39.990 --> 05:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh pre-transition my run times for a 5k
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
which is five kilometers roughly 3.1
 
05:53:42.718 --> 05:53:43.910 align:start position:0%
which is five kilometers roughly 3.1
miles

05:53:43.910 --> 05:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
miles
 
05:53:46.868 --> 05:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
uh was about 28 minutes pre-transition
 
05:53:49.270 --> 05:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
which is roughly slightly below average
 
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
for male 1
 
05:53:51.040 --> 05:53:52.150 align:start position:0%
for male 1
standards

05:53:52.150 --> 05:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
i actually ran one yesterday uh which is
 
05:53:59.190 --> 05:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
i timed it 37 minutes which as it turns
 
05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
out is slightly again slightly below the
 
05:54:03.670 --> 05:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
female average
 
05:54:03.680 --> 05:54:04.548 align:start position:0%
female average
for

05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:54:07.590 --> 05:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh 5k times for women in my age bracket
 
05:54:07.600 --> 05:54:08.788 align:start position:0%
uh 5k times for women in my age bracket
so

05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:54:13.510 --> 05:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
my experience alone just says that it is
 
05:54:15.270 --> 05:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
very misguided to operate on the
 
05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
presumption that being transgender would
 
05:54:19.110 --> 05:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
automatically give me an advantage for
 
05:54:21.350 --> 05:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
me it certainly does not
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
and and thus a bill that
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
is such
 
05:54:27.350 --> 05:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
predicated on such a generalization i
 
05:54:30.390 --> 05:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
think is very much a mistake
 
05:54:32.470 --> 05:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
but having also been a distance runner
 
05:54:34.948 --> 05:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
for the last decade i will say that
 
05:54:36.310 --> 05:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
participating in sport has been a
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous benefit both to my scholastic
 
05:54:40.830 --> 05:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
achievement and my mental health
 
05:54:44.150 --> 05:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh when i am struggling with problems in
 
05:54:46.470 --> 05:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
research comprehensive exams or other
 
05:54:48.788 --> 05:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
coursework related to graduate school i
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
will sometimes go out and run just for
 
05:54:54.230 --> 05:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
two hours just to clear my head and
 
05:54:56.310 --> 05:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
get my endorphins up i've found that's
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
been invaluable to my studies and my
 
05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
career success long term i also have
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
plenty of wonderful memories from my
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
time as a high school student and all
 
05:55:08.230 --> 05:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
the friends that i made
 
05:55:10.150 --> 05:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
running cross-country back then and i
 
05:55:13.030 --> 05:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
would hate to deny any future future
 
05:55:15.270 --> 05:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
trans girls and trans women the same
 
05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities that i would have that i
 
05:55:19.750 --> 05:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
was afforded in running sports
 
05:55:23.110 --> 05:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
especially because um i know that
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
had i figured out sooner than i did that
 
05:55:26.708 --> 05:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
i was trans i definitely would not have
 
05:55:31.110 --> 05:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
so given that in good conscience i
 
05:55:34.708 --> 05:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
cannot support a bill like this and urge
 
05:55:37.110 --> 05:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote against it
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
i see no questions so
 
05:55:47.990 --> 05:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay next we have battle lawyer welcome
 
05:55:55.350 --> 05:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:57.590 --> 05:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
hi thank you everyone here let me start
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
my video
 
05:56:01.910 --> 05:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for uh hearing my testimony
 
05:56:04.070 --> 05:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
and uh thanks to emily i'm happy happy
 
05:56:06.548 --> 05:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
to follow a fellow distance runner so
 
05:56:08.708 --> 05:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
i'm val moyer i'm a former collegiate
 
05:56:11.350 --> 05:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
runner at university of vermont and i'm
 
05:56:13.350 --> 05:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
currently a phd candidate in women's
 
05:56:15.510 --> 05:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
gender and sexuality studies and my
 
05:56:17.110 --> 05:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
dissertation looks at transgender
 
05:56:18.548 --> 05:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
participation policies at the
 
05:56:20.230 --> 05:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
international level for women's track
 
05:56:22.708 --> 05:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
and field so i am here today to strongly
 
05:56:24.390 --> 05:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
05:56:26.150 --> 05:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm also open to
 
05:56:27.750 --> 05:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions on my research but i chose to
 
05:56:27.760 --> 05:56:28.708 align:start position:0%
questions on my research but i chose to
go

05:56:28.708 --> 05:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:56:30.230 --> 05:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
for a more personal route for this
 
05:56:30.240 --> 05:56:31.510 align:start position:0%
for a more personal route for this
testimony

05:56:31.510 --> 05:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:56:33.350 --> 05:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'm a cisgender woman meaning that i
 
05:56:36.548 --> 05:56:36.558 align:start position:0%
identify with my assigned sex at birth
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
and in high school i trained hard and i
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
was good at running but i was far from
 
05:56:42.868 --> 05:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
state podiums in my home state of
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
virginia i wasn't making headlines no
 
05:56:46.628 --> 05:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
one knew my name
 
05:56:48.310 --> 05:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
but i got recruited to a division one
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
program on a partial scholarship
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
i bring this up to say that thanks to
 
05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
title ix there are spots and
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
scholarships thousands of them across
 
05:56:59.910 --> 05:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
the country for women who do well
 
05:57:01.910 --> 05:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
in high school sports and that this
 
05:57:04.868 --> 05:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
should absolutely not be the main point
 
05:57:07.190 --> 05:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
of high school sports which should
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
be supportive and inclusive spaces for
 
05:57:09.200 --> 05:57:10.390 align:start position:0%
be supportive and inclusive spaces for
everyone

05:57:10.390 --> 05:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
05:57:12.070 --> 05:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
but the idea that trans girls are
 
05:57:15.190 --> 05:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
somehow swooping in and dominating
 
05:57:17.350 --> 05:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
is ludicrous it's a scare tactic that's
 
05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
not based in reality because one trans
 
05:57:22.470 --> 05:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
girls are girls and two because
 
05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
recruiting on college teams is an
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
individual process which mostly depends
 
05:57:29.110 --> 05:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
on communication between college coaches
 
05:57:33.030 --> 05:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:33.040 --> 05:57:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:57:34.070 --> 05:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:37.110 --> 05:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
during my time at uvm um the ncaa has
 
05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
had a trans-inclusion policy in place
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
since 2011 and many people including
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
myself have worked hard in the decades
 
05:57:45.750 --> 05:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
since to ensure that this was followed
 
05:57:47.350 --> 05:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
on the ground within athletic
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
departments so that all student athletes
 
05:57:51.750 --> 05:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
feel welcome and accepted on their team
 
05:57:54.230 --> 05:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would undo all of that work
 
05:57:56.548 --> 05:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
and it would move us backwards
 
05:57:57.750 --> 05:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
all the effort in writing and
 
05:57:59.750 --> 05:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislating this bill is frankly a waste
 
05:58:02.150 --> 05:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
of time and it's only harmful
 
05:58:03.910 --> 05:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
it is addressing a problem that doesn't
 
05:58:06.310 --> 05:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
exist there are many problems facing
 
05:58:08.788 --> 05:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
women's sports from sexual harassment to
 
05:58:10.868 --> 05:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
inequitable funding media coverage
 
05:58:12.230 --> 05:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
gender equity in coaching and
 
05:58:14.548 --> 05:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
administration but trans girls and women
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
competing are not one of those problems
 
05:58:19.270 --> 05:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
as a society we need to accept the fact
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
that trans women are women and trans
 
05:58:22.708 --> 05:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
girls are girls
 
05:58:24.390 --> 05:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
so then the question boils down to
 
05:58:25.910 --> 05:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
should girls be allowed to compete with
 
05:58:28.230 --> 05:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
other girls and the answer is yes
 
05:58:28.240 --> 05:58:29.270 align:start position:0%
other girls and the answer is yes
therefore

05:58:29.270 --> 05:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:58:30.470 --> 05:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
i cannot
 
05:58:32.390 --> 05:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
support this bill going forward into the
 
05:58:32.400 --> 05:58:33.590 align:start position:0%
support this bill going forward into the
legislation

05:58:33.590 --> 05:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:58:38.788 --> 05:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:42.868 --> 05:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:45.030 --> 05:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
05:58:47.350 --> 05:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh and thank you miss moyer for
 
05:58:49.830 --> 05:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
coming in and testifying you referenced
 
05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
research that you've done and it sounds
 
05:58:54.150 --> 05:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
like you've devoted a fair amount of
 
05:58:56.070 --> 05:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
time to the topic
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
is it possible do you have any
 
05:59:02.788 --> 05:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
sort of reference sheets or uh
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
cliff notes on on data if you will that
 
05:59:07.670 --> 05:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
you could send to the committee
 
05:59:10.470 --> 05:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the number of incidences and
 
05:59:10.480 --> 05:59:11.750 align:start position:0%
regarding the number of incidences and
outcomes

05:59:11.750 --> 05:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
05:59:14.548 --> 05:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely um i can pull kind of a
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
lit review and send it um to the
 
05:59:17.990 --> 05:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee for sure but i do want to
 
05:59:19.350 --> 05:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
clarify i heard a couple questions at
 
05:59:20.708 --> 05:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
05:59:22.708 --> 05:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
there have not been any instances in the
 
05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
history of women's sports of modern
 
05:59:27.590 --> 05:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
women's sports of um
 
05:59:29.910 --> 05:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
people transitioning to female simply
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
for for the purpose of performance
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
advantage um that has not happened
 
05:59:37.030 --> 05:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
i can say that outright so thank you so
 
05:59:39.830 --> 05:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:45.030 --> 05:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:47.110 --> 05:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:58.708 --> 05:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
excellent all right thank you very much
 
06:00:00.548 --> 06:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
my name is james porter i'm a resident
 
06:00:02.948 --> 06:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
of manchester new hampshire i've also
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
been a youth sports coach for the last
 
06:00:07.190 --> 06:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
25 years
 
06:00:09.670 --> 06:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
including high school cross-country and
 
06:00:09.680 --> 06:00:11.190 align:start position:0%
including high school cross-country and
track

06:00:11.190 --> 06:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
track
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of the manchester school
 
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
board although i'm not here representing
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
them today but we did pass a
 
06:00:19.270 --> 06:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
transgender non-binary policy that i'm
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
very proud of uh and i'm also married to
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
a physician who in 2004 was voted the
 
06:00:26.230 --> 06:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
top family practice doc in the state by
 
06:00:28.628 --> 06:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
her peers so when we were discussing
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
this policy i did a really really deep
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
dive i'm a bit of a research dork
 
06:00:35.110 --> 06:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
and really got into it and i'm here
 
06:00:37.830 --> 06:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
today to strongly oppose this bill
 
06:00:40.070 --> 06:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh on three basic points number one is
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
the law
 
06:00:43.990 --> 06:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
as we heard earlier in the bostock
 
06:00:45.670 --> 06:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruling which was six to
 
06:00:45.680 --> 06:00:47.350 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruling which was six to
three

06:00:47.350 --> 06:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
three
 
06:00:49.830 --> 06:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
trump appointed justice neil gorsuch
 
06:00:51.750 --> 06:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
said it was illegal to discriminate
 
06:00:53.670 --> 06:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
based on gender identity and the
 
06:00:55.350 --> 06:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
constitution guarantees the right of
 
06:00:57.670 --> 06:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
equal protection under the law so i
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
believe that this is illegal on a
 
06:01:00.708 --> 06:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
06:01:03.030 --> 06:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
number two i think uh it's important to
 
06:01:04.788 --> 06:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
really listen to the doctors and i know
 
06:01:06.548 --> 06:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
we heard a someone from the american
 
06:01:08.548 --> 06:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
academy of pediatrics
 
06:01:11.030 --> 06:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
their 2018 report
 
06:01:13.350 --> 06:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
stated that trans kids face disparities
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
from inequitable laws and policies
 
06:01:17.670 --> 06:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
social discrimination access to health
 
06:01:20.230 --> 06:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
care and opportunities for successes and
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
they urged lawmakers to pass
 
06:01:24.948 --> 06:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
proactive policies and protections that
 
06:01:26.708 --> 06:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
promote inclusion
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
and safety including access to bathrooms
 
06:01:29.600 --> 06:01:30.628 align:start position:0%
and safety including access to bathrooms
clubs

06:01:30.628 --> 06:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
clubs
 
06:01:32.948 --> 06:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
high school sports teams locker rooms
 
06:01:34.470 --> 06:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
and everything that corresponds with
 
06:01:36.628 --> 06:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
their gender identity so from
 
06:01:38.150 --> 06:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
listening to the doctors about what they
 
06:01:39.670 --> 06:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
think we need to do about the kids that
 
06:01:41.350 --> 06:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
are most at risk
 
06:01:44.070 --> 06:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
they seem to be fully in support of that
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
also in terms of like the the locker
 
06:01:47.510 --> 06:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
room policy i think it's important to
 
06:01:49.590 --> 06:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
note for the safety of kids
 
06:01:51.590 --> 06:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's a huge component about sexual
 
06:01:53.430 --> 06:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
assault that happens
 
06:01:55.670 --> 06:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
and if you pass policies that give them
 
06:01:55.680 --> 06:01:58.230 align:start position:0%
and if you pass policies that give them
protections

06:01:58.230 --> 06:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
protections
 
06:01:59.910 --> 06:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
you basically decrease their risk of
 
06:02:01.190 --> 06:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
being sexually assaulted and i think
 
06:02:02.390 --> 06:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's important
 
06:02:04.548 --> 06:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
lastly is just the human element i've
 
06:02:06.788 --> 06:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
coached transgender athletes
 
06:02:08.310 --> 06:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you from the bottom of my
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
heart they just want to be on a team
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
they want to go to a pasta party on a
 
06:02:13.910 --> 06:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
friday night they want to high-five
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
their teammates and talk about watching
 
06:02:18.310 --> 06:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
the office on netflix the night before
 
06:02:18.320 --> 06:02:19.510 align:start position:0%
the office on netflix the night before
um

06:02:19.510 --> 06:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
and seeing the reaction of parents you
 
06:02:23.190 --> 06:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
know at team parties i mean they were
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
crying because for the first time in
 
06:02:25.670 --> 06:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
their life
 
06:02:28.470 --> 06:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
their kid felt a connection to other
 
06:02:31.110 --> 06:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
kids and i i just think that this policy
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
is a hundred percent wrong and you know
 
06:02:35.590 --> 06:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
other people have said things uh you
 
06:02:37.830 --> 06:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
know it's a solution in looking for a
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
problem and that's basically it there is
 
06:02:42.390 --> 06:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
no domination going on i haven't seen it
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
in 25 years transgender athletes have
 
06:02:46.708 --> 06:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
been around this whole time
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so i i strongly uh oppose it and i'm
 
06:02:52.230 --> 06:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions uh and i
 
06:02:54.310 --> 06:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
have an answer for a previous one if the
 
06:02:57.190 --> 06:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
chair would allow thank you
 
06:02:57.200 --> 06:02:59.110 align:start position:0%
chair would allow thank you
um

06:02:59.110 --> 06:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:02.310 --> 06:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
can you make that point
 
06:03:04.310 --> 06:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
sure uh some somebody had asked if there
 
06:03:06.470 --> 06:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
was ever a trans man
 
06:03:08.548 --> 06:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
that had quote unquote dominated and
 
06:03:11.670 --> 06:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
chris moser uh is a three-time national
 
06:03:13.910 --> 06:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
champion in the biathlon and the
 
06:03:16.470 --> 06:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
triathlon and has represented the united
 
06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
states at the net at the international
 
06:03:21.910 --> 06:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
level six times um so that that has that
 
06:03:23.590 --> 06:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
has happened thank you
 
06:03:26.230 --> 06:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i see no questions
 
06:03:46.708 --> 06:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:46.718 --> 06:03:58.788 align:start position:0%
 
but

06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:00.788 --> 06:04:00.798 align:start position:0%
excuse me can you hear me now
 
06:04:00.798 --> 06:04:02.948 align:start position:0%
excuse me can you hear me now
yes

06:04:02.948 --> 06:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:04:06.310 --> 06:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay i'm dr jennifer smith i'm a retired
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
family physician
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
um and i'm here to oppose this bill and
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
i have sent in testimony i hope that you
 
06:04:17.430 --> 06:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
will read it there is a link to an
 
06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
article there and i will emphasize that
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
because everything else i have
 
06:04:24.470 --> 06:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
come to say has been said before and i
 
06:04:26.708 --> 06:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to reiterate but all of the
 
06:04:29.590 --> 06:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
other opposition is quite correct
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
there is this question about whether
 
06:04:35.430 --> 06:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
there is an advantage if perhaps someone
 
06:04:37.750 --> 06:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
transitioned partway through
 
06:04:37.760 --> 06:04:38.708 align:start position:0%
transitioned partway through
their

06:04:38.708 --> 06:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
high school or junior high
 
06:04:44.470 --> 06:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
from having had testosterone and while
 
06:04:46.788 --> 06:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
there might be some temporary advantage
 
06:04:49.030 --> 06:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
it clearly is something that would turn
 
06:04:51.590 --> 06:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
around and i would also point out that
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
exogenous testosterone that is
 
06:04:55.510 --> 06:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
testosterone given
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
by injection or by transcutaneous
 
06:04:59.040 --> 06:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
by injection or by transcutaneous
patches

06:05:00.230 --> 06:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
patches
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
is something that a girl who was born a
 
06:05:04.868 --> 06:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
girl could use too
 
06:05:08.470 --> 06:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
if someone was really intent on cheating
 
06:05:11.190 --> 06:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
but in fact when people's testosterone
 
06:05:13.910 --> 06:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
is suppressed as all transgender girls
 
06:05:17.350 --> 06:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
will want their testosterone suppressed
 
06:05:20.390 --> 06:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
um then it goes down and it does not
 
06:05:22.708 --> 06:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
continue the advantage and we all know
 
06:05:24.310 --> 06:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
that the skeletal
 
06:05:27.030 --> 06:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
differences height and so forth are are
 
06:05:29.750 --> 06:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
really very much a broad spectrum and
 
06:05:31.510 --> 06:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
much overlap
 
06:05:34.150 --> 06:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
um and the article that i sent you um
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
suggested that if you were going to use
 
06:05:36.558 --> 06:05:37.590 align:start position:0%
suggested that if you were going to use
levels

06:05:37.590 --> 06:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
levels
 
06:05:37.600 --> 06:05:38.628 align:start position:0%
levels
of

06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:05:41.670 --> 06:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
hormones to decide who could compete as
 
06:05:43.830 --> 06:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
a girl that maybe the upper limit of
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
testosterone should be five
 
06:05:49.430 --> 06:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
but it also pointed out that in fact
 
06:05:51.510 --> 06:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
most women
 
06:05:55.270 --> 06:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
fully pubertal girls and women are at
 
06:05:57.430 --> 06:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
1.7 or less
 
06:05:59.830 --> 06:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
so there's actually a marked disparity
 
06:06:01.590 --> 06:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
and that's because there are a small
 
06:06:03.510 --> 06:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
percentage back to a fairly decent
 
06:06:06.150 --> 06:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of women and girls who have
 
06:06:08.470 --> 06:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
polycystic ovary syndrome
 
06:06:12.788 --> 06:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
which causes high levels of testosterone
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
and in fact they are over represented
 
06:06:17.750 --> 06:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
among elite athletes
 
06:06:20.868 --> 06:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
so there is in fact the possibility that
 
06:06:22.948 --> 06:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
the girls in connecticut who are
 
06:06:25.990 --> 06:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
objecting to trans girls running against
 
06:06:26.000 --> 06:06:26.868 align:start position:0%
objecting to trans girls running against
them

06:06:26.868 --> 06:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:06:29.430 --> 06:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
were in fact themselves at higher
 
06:06:31.910 --> 06:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
testosterone levels than the trans girls
 
06:06:33.910 --> 06:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
they were competing against
 
06:06:36.788 --> 06:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of a strange bill
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
that has no basis in fact and you need
 
06:06:42.708 --> 06:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
to itl it thank you and i'd be happy to
 
06:06:44.310 --> 06:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:06:50.548 --> 06:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
i uh do not see any questions so thank
 
06:07:06.788 --> 06:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:32.628 --> 06:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:34.070 --> 06:07:34.080 align:start position:0%

my name is jonathan weinberg um i'll
 
06:09:50.948 --> 06:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
make this brief because i think everyone
 
06:09:53.750 --> 06:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
else has had various substantive uh
 
06:09:56.070 --> 06:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
testimonies i'm a recently elected
 
06:09:57.990 --> 06:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
member of the concord school board but
 
06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking my capacity as an
 
06:10:01.270 --> 06:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
individual and not on behalf of the
 
06:10:01.280 --> 06:10:02.310 align:start position:0%
individual and not on behalf of the
board

06:10:02.310 --> 06:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:10:03.830 --> 06:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
06:10:06.548 --> 06:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
we've heard a very heart-wrenching and
 
06:10:08.708 --> 06:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
also very impactful testimonies from
 
06:10:11.590 --> 06:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
everyone and just as public servants
 
06:10:13.590 --> 06:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
especially as one in education i'm
 
06:10:15.110 --> 06:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
committed to using my position to fight
 
06:10:16.390 --> 06:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
to make new hampshire schools more
 
06:10:17.430 --> 06:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
inclusive and
 
06:10:19.190 --> 06:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
equitable for all students
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
as i imagine each of you are fighting
 
06:10:24.070 --> 06:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
for your constituents who would be
 
06:10:26.070 --> 06:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
adversely impacted by the passage of
 
06:10:28.628 --> 06:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
06:10:30.230 --> 06:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
protecting the rights of students should
 
06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
be a primary duty of elected officials
 
06:10:34.390 --> 06:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
legislators and community members
 
06:10:36.788 --> 06:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
i just urge everyone to think about the
 
06:10:38.470 --> 06:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
stories you heard today
 
06:10:38.480 --> 06:10:39.510 align:start position:0%

and
 
06:10:41.190 --> 06:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
think about how everyone will be
 
06:10:43.430 --> 06:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
impacted and i urge you to
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
vote this bill and expedient to
 
06:10:44.878 --> 06:10:46.070 align:start position:0%

country this bill was founded in
 
06:12:01.590 --> 06:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
disinformation and for the sake of not

another roadblock being introduced

um i don't have
 
06:16:39.430 --> 06:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
much to add to
 
06:16:41.910 --> 06:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
the powerful testimony that you have
 
06:16:41.920 --> 06:16:42.868 align:start position:0%
the powerful testimony that you have
heard

06:16:42.868 --> 06:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:16:45.750 --> 06:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
06:16:48.830 --> 06:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
it is not unusual when
 
06:16:51.750 --> 06:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination is achieved by a
 
06:16:53.830 --> 06:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
variety of minorities
 
06:16:56.230 --> 06:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
for there to be pushback
 
06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is that kind of pushback
 
06:17:02.868 --> 06:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important to remember
 
06:17:02.878 --> 06:17:04.390 align:start position:0%
but i think it's important to remember
that

06:17:04.390 --> 06:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:17:08.230 --> 06:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
minorities have worked hard to achieve
 
06:17:10.708 --> 06:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
equality have worked hard to achieve
 
06:17:10.718 --> 06:17:13.110 align:start position:0%
equality have worked hard to achieve
non-discrimination

06:17:13.110 --> 06:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination
 
06:17:15.510 --> 06:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
06:17:17.910 --> 06:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
that non-discrimination should not be
 
06:17:17.920 --> 06:17:19.430 align:start position:0%
that non-discrimination should not be
undone

06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
undone
 
06:17:22.310 --> 06:17:22.320 align:start position:0%

06:18:55.040 --> 06:18:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
24

06:18:56.310 --> 06:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
24
 
06:18:56.320 --> 06:19:01.590 align:start position:0%
24
um

06:19:01.590 --> 06:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:05.190 --> 06:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
so that will end our hearing on uh hp
 
06:19:24.390 --> 06:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:37.190 --> 06:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:38.830 --> 06:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:19:41.830 --> 06:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes we're going to
 
06:19:45.030 --> 06:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh go back now and take up hb 276 this
 
06:19:47.350 --> 06:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
is the bill relative to availability of
 
06:19:50.150 --> 06:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
menstrual hygiene products and schools
 
06:19:53.190 --> 06:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
that also has a second part in that bill
 
06:19:55.350 --> 06:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is in the analysis that this bill
 
06:19:57.270 --> 06:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
also provides the school districts may
 
06:19:59.190 --> 06:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
seek state reimbursement
 
06:20:02.310 --> 06:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
to fulfill this obligation
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
so with that i believe we have uh six
 
06:20:10.150 --> 06:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
people that were signed up to um testify
 
06:20:13.430 --> 06:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
on that particular bill on this bill
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:20:17.350 --> 06:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
it looks that way
 
06:20:20.310 --> 06:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
and he did not have the sponsors to
 
06:20:22.150 --> 06:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
introduce it was introduced by ralph
 
06:20:25.110 --> 06:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
holm representative bone so at this
 
06:20:27.110 --> 06:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
point in time i'm opening it up now to
 
06:20:31.030 --> 06:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:32.868 --> 06:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
indicate that they like to testify on
 
06:20:46.070 --> 06:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:48.390 --> 06:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
let's recognize representative edwards
 
06:20:50.868 --> 06:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
06:20:52.868 --> 06:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
yeah hello uh this is representative
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
jess edwards representing auburn chester
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and sandown uh i'm here today uh
 
06:21:03.030 --> 06:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
introducing hb 276
 
06:21:05.910 --> 06:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh i've talked to the committee before
 
06:21:05.920 --> 06:21:06.868 align:start position:0%
uh i've talked to the committee before
on

06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:21:10.708 --> 06:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
pretty much exactly the same ground so
 
06:21:12.628 --> 06:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
much of this is gonna be a repeat and
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
therefore i can i can go through it
 
06:21:17.430 --> 06:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly i think um
 
06:21:19.910 --> 06:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's a very similar
 
06:21:22.628 --> 06:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
to a representative judy aaron's bill
 
06:21:25.030 --> 06:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
that she that she introduced like maybe
 
06:21:26.548 --> 06:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago
 
06:21:26.558 --> 06:21:27.670 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago
but

06:21:27.670 --> 06:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:21:27.680 --> 06:21:28.548 align:start position:0%
but
um

06:21:28.548 --> 06:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:31.750 --> 06:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
i um this bill originated when i was
 
06:21:34.868 --> 06:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
talking last year to senator sharon
 
06:21:34.878 --> 06:21:35.910 align:start position:0%
talking last year to senator sharon
carson

06:21:35.910 --> 06:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
carson
 
06:21:38.470 --> 06:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
who was incensed that she couldn't get
 
06:21:42.628 --> 06:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
the senate to recognize that the way the
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
bill was crafted that came through
 
06:21:45.120 --> 06:21:46.548 align:start position:0%
bill was crafted that came through
mandating

06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
06:21:49.110 --> 06:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
the public schools to have
 
06:21:51.910 --> 06:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
female hygiene products on hand
 
06:21:54.390 --> 06:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh and for them to be made available uh
 
06:21:57.510 --> 06:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
for free uh based on using vending
 
06:22:00.230 --> 06:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
machines in the bathrooms all bathrooms
 
06:22:03.910 --> 06:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh she she was incensed that the the
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue here is pretty
 
06:22:06.948 --> 06:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
clear in
 
06:22:11.190 --> 06:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
article 28 a under mandated programs and
 
06:22:13.670 --> 06:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
i won't read it to you but it passed in
 
06:22:13.680 --> 06:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
i won't read it to you but it passed in
1984

06:22:15.270 --> 06:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
1984
 
06:22:17.350 --> 06:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
and it essentially says
 
06:22:17.360 --> 06:22:18.628 align:start position:0%
and it essentially says
that

06:22:18.628 --> 06:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
the legislature can do whatever it wants
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
and mandate whatever it wants it just
 
06:22:25.430 --> 06:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
needs to pay for it and uh this the the
 
06:22:27.510 --> 06:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
way the bill got passed
 
06:22:29.350 --> 06:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
it was the
 
06:22:33.190 --> 06:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
perfect storm between requiring
 
06:22:35.110 --> 06:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
action on the part of the school
 
06:22:35.120 --> 06:22:36.230 align:start position:0%
action on the part of the school
districts

06:22:36.230 --> 06:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
districts
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
and then insisting that there's no way
 
06:22:40.150 --> 06:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
the state would pay for it so it was
 
06:22:42.948 --> 06:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
almost an arrogant unfunded mandate
 
06:22:42.958 --> 06:22:43.750 align:start position:0%
almost an arrogant unfunded mandate
and

06:22:43.750 --> 06:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:44.708 --> 06:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
i i think there's two ways that the
 
06:22:49.830 --> 06:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
education committee could go on on
 
06:22:51.110 --> 06:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
fixing this
 
06:22:55.190 --> 06:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh one is hb 276 which essentially
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
says uh
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
this is not a mandate but it's a really
 
06:23:01.030 --> 06:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
great suggestion you ought to do it
 
06:23:01.040 --> 06:23:01.990 align:start position:0%
great suggestion you ought to do it
or

06:23:01.990 --> 06:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:23:03.830 --> 06:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
the alternative would be
 
06:23:03.840 --> 06:23:05.830 align:start position:0%
the alternative would be
to

06:23:05.830 --> 06:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:23:08.390 --> 06:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
amend it and
 
06:23:10.548 --> 06:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
pay for it in which case
 
06:23:12.470 --> 06:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh it would need to come over to finance
 
06:23:13.990 --> 06:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
and we'd have to figure out how we would
 
06:23:15.110 --> 06:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
06:23:19.510 --> 06:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
so um so that's it we there you know
 
06:23:19.520 --> 06:23:20.230 align:start position:0%
so um so that's it we there you know
if

06:23:20.230 --> 06:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:23:22.390 --> 06:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
if we mandate it as a state we have to
 
06:23:25.510 --> 06:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
pay for it the current rsa
 
06:23:28.708 --> 06:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
mandates it and doesn't pay for it and
 
06:23:31.510 --> 06:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's really up to us to fix it um and
 
06:23:33.990 --> 06:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
with that i'll uh i'll take questions if
 
06:23:35.270 --> 06:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
06:23:36.548 --> 06:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
06:23:38.070 --> 06:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
edwards are there questions for
 
06:23:42.548 --> 06:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:42.558 --> 06:23:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
not

06:23:43.270 --> 06:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:23:46.230 --> 06:23:46.240 align:start position:0%

new hampshire action fund and planned
 
06:24:29.910 --> 06:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
parenthood of northern new england and
 
06:24:31.430 --> 06:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
we've submitted our testimony through
 
06:24:32.628 --> 06:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
email as well
 
06:24:34.868 --> 06:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
we urge you to vote itl on house bill
 
06:24:34.878 --> 06:24:36.470 align:start position:0%
we urge you to vote itl on house bill
276.

06:24:36.470 --> 06:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
276.
 
06:24:39.030 --> 06:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
you already know the background in 2019
 
06:24:42.070 --> 06:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
this body passed senate bill 142 which
 
06:24:43.750 --> 06:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
required new hampshire public high
 
06:24:45.510 --> 06:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
school and middle schools to make
 
06:24:47.750 --> 06:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
menstruation products available at no
 
06:24:49.750 --> 06:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
cost in girls restrooms and gender
 
06:24:51.350 --> 06:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
neutral restrooms
 
06:24:53.350 --> 06:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
that bill passed with broad bipartisan
 
06:24:56.150 --> 06:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
support and when governor sununu signed
 
06:24:58.548 --> 06:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
that bill into law he said that it would
 
06:25:00.628 --> 06:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
ensure students could quote learn
 
06:25:03.430 --> 06:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
without disruption and free of shame or
 
06:25:05.830 --> 06:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
fear of stigma end quote
 
06:25:08.868 --> 06:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
house bill 276 however would no longer
 
06:25:10.628 --> 06:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
require public schools to offer
 
06:25:12.310 --> 06:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
menstrual products in spaces that are
 
06:25:13.830 --> 06:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
accessible without students needing to
 
06:25:15.110 --> 06:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
ask someone
 
06:25:18.310 --> 06:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
this bill instead asks districts to make
 
06:25:20.070 --> 06:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts
 
06:25:21.750 --> 06:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
this change would bring us back to
 
06:25:24.230 --> 06:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
before the passage of senate bill 142 in
 
06:25:26.868 --> 06:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
2019 and would be a major step back in
 
06:25:28.868 --> 06:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
our state for menstrual equity and
 
06:25:30.470 --> 06:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
reducing unnecessary
 
06:25:32.470 --> 06:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
classroom disruptions
 
06:25:33.990 --> 06:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
let's be clear
 
06:25:36.230 --> 06:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
providing no-cost menstruation products
 
06:25:38.390 --> 06:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
in public schools decreases learning
 
06:25:40.548 --> 06:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
interruptions which is good for students
 
06:25:42.470 --> 06:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
and good for educators and good for
 
06:25:45.270 --> 06:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
schools overall i've heard mention of
 
06:25:47.270 --> 06:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
costs as a prohibitive barrier for
 
06:25:48.628 --> 06:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
06:25:51.350 --> 06:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
the law went into effect in 2019
 
06:25:54.230 --> 06:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
which means initial and one-time costs
 
06:25:56.708 --> 06:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
for implementation were likely incurred
 
06:25:58.390 --> 06:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
additionally the law did not require
 
06:26:03.750 --> 06:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
machines to be installed in bathrooms
 
06:26:05.350 --> 06:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
districts and schools could provide
 
06:26:07.270 --> 06:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
something as simple as a basket with
 
06:26:10.070 --> 06:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
tampons and pads in restrooms
 
06:26:11.910 --> 06:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
in order to enable students to practice
 
06:26:14.070 --> 06:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
proper hygiene we expect schools to
 
06:26:16.470 --> 06:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
supply toilet paper soap and towels or
 
06:26:18.548 --> 06:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
dryers at no cost to students
 
06:26:20.708 --> 06:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
we don't ask for reasonable efforts to
 
06:26:22.628 --> 06:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
insure those products we expect
 
06:26:24.628 --> 06:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
districts to provide them
 
06:26:26.390 --> 06:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
we should similarly expect schools to
 
06:26:28.230 --> 06:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
supply products needed by students who
 
06:26:29.830 --> 06:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
are menstruating
 
06:26:32.788 --> 06:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
in short house bill 276 would again
 
06:26:34.628 --> 06:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
increase barriers for students and
 
06:26:36.868 --> 06:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
barriers that will occur regularly and
 
06:26:36.878 --> 06:26:37.990 align:start position:0%
barriers that will occur regularly and
monthly

06:26:37.990 --> 06:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
06:26:39.590 --> 06:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
the goal should be to support students
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
in feeling safe and comfortable in their
 
06:26:42.628 --> 06:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
school buildings without feeling
 
06:26:45.590 --> 06:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
stigmatized or st or singled out
 
06:26:47.510 --> 06:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire already has that law on
 
06:26:49.350 --> 06:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
the books and other states and countries
 
06:26:51.430 --> 06:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
have been following our lead let's not
 
06:26:53.670 --> 06:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
roll back progress we ask that you vote
 
06:26:55.590 --> 06:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on house bill
 
06:26:55.600 --> 06:26:57.590 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on house bill
276

06:26:57.590 --> 06:26:57.600 align:start position:0%

06:26:59.750 --> 06:26:59.760 align:start position:0%

06:27:17.110 --> 06:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:19.990 --> 06:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
hello members of the education committee
 
06:27:21.990 --> 06:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
my name is abby whitcomb and i am an
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
alum of the londonderry school district
 
06:27:27.270 --> 06:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i oppose hb 276.
 
06:27:29.110 --> 06:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
as an 11 year old that just started her
 
06:27:31.430 --> 06:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
period the summer before sixth grade i
 
06:27:33.190 --> 06:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
was a bit unprepared when it came to
 
06:27:35.030 --> 06:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
having it in school
 
06:27:37.510 --> 06:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
and one day before lunch i ran to the
 
06:27:39.510 --> 06:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
bathroom and put on a pad from the ones
 
06:27:42.070 --> 06:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
provided in the bathroom i was so
 
06:27:44.150 --> 06:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
embarrassed that i waited until someone
 
06:27:46.230 --> 06:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the stall next to me flushed to open
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
the package because i didn't want anyone
 
06:27:49.910 --> 06:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
to know that i was having a normal
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
bodily function that comes with puberty
 
06:27:54.548 --> 06:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
the period products that were provided
 
06:27:56.230 --> 06:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
helped me throughout middle school and
 
06:27:57.670 --> 06:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
high school when my menstrual cycle
 
06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
caught me off guard i would run to the
 
06:28:01.430 --> 06:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
nurse's office between classes when i
 
06:28:03.670 --> 06:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
forgotten to restock my backpack or ran
 
06:28:05.270 --> 06:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
out during a cycle
 
06:28:07.190 --> 06:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
for someone like me i was taught to be
 
06:28:09.190 --> 06:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
ashamed of my period that having a
 
06:28:11.910 --> 06:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
gigantic red stain on my pants would be
 
06:28:14.150 --> 06:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
embarrassing and that i should try my
 
06:28:15.750 --> 06:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
best to cover that up
 
06:28:17.670 --> 06:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
i am incredibly grateful that my school
 
06:28:19.750 --> 06:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
was able to help me when i was in a bind
 
06:28:21.510 --> 06:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
but for students that have periods that
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
can't afford to buy master products the
 
06:28:25.590 --> 06:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
ones that the school provides are the
 
06:28:28.708 --> 06:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
only opportunity to have basic access
 
06:28:31.030 --> 06:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
removing the requirement from rsa 189
 
06:28:32.788 --> 06:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
colon 16a
 
06:28:34.868 --> 06:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
is not acceptable
 
06:28:36.948 --> 06:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
to deny students
 
06:28:39.510 --> 06:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
access to basic period products because
 
06:28:41.590 --> 06:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
of the cost to the district is not based
 
06:28:43.030 --> 06:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
in reality
 
06:28:44.788 --> 06:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
school districts across the state have
 
06:28:47.510 --> 06:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
budgets upwards of millions of dollars
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
menstrual products are only a fraction
 
06:28:51.750 --> 06:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
of a percent of the budget with that
 
06:28:53.670 --> 06:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
same line of logic school districts
 
06:28:55.350 --> 06:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
should not buy other sanitary products
 
06:28:57.590 --> 06:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
such as toilet paper or soap or paper
 
06:29:00.310 --> 06:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
towels because they cost just as much
 
06:29:02.708 --> 06:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
and are just as necessary minister
 
06:29:04.548 --> 06:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
products should be available to all
 
06:29:07.670 --> 06:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
students who need them no exceptions
 
06:29:12.070 --> 06:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
amending rsa 189 colon 16a from shall to
 
06:29:14.468 --> 06:29:14.478 align:start position:0%
shall make reasonable efforts to
 
06:29:16.150 --> 06:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
give schools a cop-out from providing
 
06:29:17.830 --> 06:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
these products to students
 
06:29:19.910 --> 06:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
if schools do not provide these products
 
06:29:21.670 --> 06:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
to students because they can't find a
 
06:29:24.390 --> 06:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
room in the budget students will suffer
 
06:29:26.070 --> 06:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
some students will not have any access
 
06:29:28.230 --> 06:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
to menstrual products at all causing
 
06:29:30.070 --> 06:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
them to miss school and suffer falling
 
06:29:30.080 --> 06:29:31.030 align:start position:0%
them to miss school and suffer falling
behind

06:29:31.030 --> 06:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
behind
 
06:29:32.390 --> 06:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
others will not be able to focus on
 
06:29:34.150 --> 06:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
their schoolwork because the only thing
 
06:29:36.070 --> 06:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
they can focus on is not stating their
 
06:29:36.080 --> 06:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
they can focus on is not stating their
clothes

06:29:37.110 --> 06:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
clothes
 
06:29:38.548 --> 06:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
every student that menstruates will be
 
06:29:40.468 --> 06:29:40.478 align:start position:0%
put at a disadvantage
 
06:29:42.948 --> 06:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
hb 276 is a violation of the new
 
06:29:44.548 --> 06:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court and the ruling
 
06:29:46.868 --> 06:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
claremont v governor the state supreme
 
06:29:49.030 --> 06:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
court has ruled that education is a
 
06:29:52.468 --> 06:29:52.478 align:start position:0%
fundamental right and you as legislators
 
06:29:54.628 --> 06:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
have the duty to ensure that the public
 
06:29:56.948 --> 06:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
schools achieve their object and provide
 
06:29:59.110 --> 06:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
an education to all its citizens that
 
06:30:01.190 --> 06:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
support united support all public
 
06:30:01.200 --> 06:30:02.230 align:start position:0%
support united support all public
schools

06:30:02.230 --> 06:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:30:04.390 --> 06:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
providing free period products
 
06:30:06.468 --> 06:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
to all who need them is a crucial part
 
06:30:08.868 --> 06:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
of providing an adequate education
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
because it keeps students from missing
 
06:30:12.628 --> 06:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
school and keeps students focused on
 
06:30:15.190 --> 06:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
achieving academic success
 
06:30:18.868 --> 06:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
amending rsa 189 colon 16a will have an
 
06:30:20.788 --> 06:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
immense impact on students across the
 
06:30:23.270 --> 06:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
state and needs to be kept as is as a
 
06:30:25.190 --> 06:30:25.200 align:start position:0%

i needed them people in period poverty
 
06:30:32.788 --> 06:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
rely on schools for their products and
 
06:30:34.468 --> 06:30:34.478 align:start position:0%
are even more grateful

than five thousand dollars worth of
 
06:31:57.830 --> 06:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
menstrual products for a local shelter

06:32:09.868 --> 06:32:09.878 align:start position:0%
nation in which health hygiene and
 
06:32:12.548 --> 06:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
destigmatization are promoted
 
06:32:14.948 --> 06:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
others have paved the way so that we may
 
06:32:17.430 --> 06:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
follow their lead here in new hampshire
 
06:32:19.670 --> 06:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
let me share a story one that repeats
 
06:32:22.230 --> 06:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
itself every day in public schools
 
06:32:24.868 --> 06:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
i was in class as a 15 year old i sat
 
06:32:26.548 --> 06:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
down for a group project and felt my
 
06:32:28.788 --> 06:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
period come on unexpectedly
 
06:32:30.868 --> 06:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
nothing is quite like knowing that your
 
06:32:33.110 --> 06:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
peers will see blood through your pants
 
06:32:34.628 --> 06:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
i was supposed to be discussing
 
06:32:36.548 --> 06:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
questions with my peers but instead i
 
06:32:39.750 --> 06:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
was panicked embarrassing and bleeding i
 
06:32:41.590 --> 06:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
asked the teacher to leave class hoping
 
06:32:43.830 --> 06:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
no one would see the bloodstain i was
 
06:32:45.910 --> 06:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
mortified as i walked awkwardly to my
 
06:32:47.830 --> 06:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
locker all the way across school to get
 
06:32:50.230 --> 06:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
a pat but i was out of pads in my locker
 
06:32:52.390 --> 06:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i panicked once again there are a
 
06:32:54.150 --> 06:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
myriad of reasons i did not go to the
 
06:32:56.628 --> 06:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
nurse they were far away often out of
 
06:32:58.708 --> 06:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
office had many other students to deal
 
06:33:00.548 --> 06:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
with and i was already embarrassed
 
06:33:00.558 --> 06:33:01.750 align:start position:0%
with and i was already embarrassed
enough

06:33:01.750 --> 06:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
enough
 
06:33:03.670 --> 06:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
i made a beeline to the bathroom where i
 
06:33:06.468 --> 06:33:06.478 align:start position:0%
constructed an ineffective pathetic pad
 
06:33:08.390 --> 06:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
out of toilet paper placing it
 
06:33:10.948 --> 06:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
strategically in my underwear the only
 
06:33:13.670 --> 06:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
solace was that every one of my friends
 
06:33:15.510 --> 06:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
had been in this position of desperation
 
06:33:15.520 --> 06:33:16.548 align:start position:0%
had been in this position of desperation
before

06:33:16.548 --> 06:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:33:18.628 --> 06:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
several minutes passed as i cleaned up
 
06:33:20.788 --> 06:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
had been there for me i could have taken
 
06:33:22.628 --> 06:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
much less time and had the comfort of
 
06:33:24.628 --> 06:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
knowing i wouldn't bleed through my
 
06:33:27.190 --> 06:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
pants anymore by the time i got back to
 
06:33:28.948 --> 06:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
class i had missed a significant amount
 
06:33:31.270 --> 06:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
of instruction and material
 
06:33:33.670 --> 06:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
one thing i must make very clear
 
06:33:35.830 --> 06:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
toilet paper is free in schools
 
06:33:37.670 --> 06:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
therefore menstrual products should be
 
06:33:37.680 --> 06:33:38.708 align:start position:0%
therefore menstrual products should be
too

06:33:38.708 --> 06:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:33:40.628 --> 06:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
menstrual products need to be in
 
06:33:42.628 --> 06:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
bathrooms so students can quickly attend
 
06:33:45.030 --> 06:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
to their most basic health and hygiene
 
06:33:45.040 --> 06:33:45.910 align:start position:0%
to their most basic health and hygiene
needs

06:33:45.910 --> 06:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
needs
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
no one expects a student to bring toilet
 
06:33:50.548 --> 06:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
paper into school and no one would make
 
06:33:53.030 --> 06:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
them get some from the nurse so why are
 
06:33:54.868 --> 06:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
we making students bring their own
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
menstrual products in
 
06:33:58.390 --> 06:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
not providing menstrual products is a
 
06:34:00.628 --> 06:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
proven barrier to education those
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
experiencing poverty are even less
 
06:34:04.548 --> 06:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
likely to have access to these products
 
06:34:06.708 --> 06:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
as abby touched on earlier
 
06:34:08.468 --> 06:34:08.478 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we know that
 
06:34:11.190 --> 06:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
education is a fundamental right without
 
06:34:13.030 --> 06:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
menstrual products in schools we are not
 
06:34:15.270 --> 06:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
upholding this truth thank you and i
 
06:34:17.430 --> 06:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to oppose this bill i
 
06:34:20.310 --> 06:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
06:34:25.910 --> 06:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions for fiona
 
06:34:27.430 --> 06:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
not seeing anything very much for
 
06:34:30.230 --> 06:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
testifying today
 
06:34:31.270 --> 06:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:31.280 --> 06:34:32.310 align:start position:0%
thank you
welcome

06:34:32.310 --> 06:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
06:34:45.190 --> 06:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:45.200 --> 06:35:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
me

06:35:00.150 --> 06:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:02.868 --> 06:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
there you go i got myself unneeded um
 
06:35:05.670 --> 06:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
so i i continue seeing a lot of me today
 
06:35:07.350 --> 06:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm representing timothy oregon stratfor
 
06:35:08.868 --> 06:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
county district execs the towns of
 
06:35:10.708 --> 06:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
durham and madbury so i
 
06:35:13.750 --> 06:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill i think um
 
06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
even though i'm uh
 
06:35:17.270 --> 06:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
even though i'm a man and you know even
 
06:35:19.590 --> 06:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
women my age are long past uh
 
06:35:22.150 --> 06:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
menopause i still find this really an
 
06:35:24.230 --> 06:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
offensive bill this is not
 
06:35:25.990 --> 06:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate place to put a
 
06:35:28.548 --> 06:35:28.558 align:start position:0%
little lecture about article 28a this is
 
06:35:28.558 --> 06:35:29.750 align:start position:0%
little lecture about article 28a this is
uh

06:35:29.750 --> 06:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:35:30.948 --> 06:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
several other people who mentioned
 
06:35:33.190 --> 06:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
toilet paper these metro products are as
 
06:35:34.468 --> 06:35:34.478 align:start position:0%
basic as
 
06:35:37.110 --> 06:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
as basically as toilet paper um
 
06:35:38.788 --> 06:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
i will say uh
 
06:35:40.868 --> 06:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
i came to you a couple weeks ago with
 
06:35:42.708 --> 06:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
spells about school lunch programs
 
06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually maybe it just been last week
 
06:35:47.430 --> 06:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
but it seemed like longer ago and um
 
06:35:48.468 --> 06:35:48.478 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit different because
 
06:35:50.070 --> 06:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
there's federal funding sort of stuff
 
06:35:52.310 --> 06:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:35:54.150 --> 06:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
my school district has reached out to me
 
06:35:55.670 --> 06:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the other school did reach out to me
 
06:35:57.350 --> 06:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of my lunch bills nobody's ever
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
reached out to me to tell me to tell
 
06:36:00.468 --> 06:36:00.478 align:start position:0%
kill this menstrual products hygiene
 
06:36:02.628 --> 06:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
back when we passed the original bill
 
06:36:04.548 --> 06:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
that created this um there was support
 
06:36:07.430 --> 06:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
from the school districts so this is uh
 
06:36:08.948 --> 06:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
this is as basic as
 
06:36:10.948 --> 06:36:10.958 align:start position:0%
you know it's like uh
 
06:36:10.958 --> 06:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
you know it's like uh
like

06:36:11.990 --> 06:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:36:13.350 --> 06:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
it'd be as if we passed a bill saying
 
06:36:14.390 --> 06:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
the school district should make
 
06:36:16.230 --> 06:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts to ensure toilet
 
06:36:17.910 --> 06:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
paper is original at all costs in all
 
06:36:20.708 --> 06:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
bathrooms it's every bit as ridiculous
 
06:36:22.390 --> 06:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
and as insulting as that bill would be
 
06:36:24.788 --> 06:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
so i uh
 
06:36:27.030 --> 06:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know want to have state funding i
 
06:36:28.628 --> 06:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
understand the logic behind that except
 
06:36:29.830 --> 06:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
of course the way the budget is
 
06:36:31.430 --> 06:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
constructed that's one of those things
 
06:36:33.510 --> 06:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
that would probably get slashed you know
 
06:36:35.270 --> 06:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
in order just to take a few dollars out
 
06:36:36.948 --> 06:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
of the budget so maybe better just let
 
06:36:38.788 --> 06:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
the school districts
 
06:36:40.390 --> 06:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
pay for it because they're the ones
 
06:36:42.390 --> 06:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are responsible for
 
06:36:44.788 --> 06:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
providing the product so i i
 
06:36:46.548 --> 06:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
i sort of understand the logic of having
 
06:36:48.230 --> 06:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
the state do it but uh
 
06:36:49.350 --> 06:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
one of those little things that would
 
06:36:50.868 --> 06:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
just get whacked out of the budget at
 
06:36:52.628 --> 06:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
budget time so
 
06:36:54.468 --> 06:36:54.478 align:start position:0%
i i say uh
 
06:36:56.150 --> 06:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'd say this this is a good law we
 
06:36:57.270 --> 06:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
should keep it you know we should keep
 
06:36:59.030 --> 06:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
it as it is and you know i'm just really
 
06:36:59.040 --> 06:37:00.468 align:start position:0%
it as it is and you know i'm just really
uh

06:37:00.468 --> 06:37:00.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:37:02.788 --> 06:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
really appalled that they would do it
 
06:37:04.868 --> 06:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
part of it part of it
 
06:37:06.548 --> 06:37:06.558 align:start position:0%
not to impugn anyone's motives or just
 
06:37:08.230 --> 06:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
speculate but certainly i
 
06:37:10.948 --> 06:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
as you can if you heard from other
 
06:37:12.788 --> 06:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
other women who have testified uh you
 
06:37:15.030 --> 06:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
know they do
 
06:37:16.948 --> 06:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
there's like a subtext in there that's
 
06:37:16.958 --> 06:37:17.750 align:start position:0%
there's like a subtext in there that's
that

06:37:17.750 --> 06:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:37:19.750 --> 06:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
they feel like we're playing games with
 
06:37:21.110 --> 06:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
this bill just because it's not viewed
 
06:37:22.788 --> 06:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
as a serious problem not as serious a
 
06:37:24.310 --> 06:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
problem as problems that affected men
 
06:37:26.390 --> 06:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
but for uh women
 
06:37:28.230 --> 06:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
women as you've already heard this is an
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
extremely serious problem this is a very
 
06:37:32.070 --> 06:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
simple inexpensive solution of what can
 
06:37:34.708 --> 06:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
be really a very serious problem that
 
06:37:36.310 --> 06:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
can lead you know that
 
06:37:38.468 --> 06:37:38.478 align:start position:0%
seriously impede women's education so i
 
06:37:38.478 --> 06:37:39.430 align:start position:0%
seriously impede women's education so i
would

06:37:39.430 --> 06:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
they keep they'll keep the bill the way
 
06:37:42.468 --> 06:37:42.478 align:start position:0%
it is so
 
06:37:43.910 --> 06:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
and if you
 
06:37:45.030 --> 06:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
and if you do
 
06:37:46.708 --> 06:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
put in state funding you have to prepare
 
06:37:48.548 --> 06:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
the lobby very hard to keep it in but
 
06:37:50.628 --> 06:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
next time the budget committee like
 
06:37:51.350 --> 06:37:51.360 align:start position:0%

small light into the budget to make it

up so uh i think
 
06:37:57.030 --> 06:37:57.040 align:start position:0%

this amendment just figured we're
 
06:38:00.070 --> 06:38:00.080 align:start position:0%

06:39:18.310 --> 06:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
06:39:20.628 --> 06:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
add some extra words for what
 
06:39:22.628 --> 06:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
representative edwards said when he
 
06:39:25.910 --> 06:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:28.628 --> 06:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
and i want to
 
06:39:31.670 --> 06:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
tell the committee here today that
 
06:39:34.310 --> 06:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
you have to remember
 
06:39:36.948 --> 06:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
that this really this bill really has
 
06:39:39.830 --> 06:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with menstruation or
 
06:39:42.390 --> 06:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
offering products for free
 
06:39:45.110 --> 06:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill is all about
 
06:39:47.590 --> 06:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
is that the legislature must follow the
 
06:39:47.600 --> 06:39:49.990 align:start position:0%
is that the legislature must follow the
constitution

06:39:49.990 --> 06:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:39:53.350 --> 06:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's about our oath as legislators to
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
follow the constitution which does say
 
06:39:58.708 --> 06:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
we should not be
 
06:40:03.030 --> 06:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:06.230 --> 06:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we are doing this with this statute
 
06:40:09.110 --> 06:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
in place we are exercising a power we do
 
06:40:12.230 --> 06:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
not have
 
06:40:15.110 --> 06:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
now i get it that people are coming and
 
06:40:17.190 --> 06:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
saying how you know there's period
 
06:40:17.200 --> 06:40:18.390 align:start position:0%
saying how you know there's period
poverty

06:40:18.390 --> 06:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
06:40:21.190 --> 06:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
and there's you know it's much better if
 
06:40:25.110 --> 06:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
we can offer feminine products for free
 
06:40:28.548 --> 06:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
and all of that i get that i understand
 
06:40:30.548 --> 06:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
it as a woman i understand it when i
 
06:40:33.270 --> 06:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
went to school i had gone through the
 
06:40:33.280 --> 06:40:34.230 align:start position:0%
went to school i had gone through the
same

06:40:34.230 --> 06:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:40:37.270 --> 06:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
problems and issues of worrying about
 
06:40:40.628 --> 06:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
leaking and showing and having a problem
 
06:40:42.628 --> 06:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
of not having enough product with me in
 
06:40:46.230 --> 06:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
my purse i understand it i get it
 
06:40:49.590 --> 06:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
but the way in which this statute stands
 
06:40:51.670 --> 06:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
it is unconstitutional
 
06:40:54.468 --> 06:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
and we as legislators have a duty to
 
06:40:57.670 --> 06:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
repair that we must fix it
 
06:41:00.070 --> 06:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
so if you want to put something in
 
06:41:00.080 --> 06:41:01.430 align:start position:0%
so if you want to put something in
statute

06:41:01.430 --> 06:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:41:04.948 --> 06:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
that uh men you know that that that puts
 
06:41:08.548 --> 06:41:08.558 align:start position:0%
some kind of funding grant through
 
06:41:11.030 --> 06:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
our our finance uh
 
06:41:14.310 --> 06:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee or something fine go and do
 
06:41:14.320 --> 06:41:15.190 align:start position:0%
committee or something fine go and do
that

06:41:15.190 --> 06:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:41:18.070 --> 06:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
but otherwise by pushing this
 
06:41:20.230 --> 06:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
down to the school districts as an
 
06:41:23.990 --> 06:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate it is unconstitutional
 
06:41:26.548 --> 06:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
and we must fix this
 
06:41:31.030 --> 06:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
so um i understand i mean i i get
 
06:41:33.750 --> 06:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a need for mr products
 
06:41:35.590 --> 06:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a need to give it out for
 
06:41:35.600 --> 06:41:37.350 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a need to give it out for
free

06:41:37.350 --> 06:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
free
 
06:41:39.110 --> 06:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you want to compare it
 
06:41:41.830 --> 06:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
to toilet paper or soap or
 
06:41:45.430 --> 06:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
or napkin products whatever
 
06:41:47.590 --> 06:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's something totally different
 
06:41:50.468 --> 06:41:50.478 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand here is that as this
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
statute stands it is unconstitutional it
 
06:41:56.070 --> 06:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
is an unfunded mandate
 
06:41:58.390 --> 06:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
and we need to fix it and that's all i
 
06:42:00.310 --> 06:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
have to say today thank you
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%

on hb 276. i testifying against this
bill

06:42:57.670 --> 06:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:42:57.680 --> 06:42:58.788 align:start position:0%
bill
um

06:42:58.788 --> 06:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:01.590 --> 06:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
before i testify against this bill
 
06:43:04.468 --> 06:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
i'm going to share a little bit on my
 
06:43:05.910 --> 06:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
horrible story
 
06:43:07.670 --> 06:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
i one of them
 
06:43:10.548 --> 06:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
one of the people who started a period
 
06:43:12.708 --> 06:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
not even nine years old
 
06:43:14.628 --> 06:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
and then this bill
 
06:43:16.310 --> 06:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
for me is like
 
06:43:18.230 --> 06:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's gonna make embarrassing for people
 
06:43:20.310 --> 06:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
like especially people from
 
06:43:23.030 --> 06:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
like my background
 
06:43:25.350 --> 06:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
we we don't speak up especially when we
 
06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
have to walk and then ask for a man for
 
06:43:30.868 --> 06:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
female products in our culture we don't
 
06:43:32.070 --> 06:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
do that
 
06:43:34.150 --> 06:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
we barely even like
 
06:43:36.708 --> 06:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
get to speak our mothers because in our
 
06:43:38.390 --> 06:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
own culture this is like something that
 
06:43:40.230 --> 06:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't like to talk about it
 
06:43:42.150 --> 06:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
this is something embarrassing do you
 
06:43:42.160 --> 06:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
this is something embarrassing do you
imagine

06:43:43.430 --> 06:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
06:43:45.830 --> 06:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
girls going to a guy's teachers or
 
06:43:47.910 --> 06:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
someone a male
 
06:43:49.430 --> 06:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
person in the school and ask for the
 
06:43:49.440 --> 06:43:50.310 align:start position:0%
person in the school and ask for the
product

06:43:50.310 --> 06:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
product
 
06:43:52.150 --> 06:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing i
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
i feel so embarrassed to hear someone
 
06:43:56.390 --> 06:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
06:43:58.868 --> 06:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
and saying that we should not be
 
06:44:01.830 --> 06:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
giving products to the girls
 
06:44:04.468 --> 06:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
it's embarrassing for someone not having
 
06:44:06.468 --> 06:44:06.478 align:start position:0%
enough products when they go into school
 
06:44:08.868 --> 06:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
and have an accident we should be so
 
06:44:11.750 --> 06:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
important that girls make sure they have
 
06:44:13.830 --> 06:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
confidence we have to build the
 
06:44:15.990 --> 06:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
confidence and the girls this kind of
 
06:44:17.270 --> 06:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
build is not going to build the
 
06:44:19.670 --> 06:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
confidence in the girl it's going to put
 
06:44:22.070 --> 06:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
the comfort down especially one that has
 
06:44:24.310 --> 06:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
to go and then
 
06:44:25.830 --> 06:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
expo themselves
 
06:44:27.510 --> 06:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
every month when they need extra
 
06:44:29.110 --> 06:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
products because they don't have the
 
06:44:31.350 --> 06:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
product necessary when they have the
 
06:44:31.360 --> 06:44:32.468 align:start position:0%
product necessary when they have the
periods

06:44:32.468 --> 06:44:32.478 align:start position:0%
periods
 
06:44:36.230 --> 06:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
so for for that i will ask the committee
 
06:44:39.750 --> 06:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
to itl this bill
 
06:44:41.350 --> 06:44:41.360 align:start position:0%

06:46:06.948 --> 06:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
06:46:09.750 --> 06:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
from aclu
 
06:46:15.030 --> 06:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:18.310 --> 06:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:20.788 --> 06:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you i really
 
06:46:22.628 --> 06:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
06:46:24.708 --> 06:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
again before you today my name is
 
06:46:25.990 --> 06:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
jeannie herroska i'm the political
 
06:46:28.390 --> 06:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
director for the aclu of new hampshire
 
06:46:31.070 --> 06:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today in opposition to hb
 
06:46:34.548 --> 06:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
276 which endangers student health and
 
06:46:34.558 --> 06:46:35.670 align:start position:0%
276 which endangers student health and
safety

06:46:35.670 --> 06:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
safety
 
06:46:38.390 --> 06:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
it is unsanitary and unsafe to not
 
06:46:40.868 --> 06:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
regularly change tampons or pads and yet
 
06:46:43.670 --> 06:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
too often students will try and make it
 
06:46:48.070 --> 06:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
just make just one tampon last an entire
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
school day because going without means
 
06:46:53.670 --> 06:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
staying home from school or utter public
 
06:46:53.680 --> 06:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
staying home from school or utter public
humiliation

06:46:55.510 --> 06:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
humiliation
 
06:46:57.350 --> 06:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
i've been trying to think all day about
 
06:46:59.430 --> 06:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
how to adequately describe how
 
06:47:01.830 --> 06:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
distracting and embarrassing periods can
 
06:47:04.390 --> 06:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
be when a person doesn't have access to
 
06:47:06.788 --> 06:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
products and it's just it's really hard
 
06:47:08.310 --> 06:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
to describe
 
06:47:10.788 --> 06:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
if you haven't experienced it but i can
 
06:47:12.788 --> 06:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
tell you that for students who do not
 
06:47:14.708 --> 06:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
have access to these products it
 
06:47:17.590 --> 06:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
consumes your every hour
 
06:47:19.270 --> 06:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
you're trying to pay attention to math
 
06:47:20.468 --> 06:47:20.478 align:start position:0%
you're trying to pay attention to
 
06:47:23.270 --> 06:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
something else and it's really hard when
 
06:47:25.350 --> 06:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
the one thing at the forefront of your
 
06:47:25.360 --> 06:47:26.390 align:start position:0%
the one thing at the forefront of your
mind

06:47:26.390 --> 06:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
mind
 
06:47:28.948 --> 06:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
is your period this is something that
 
06:47:28.958 --> 06:47:30.230 align:start position:0%
is your period this is something that
should

06:47:30.230 --> 06:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
should
 
06:47:30.240 --> 06:47:31.430 align:start position:0%
should
impact

06:47:31.430 --> 06:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
impact
 
06:47:34.230 --> 06:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
schools it absolutely impacts a
 
06:47:36.468 --> 06:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
student's education
 
06:47:39.350 --> 06:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
um and i i do want to acknowledge that
 
06:47:40.548 --> 06:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:47:42.628 --> 06:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
does require schools to make quote
 
06:47:45.030 --> 06:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts to ensure that
 
06:47:46.948 --> 06:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
menstrual products are available at no
 
06:47:50.150 --> 06:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
cost to students versus hb 458 which
 
06:47:52.708 --> 06:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
eliminated any obligation for schools to
 
06:47:55.830 --> 06:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
do so however this bill still removes
 
06:47:58.868 --> 06:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
the requirement and risks reviving
 
06:48:02.390 --> 06:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
period poverty in our public schools
 
06:48:04.070 --> 06:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation to be honest is
 
06:48:06.548 --> 06:48:06.558 align:start position:0%
particularly distressing this year of
 
06:48:09.070 --> 06:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
all years families are under
 
06:48:11.430 --> 06:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
unprecedented financial hardship right
 
06:48:13.750 --> 06:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
now because of the pandemic increasing
 
06:48:17.190 --> 06:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
the risk of reviving period poverty if
 
06:48:20.468 --> 06:48:20.478 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed
 
06:48:22.230 --> 06:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
with regard to the pandemic it's also
 
06:48:24.390 --> 06:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
worth noting that a lot of public
 
06:48:26.548 --> 06:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
schools have been virtual either
 
06:48:28.310 --> 06:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
part-time or full-time which certainly
 
06:48:31.350 --> 06:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
has reduced the cost of this legislation
 
06:48:33.510 --> 06:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
given that students are spending less
 
06:48:34.830 --> 06:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
time in
 
06:48:37.590 --> 06:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
schools so if cost is the concern it
 
06:48:40.070 --> 06:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
just seems very bizarre that this is the
 
06:48:42.310 --> 06:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
year that this legislation is brought
 
06:48:42.320 --> 06:48:43.510 align:start position:0%
year that this legislation is brought
forward

06:48:43.510 --> 06:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:48:46.628 --> 06:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
and the sb 142 which was the bill passed
 
06:48:48.468 --> 06:48:48.478 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
06:48:51.350 --> 06:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
was a momentous bill it was such a
 
06:48:53.750 --> 06:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
positive bill for new hampshire
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
we all heard the governor signed it he
 
06:48:58.788 --> 06:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
expressed support for it
 
06:49:02.070 --> 06:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
we should stand behind that bill that
 
06:49:04.628 --> 06:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
bill represented progress for student
 
06:49:07.350 --> 06:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
health for student dignity and for
 
06:49:10.390 --> 06:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
learning i'm urging this committee to
 
06:49:13.670 --> 06:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
stand in support of that bill and to
 
06:49:17.270 --> 06:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
oppose hb 276 just like we previously
 
06:49:20.868 --> 06:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
asked you to oppose hb 458 i'm happy to
 
06:49:22.708 --> 06:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
answer questions i really appreciate
 
06:49:24.708 --> 06:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration this late in
 
06:49:25.750 --> 06:49:25.760 align:start position:0%

06:49:27.990 --> 06:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mresco
 
06:49:33.030 --> 06:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
are there any uh questions for mr rescue
 
06:49:33.040 --> 06:49:34.628 align:start position:0%
are there any uh questions for mr rescue
representative

06:49:34.628 --> 06:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:49:37.430 --> 06:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you uh mr ruska
 
06:49:39.910 --> 06:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
for your time again today
 
06:49:43.030 --> 06:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh the aclu famously defends the
 
06:49:45.830 --> 06:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
constitution famously
 
06:49:47.830 --> 06:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
people's rights uh
 
06:49:50.230 --> 06:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
the first amendment comes to mind
 
06:49:50.240 --> 06:49:51.110 align:start position:0%
the first amendment comes to mind
uh

06:49:51.110 --> 06:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:49:52.628 --> 06:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
could you respond please to
 
06:49:54.868 --> 06:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
representative judy aaron's argument
 
06:49:56.948 --> 06:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
that this is not a health issue which
 
06:49:58.868 --> 06:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
which you and others seem to be blowing
 
06:50:00.390 --> 06:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
on but it's simply a
 
06:50:03.590 --> 06:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue and that sb 142 is
 
06:50:05.990 --> 06:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
clearly unconstitutional
 
06:50:07.510 --> 06:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
could you speak to representative
 
06:50:10.628 --> 06:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
aaron's uh points please
 
06:50:13.910 --> 06:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm happy to i i took no uh when
 
06:50:15.590 --> 06:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
the representative noted that the bill
 
06:50:16.868 --> 06:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with menstrual
 
06:50:19.270 --> 06:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
products because i very much disagree i
 
06:50:20.868 --> 06:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
think this bill has everything to do
 
06:50:22.150 --> 06:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
with access
 
06:50:24.948 --> 06:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh to necessary products uh and so for
 
06:50:27.270 --> 06:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
us that's what this bill is about it is
 
06:50:30.548 --> 06:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
about student health and student safety
 
06:50:32.548 --> 06:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
and and i can just know you know i've
 
06:50:35.030 --> 06:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
been before this this committee and
 
06:50:36.948 --> 06:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
other committees many many times over
 
06:50:39.350 --> 06:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
the past four legislative sessions
 
06:50:40.548 --> 06:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
and i hear
 
06:50:43.190 --> 06:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
28 a thrown around a lot
 
06:50:45.590 --> 06:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
and not very consistently i have to say
 
06:50:46.868 --> 06:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
it's brought up
 
06:50:49.430 --> 06:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
it seems when it's convenient and it's
 
06:50:51.430 --> 06:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
sidelined when it's not
 
06:50:54.390 --> 06:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and so to be frank i i choose to
 
06:50:56.468 --> 06:50:56.478 align:start position:0%
focus on the student health and student
 
06:50:58.628 --> 06:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
safety issues here because
 
06:51:00.310 --> 06:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:51:03.510 --> 06:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
very real that is consistent we should
 
06:51:07.750 --> 06:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
all care about student welfare um and so
 
06:51:10.230 --> 06:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
i i defer to the committee on the 28 a
 
06:51:12.230 --> 06:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
issue i just do have not seen that
 
06:51:14.070 --> 06:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
consistently applied before the
 
06:51:17.430 --> 06:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
legislature i have to be honest
 
06:51:19.750 --> 06:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
06:51:22.628 --> 06:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
any uh further questions
 
06:51:24.230 --> 06:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hints thank you very much

they're heavy and it keeps them from

06:52:45.110 --> 06:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
that her senior year of high school she
 
06:52:48.150 --> 06:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
missed 80 years sorry 80 days of school
 
06:52:51.510 --> 06:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
because of her period um taking away
 
06:52:53.750 --> 06:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
menstrual products for women which are
 
06:52:55.430 --> 06:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
as fundamental i know that it was said
 
06:52:57.430 --> 06:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's not as fundamental as toilet paper
 
06:52:59.510 --> 06:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
and so but it's a bodily function it's
 
06:52:59.520 --> 06:53:00.468 align:start position:0%
and so but it's a bodily function it's
normal

06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
normal
 
06:53:02.868 --> 06:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't feel ashamed in a but
 
06:53:05.110 --> 06:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
the way our society functions is we do
 
06:53:07.590 --> 06:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
feel ashamed as women because of
 
06:53:07.600 --> 06:53:08.948 align:start position:0%
feel ashamed as women because of
menstruation

06:53:08.948 --> 06:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
menstruation
 
06:53:10.708 --> 06:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
which is a normal function it's no
 
06:53:12.948 --> 06:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
offense how we all came to exist in this
 
06:53:14.230 --> 06:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
world without menstruation we wouldn't
 
06:53:15.990 --> 06:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
have con you know conception we wouldn't
 
06:53:17.510 --> 06:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
be here
 
06:53:19.270 --> 06:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
i think that is fundamentally what we
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
have to remember
 
06:53:23.510 --> 06:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
taking away this bill taking away access
 
06:53:26.948 --> 06:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
of of girls in seoul to have free
 
06:53:29.510 --> 06:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
period products um raises the issue of
 
06:53:32.628 --> 06:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
gender equality implies that women are
 
06:53:34.390 --> 06:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know treated less than men that we
 
06:53:36.070 --> 06:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't need to give them the same access
 
06:53:38.628 --> 06:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
to fundamental human supplies as men you
 
06:53:40.310 --> 06:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
know we wouldn't take away men's toilet
 
06:53:42.390 --> 06:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
paper why take away women's period
 
06:53:43.510 --> 06:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
products so
 
06:53:46.070 --> 06:53:46.080 align:start position:0%

06:54:25.030 --> 06:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:27.190 --> 06:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
you mind if you take questions
 
06:54:29.510 --> 06:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely i would love questions
 
06:54:32.628 --> 06:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:36.708 --> 06:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
oh i forgot what i was gonna ask um
 
06:54:38.390 --> 06:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:54:42.468 --> 06:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:44.948 --> 06:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
do you i guess
 
06:54:46.708 --> 06:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
what i keep hearing and i'm wondering if
 
06:54:48.548 --> 06:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
you had input on
 
06:54:50.070 --> 06:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
is um
 
06:54:53.270 --> 06:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
because it takes the mandate away
 
06:54:58.468 --> 06:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:00.390 --> 06:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts
 
06:55:05.030 --> 06:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:07.190 --> 06:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
do you believe that that will then
 
06:55:10.310 --> 06:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
schools will just eliminate um
 
06:55:12.948 --> 06:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
carrying the period private period
 
06:55:12.958 --> 06:55:15.670 align:start position:0%
carrying the period private period
products

06:55:15.670 --> 06:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:18.150 --> 06:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think that's a good
 
06:55:19.670 --> 06:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
question i think wording is very
 
06:55:22.788 --> 06:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
important in bills like this um i think
 
06:55:24.788 --> 06:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
from what i've been hearing throughout
 
06:55:26.868 --> 06:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
the day as i've been stepping in and out
 
06:55:29.350 --> 06:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
of clinic is that school budgets are
 
06:55:31.670 --> 06:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
really tough and they're tight and i
 
06:55:34.708 --> 06:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
think people look for ways to
 
06:55:34.718 --> 06:55:35.750 align:start position:0%
think people look for ways to
to

06:55:35.750 --> 06:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:55:38.150 --> 06:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
be able to achieve budgets in a system
 
06:55:41.510 --> 06:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
that is confronted right the public
 
06:55:42.948 --> 06:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
education system
 
06:55:45.350 --> 06:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
needs constant work and i think if you
 
06:55:47.190 --> 06:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
take out language
 
06:55:49.350 --> 06:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
that allows for the option of supplying
 
06:55:51.510 --> 06:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
them without mandating it
 
06:55:53.750 --> 06:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
then it could be something that goes by
 
06:55:55.750 --> 06:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
the wayside and it's not going to be
 
06:55:58.310 --> 06:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
provided and it's unfair
 
06:56:01.510 --> 06:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
that a product that women need for a
 
06:56:04.468 --> 06:56:04.478 align:start position:0%
natural function of their bodies is not
 
06:56:08.390 --> 06:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:10.948 --> 06:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
06:56:12.548 --> 06:56:12.558 align:start position:0%

thank you very much
 
06:56:31.510 --> 06:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:49.750 --> 06:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:52.468 --> 06:56:52.478 align:start position:0%
are you out there megan
 
06:56:54.788 --> 06:56:54.798 align:start position:0%

my zoom goes out on me um so i apologize
 
06:57:02.390 --> 06:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
for that but thank you mr chair um and
 
06:57:04.070 --> 06:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
06:57:05.910 --> 06:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
my name is megan tuttle i'm president
 
06:57:08.868 --> 06:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
for nea new hampshire um
 
06:57:10.868 --> 06:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
representing about 17 000 educators
 
06:57:12.788 --> 06:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
across the state of new hampshire um i
 
06:57:14.468 --> 06:57:14.478 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of this might sound
 
06:57:15.830 --> 06:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
repetitive from what you've already
 
06:57:17.750 --> 06:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard but i think it does bear repeating
 
06:57:20.230 --> 06:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
um based on what this bill is talking
 
06:57:21.990 --> 06:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
about so last year we know a bill was
 
06:57:23.670 --> 06:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
passed and signed by governor sununu to
 
06:57:25.590 --> 06:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
make available free feminine products
 
06:57:28.070 --> 06:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
feminine hygiene products in all girl
 
06:57:29.830 --> 06:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
and gender neutral bathrooms in middle
 
06:57:30.948 --> 06:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
schools and high schools across new
 
06:57:32.628 --> 06:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire that involved getting the
 
06:57:35.030 --> 06:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
products and involved possibly buying
 
06:57:36.708 --> 06:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
and putting up vending machines or other
 
06:57:37.990 --> 06:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
places for those products to be
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
displayed the reason for this was not
 
06:57:41.430 --> 06:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
because it's something girls want it's
 
06:57:43.190 --> 06:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
something girls need i think we need to
 
06:57:44.468 --> 06:57:44.478 align:start position:0%
be clear that without the original
 
06:57:46.708 --> 06:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
provisions in the law all the female
 
06:57:48.948 --> 06:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
students do become second class citizens
 
06:57:50.548 --> 06:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
it's been shown and we talked about this
 
06:57:52.150 --> 06:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
last year that girls are missing on
 
06:57:54.070 --> 06:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
average some of them 40 days of school a
 
06:57:56.708 --> 06:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
year due to not having access to
 
06:57:58.150 --> 06:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
feminine hygiene products that's over a
 
06:58:00.868 --> 06:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
month of school that's a lot um and if
 
06:58:02.788 --> 06:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
you think about it it's not because they
 
06:58:04.150 --> 06:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
want to miss school they're missing it
 
06:58:05.670 --> 06:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
because they don't have access to these
 
06:58:05.680 --> 06:58:06.628 align:start position:0%
because they don't have access to these
products

06:58:06.628 --> 06:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:58:07.910 --> 06:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's not like the girls want to have
 
06:58:09.590 --> 06:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
their period every month but they do is
 
06:58:11.270 --> 06:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony from people before
 
06:58:13.910 --> 06:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
me it's it's just something that we have
 
06:58:15.430 --> 06:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
feminine hygiene products are considered
 
06:58:16.948 --> 06:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
luxury items so it's not like they can
 
06:58:19.190 --> 06:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
be purchased with the use of snap funds
 
06:58:20.868 --> 06:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to take this back by
 
06:58:22.468 --> 06:58:22.478 align:start position:0%
saying that schools only have to use
 
06:58:24.390 --> 06:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable effort to ensure menstrual
 
06:58:26.468 --> 06:58:26.478 align:start position:0%
hygiene products are available and this
 
06:58:27.990 --> 06:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
is just being called an unfunded mandate
 
06:58:29.190 --> 06:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing that i can see in
 
06:58:30.948 --> 06:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
here that says the state has to pay for
 
06:58:32.788 --> 06:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
it it says that they can the district
 
06:58:34.708 --> 06:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
shall seek or the districts may seek
 
06:58:36.310 --> 06:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but nothing saying the
 
06:58:38.070 --> 06:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
state would have to reimburse them and
 
06:58:40.788 --> 06:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
that's wrong the the the law is already
 
06:58:42.310 --> 06:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
there the districts need to provide this
 
06:58:44.708 --> 06:58:44.718 align:start position:0%
and that's what we need to stick with
 
06:58:46.150 --> 06:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
seeking reimbursement because the
 
06:58:47.670 --> 06:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
district has refused to honor its
 
06:58:49.590 --> 06:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide for the basic
 
06:58:51.590 --> 06:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
needs of half their students is a best
 
06:58:53.990 --> 06:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
and insulting second place trophy female
 
06:58:55.270 --> 06:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
students are missing class time and
 
06:58:56.468 --> 06:58:56.478 align:start position:0%
they're being robbed of the sequel
 
06:58:56.478 --> 06:58:57.590 align:start position:0%
they're being robbed of the sequel
education

06:58:57.590 --> 06:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:58:59.190 --> 06:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's applying toilet paper we hear a lot
 
06:59:00.868 --> 06:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
about this and it sounds silly but it's
 
06:59:02.948 --> 06:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
true that's not considered an unfunded
 
06:59:04.390 --> 06:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
mandate schools have to provide
 
06:59:06.070 --> 06:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
receptacles to put the feminine hydrogen
 
06:59:07.430 --> 06:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
products in so they know that they're
 
06:59:07.440 --> 06:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
products in so they know that they're
needed

06:59:08.390 --> 06:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
needed
 
06:59:10.708 --> 06:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
again it sounds silly but it really is
 
06:59:11.990 --> 06:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
the same principle
 
06:59:13.670 --> 06:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
districts provide meals districts pay
 
06:59:15.430 --> 06:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
for water districts pay for heat they
 
06:59:17.110 --> 06:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
pay for all basic human essential needs
 
06:59:19.590 --> 06:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
except this one and they need to elected
 
06:59:20.948 --> 06:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
leaders far too long have ignored
 
06:59:22.628 --> 06:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
women's issues they've denied them equal
 
06:59:24.310 --> 06:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
access and they've proud that there just
 
06:59:25.990 --> 06:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
isn't money to pay for things basically
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing is females is you're
 
06:59:29.190 --> 06:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
not a priority you're not even close to
 
06:59:30.390 --> 06:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
being one
 
06:59:32.230 --> 06:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
other states passing similar laws we
 
06:59:33.430 --> 06:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
were one of the first in the nation to
 
06:59:35.270 --> 06:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
do this last year and other states took
 
06:59:38.070 --> 06:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
our lead scotland as a country has free
 
06:59:39.430 --> 06:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
feminine hygiene products for their
 
06:59:41.670 --> 06:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
entire country a whole country we always
 
06:59:44.948 --> 06:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
hear about other countries and their
 
06:59:46.788 --> 06:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
studies about education and how they got
 
06:59:48.230 --> 06:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
kids back into school why don't we look
 
06:59:49.990 --> 06:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
at studies about free feminine hygiene
 
06:59:51.510 --> 06:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
products for the entire country instead
 
06:59:53.190 --> 06:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
of just in our state and squabbling over
 
06:59:54.468 --> 06:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
whether districts should have to pay for
 
06:59:55.590 --> 06:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
them or not
 
06:59:55.600 --> 06:59:56.708 align:start position:0%
them or not
um

06:59:56.708 --> 06:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:58.150 --> 06:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is in opposition to
 
06:59:59.670 --> 06:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
this bill we don't want girls missing
 
07:00:01.590 --> 07:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
valuable time in schools because of a
 
07:00:03.030 --> 07:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
equity issue like this and there's no
 
07:00:04.390 --> 07:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
reason to change the law that's already
 
07:00:05.590 --> 07:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
in place
 
07:00:07.830 --> 07:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for hearing the testimony
 
07:00:09.830 --> 07:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm more than willing to take any
 
07:00:11.110 --> 07:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
questions and i will be sending in the
 
07:00:12.948 --> 07:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
written testimony for you
 
07:00:16.150 --> 07:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr
 
07:00:18.788 --> 07:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:21.110 --> 07:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
07:00:24.468 --> 07:00:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:27.750 --> 07:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh next we have someone named debbie
 
07:00:40.548 --> 07:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:47.270 --> 07:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:48.948 --> 07:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
 
07:00:48.958 --> 07:00:50.310 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
yeah

07:00:50.310 --> 07:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:00:52.948 --> 07:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
okay good all right um my name is debbie
 
07:00:55.590 --> 07:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
green i'm a constituent in greenville
 
07:00:57.750 --> 07:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i just have a couple
 
07:01:01.190 --> 07:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
of questions as i am fairly new to
 
07:01:04.390 --> 07:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
politics and i'm getting to understand
 
07:01:05.830 --> 07:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
how things work
 
07:01:07.750 --> 07:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
07:01:09.670 --> 07:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
seems to be suggesting
 
07:01:12.548 --> 07:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
that the school districts need to find a
 
07:01:12.558 --> 07:01:13.430 align:start position:0%
that the school districts need to find a
way

07:01:13.430 --> 07:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
07:01:15.910 --> 07:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
to pay for these products on their own
 
07:01:16.708 --> 07:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
and that
 
07:01:19.590 --> 07:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
may get reimbursement they may not
 
07:01:19.600 --> 07:01:20.788 align:start position:0%
may get reimbursement they may not
and

07:01:20.788 --> 07:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:01:22.788 --> 07:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
so that leads me to believe then that
 
07:01:24.708 --> 07:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
what about the very poor school
 
07:01:27.510 --> 07:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
districts who have a hard time affording
 
07:01:29.750 --> 07:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
what they already have
 
07:01:32.948 --> 07:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
they are not going to be provided for
 
07:01:34.628 --> 07:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
so just please give me some
 
07:01:50.468 --> 07:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:53.350 --> 07:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
i see that represent edwards is still
 
07:01:55.270 --> 07:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
on the pump there maybe he could answer
 
07:01:55.280 --> 07:01:56.070 align:start position:0%
on the pump there maybe he could answer
that

07:01:56.070 --> 07:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:01:57.750 --> 07:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
hold on one minute
 
07:01:57.760 --> 07:02:04.628 align:start position:0%
hold on one minute
okay

07:02:04.628 --> 07:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:07.190 --> 07:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
hey edwards we have someone who has a
 
07:02:08.708 --> 07:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
question on the bill would should be
 
07:02:08.718 --> 07:02:10.310 align:start position:0%
question on the bill would should be
available

07:02:10.310 --> 07:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
available
 
07:02:12.628 --> 07:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
for answers
 
07:02:15.110 --> 07:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
07:02:17.430 --> 07:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay jimmy would you please repeat
 
07:02:19.190 --> 07:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
what your question was
 
07:02:22.788 --> 07:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
oh sure okay so this bill seems to be
 
07:02:24.390 --> 07:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting to me
 
07:02:27.430 --> 07:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be placed upon school
 
07:02:31.110 --> 07:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
districts to pay for these products and
 
07:02:32.628 --> 07:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
then to
 
07:02:35.270 --> 07:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
seek reimbursement or scrounge around
 
07:02:35.280 --> 07:02:36.628 align:start position:0%
seek reimbursement or scrounge around
from

07:02:36.628 --> 07:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:02:38.548 --> 07:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
i think i read other like non-profit
 
07:02:41.110 --> 07:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
organizations who might help donate that
 
07:02:42.390 --> 07:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
07:02:45.030 --> 07:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
and that just makes me wonder then what
 
07:02:47.670 --> 07:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
about the very poor school districts who
 
07:02:49.350 --> 07:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
have a hard time
 
07:02:51.590 --> 07:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
already affording things and teachers
 
07:02:53.110 --> 07:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
have to
 
07:02:54.548 --> 07:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
pay money you know out of their own
 
07:02:56.708 --> 07:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
pocket for some of the supplies does
 
07:02:58.310 --> 07:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
does this mean that
 
07:03:02.150 --> 07:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:04.230 --> 07:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question i i
 
07:03:06.628 --> 07:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
would say that um
 
07:03:08.788 --> 07:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
by and large what you're describing is
 
07:03:11.670 --> 07:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
the law as it currently exists
 
07:03:14.468 --> 07:03:14.478 align:start position:0%
the law as it currently exists directs
 
07:03:17.110 --> 07:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
the schools to come up with the funding
 
07:03:18.390 --> 07:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
to pay for
 
07:03:19.830 --> 07:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
the supplies
 
07:03:22.390 --> 07:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't allow
 
07:03:25.590 --> 07:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
the the school districts to come back
 
07:03:28.708 --> 07:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
to the state to request any funds
 
07:03:29.990 --> 07:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:03:32.628 --> 07:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
the issue here
 
07:03:35.430 --> 07:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
really isn't about the the item that
 
07:03:37.390 --> 07:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it's the
 
07:03:40.070 --> 07:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional prohibition
 
07:03:42.948 --> 07:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
of the state legislature
 
07:03:46.070 --> 07:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
directing action on the part of a local
 
07:03:49.110 --> 07:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
school district without also paying for
 
07:03:51.510 --> 07:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
that action it's it's an easy
 
07:03:53.590 --> 07:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional principle that i think
 
07:03:57.510 --> 07:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
any first-year lawyer could explain
 
07:03:59.830 --> 07:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
i don't remember ever allowing a member
 
07:04:03.030 --> 07:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
of the public to question the
 
07:04:05.270 --> 07:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor of a bill
 
07:04:08.788 --> 07:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
during the hearings like this
 
07:04:10.948 --> 07:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
in this particular situation we usually
 
07:04:13.110 --> 07:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
have people that are technicians from
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
various departments and we've also asked
 
07:04:17.510 --> 07:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
at times when the representatives the
 
07:04:19.910 --> 07:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor bill and this was a
 
07:04:22.788 --> 07:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
question regarding the the bill itself
 
07:04:24.788 --> 07:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
and representative edwards was kind
 
07:04:25.990 --> 07:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
enough to
 
07:04:28.548 --> 07:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
try to help him respond it's not a
 
07:04:30.390 --> 07:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee to respond in that because
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:37.830 --> 07:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
you may go ahead
 
07:04:39.910 --> 07:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chairman i i think i've
 
07:04:43.270 --> 07:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
reached the conclusion of the answer i i
 
07:04:45.430 --> 07:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was adequate to the
 
07:04:46.868 --> 07:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
person who asked
 
07:04:51.190 --> 07:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
i i i did have a question for you before
 
07:04:54.788 --> 07:04:54.798 align:start position:0%

speaker's house or speaker's office
 
07:05:25.110 --> 07:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
relative to what the representative from
 
07:05:27.990 --> 07:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
