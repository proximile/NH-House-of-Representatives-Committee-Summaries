00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh is it 10 almost 10 yes
 
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
10 enough
 
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh first up
 
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
we have house bill 1028 relative the
 
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
form of individual health insurance
 
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.670 align:start position:0%
form of individual health insurance
policies

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
so this is is this the short-term one
 
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to speak for this bill
 
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
okay so uh just to
 
00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
remind everybody about this one this is
 
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think turcotte turcotte was the one he
 
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
yeah introduced and this one has the
 
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
idea that we take these short-term
 
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
policies which we do have one company
 
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
that actually does sell this product
 
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
and is designing to be um
 
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
so uh like in between if you're in
 
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
between jobs or something and if you
 
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
just want a quick policy
 
00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
but it does not have any of the rules of
 
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
what i would call senate bill 711 but
 
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
obviously we now have
 
00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
obamacare or
 
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
affordable care act whichever you want
 
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
to call it
 
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
which this this statute would be in
 
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
total violation of
 
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't it it has
 
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition requirements
 
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.910 align:start position:0%
pre-existing condition requirements
so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
obviously that's not a good idea
 
00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
since you can go into the individual
 
00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.709 align:start position:0%
since you can go into the individual
market

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
is it called the marketplace what's it
 
00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
called marketplace now
 
00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
and get a subsidized plan um but
 
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
obviously if you're
 
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
you don't hit the income brackets i
 
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
guess you
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
you might not get the subsidized but
 
00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure you're not going to want
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
to buy a health insurance plan that that
 
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
is going to make you feel out of medical
 
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
is going to make you feel out of medical
form

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
that have you tell them everything
 
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's wrong with you
 
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
which is a fundamental of a short-term
 
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.110 align:start position:0%
which is a fundamental of a short-term
policy

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
maybe is this a question for the chair
 
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's
 
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
someone has expertise on the issue
 
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
that you have people have a long period
 
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
of unemployment and they'll go on to the
 
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
marketplace healthcare.gov
 
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
and their income is actually so low that
 
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get wouldn't be able to
 
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
get into a subsidized plan and they get
 
00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
shipped out how can that be what's that
 
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
your if your income is too low
 
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
you don't get that plan you get moved
 
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
over to medicaid
 
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
and the problem or they suggest that you
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
get medicaid and then some i've had
 
00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 align:start position:0%
constituents apply for medicaid and they
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
can't get it for some technicality or
 
00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 align:start position:0%
reason so that's why i've thought of
 
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
short-term plans as maybe like a backup
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
backup if things really go south then
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
you're just going off the city it is
 
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
available for that you know you could
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
get it but you
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you the
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
technicality needs to be corrected i
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
mean i don't
 
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i i
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
you have to give us a real life story of
 
00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.750 align:start position:0%
you have to give us a real life story of
how

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid doesn't cover somebody you know
 
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
i've heard of people not filling out the
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
form correctly
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
they're not giving the pay stubs or but
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
if you have no
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
income you have no income
 
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
i mean how could how what technicality
 
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
could you be refused on i well i mean
 
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
when i when i've gone door-to-door doing
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
citizens petitions or campaigning
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
um they'll get you know i i can't even
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
remember the whole litany of excuses
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
people been given why they
 
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
have officially their income is too high
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
because somebody else has income or they
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
live with other people or whatever they
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
can't they can't get medicaid and they
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
can't get
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh obamacare so the only thing they can
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
get is a short-term
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
plan until
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
they get a permanent job that's cut
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
where they're covered that they're
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
at work so there's because of household
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're in a household they could be so
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
so it would be going off topic to get
 
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
into why peop in my opinion why people
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
are disqualified for medicaid but
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's there are thousands and
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of people with
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
no income or very low income who cannot
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
get medicaid
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
yeah when you come up here in the mic
 
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
yeah when you come up here in the mic
thanks

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for the record holly
 
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
stevens director of public policy at
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
nami new hampshire
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
i think the state would be very
 
00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.870 align:start position:0%
i think the state would be very
interested

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
the issues that your constituents
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
have had
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
because with
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
granite advantage which is the medicaid
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
expansion program that we have
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's strictly based on income
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
and if you're below 138
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the federal poverty level you
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
automatically qualify they do not look
 
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
at assets there's no asset test for it
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
and it's based on your individual income
 
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.350 align:start position:0%
and it's based on your individual income
so

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
if you've got a son who is 30 living
 
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.110 align:start position:0%
if you've got a son who is 30 living
with

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
his parents
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
against

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
you know so it wouldn't wouldn't
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
disqualify that person from being able
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
to get medicaid so
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
highly suggest that you reach out to
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
the department maybe henry lipman
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
let him know what you're hearing because
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's extremely concerning if there are
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of people who
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
qualify for medicaid expansion
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
and they're being turned away
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
then we need to do something at the
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
i i just think it's getting off topic
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i for the short term plans i just
 
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.670 align:start position:0%
and i for the short term plans i just
think

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a it's kind of a safety net
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
if they've got nothing else and they
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
just need something to cover them for a
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
certain time
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
well that short term is available for
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
that but what i'm i'm
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
but don't ever think that you want to
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
take it for long term
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
because as soon as you make a claim they
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay i mean there's obviously a market
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
for short term
 
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
and it's it's usually for people who are
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
disabled or out of work or some other
 
00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:51.909 align:start position:0%
disabled or out of work or some other
issue

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
yes tyler you want to tell us who are
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
it occurred to me that the issue that
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
those constituents might have faced
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
would have been before the aca or before
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire did a medicaid expansion
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
because medicaid was limited years ago
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
to people who had who were low income
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
but also had something else think sort
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
of women children that type of thing but
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
with the expansion you did away with it
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
those types of limitations so i think
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
maybe they're sort of thinking
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
historically there was a problem they
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
tried to sign up for medicaid and were
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
unable to i think it's also important to
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
point out that the legislation doesn't
 
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:31.670 align:start position:0%
point out that the legislation doesn't
actually

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
change whether or not we're going to
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
have a market for short-term policies
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
the language was was attempted to make
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
them less short-term but either way i
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
think vote the bill you know you don't
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
need to pass the legislation to continue
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
to have these plans available to people
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
all right so we have
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
and you're here
 
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.070 align:start position:0%
and you're here
okay

uh

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:25.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:57.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:06.150 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
okay i don't have the sheets so we're
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
gonna have to uh she's gonna
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
we can use that
 
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.269 align:start position:0%
we can use that
yeah

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
second representative grayson second
 
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.949 align:start position:0%
second representative grayson second
sure

00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
so the motion is uh in expedient to
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislate all those in favor please
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
next up 1162 relative to requiring
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for vaccinations
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
devices medications authorized for
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
emergency use by the united states food
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
and drug administration
 
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.710 align:start position:0%
and drug administration
1162.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
do we have any evidence that this is
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
actually occurring at all or
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
that well we only had one time this to
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
happen right
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have this as um
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
exp i mean it's interim study six to
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
but i don't have who made the motion
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i uh we'll i'll i'll get the file
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we already we already took
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
care of that one
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
all right and that was
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
moving right along um hb 1245 relative
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
to co-payments for services rendered by
 
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
to co-payments for services rendered by
chiropractor

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.509 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
i think i think we should just study
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
this issue um
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
in a little more
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
everybody feel comfortable with study
 
00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:09.430 align:start position:0%
everybody feel comfortable with study
yeah

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.590 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
mr chair i i mean you and i
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
talked about this and i think we've
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
talked about it among our our caucuses
 
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.590 align:start position:0%
talked about it among our our caucuses
that

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
we understand that
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
this could be a problem for some people
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
but that um
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
our feeling is
 
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.590 align:start position:0%
our feeling is
that

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
it really is a
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
negotiation between the
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
chiropractors and the insurance
 
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.230 align:start position:0%
chiropractors and the insurance
companies

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
is that the way you see it as well yes
 
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
is that the way you see it as well yes
exactly

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
but i mean to me you actually have to
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
shop your insurance company
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
right because it i mean what i found out
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
was when i was talking to the sponsor
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
that anthem it's 40 and harvard is 30.
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
and i think one of our difficulties i
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
think one of the difficulties we um i
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
have identified is that
 
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.790 align:start position:0%
have identified is that
um

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're being
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
um classified as specialists
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
but that it really isn't up to us to
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
determine if they're a specialist or a
 
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
determine if they're a specialist or a
pcp

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
pcp
 
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.389 align:start position:0%
pcp
right

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
is that the way we see it
 
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.310 align:start position:0%
is that the way we see it
um

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of who is determined what they
 
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.590 align:start position:0%
in terms of who is determined what they
are

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
i mean the only
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
there is a case actually now that i
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
that a chiropractor could be a
 
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.629 align:start position:0%
that a chiropractor could be a
naturopath

00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
naturopath
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at you now tyler
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
and a natural path can be a primary okay
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
we because we i think if i wrote the
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
statute correctly i think i said may
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
so that there could be an insurance
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
company that would
 
00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:45.269 align:start position:0%
company that would
treat

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
treat
 
00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
treat
that

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
chiropractor if that chiropractor was a
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
naturopath and was their primary care
 
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.030 align:start position:0%
naturopath and was their primary care
physician

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
physician
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
they could get away with no co-pay but
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
are we legislating that we've already
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
done that we already did that
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
that we made
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
well that was chiropractic that was one
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
of my rare occasions where i was able to
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
what a memory you've got to mr chair um
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
so this was legislated that naturopaths
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
may be
classified

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
classified
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
as a primary as primary care and
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
how did that affect chiropractors so
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
because some chiropractors are natural
 
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.110 align:start position:0%
because some chiropractors are natural
paths

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
paths
 
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.430 align:start position:0%
paths
okay

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
then that
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
should give them more argument with
 
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.269 align:start position:0%
should give them more argument with
their

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:32.790 align:start position:0%
their
well

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
i would say the vast majority are not
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
natural paths but
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
that that is just a little twist to the
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
to the storyline but
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm fine with the normal study
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
yeah representation i think the
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
continuing discussion at this time is
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh ample evidence that we need to
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
continue to study this
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh i also think that that we
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
we owe our constituents
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
some of whom i have heard from who are
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to formulate a
 
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.310 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to formulate a
response

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
to them that they
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
can understand
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
which i don't think i can do that right
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
now so i i think just begs once again
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
for interim study okay and i know we'll
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
do that seriously thank you all right
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
all right so the motion uh
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett second by
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative seconded by
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative terry moves uh
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
interim study any discussion on the
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
question of all those in favor please
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:56.949 align:start position:0%
 
12.45

00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
next up 15 uh relative insurance
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
coverage for pandas
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
um well as it turns out the sunset
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't occur for another two years so
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
particular hurry for us to do this bill
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
and and we're still
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
feeling our way through the the claims
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
you might need to come to a mic i'm
 
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.990 align:start position:0%
you might need to come to a mic i'm
sorry

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct so the claims that
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
are not particularly insightful at the
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
moment because there's not a specific
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
diagnosis code for pandas although we
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
understand there is one that is under
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
development and planned to be
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
implemented so at a future point in time
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
we would be able to use the claims that
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
it attract that the pandas patients much
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
better than we can at the moment
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
um so i'd entertain in in exp motion
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
you want to discuss it some more sure
 
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.350 align:start position:0%
you want to discuss it some more sure
yeah

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
i i just i think
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
really all this bill does is take off a
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
sunset clause that the senate put on
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
after we passed this through our
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
committee last term
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
well maybe it's more than that it's
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
going to be three years three years ago
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
all this bill does if you read it is
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
they had put the sunset clause in to
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
repeal this
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
july 1st of 2024 right so that would
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
have been that's all we're changing here
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
is just taking the repeal off so people
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
who are enjoying the coverage
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
will be able to continue to do that and
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
if we if we take the sunset clubs off
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance it will
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
remove the requirement for insurance
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
companies to provide the coverage so
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's two years from now
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
well agreed but we can't there's been no
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
evidence to suggest that this has
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
increased any premiums or there's been
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
any negative effect to this so i don't
 
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.710 align:start position:0%
any negative effect to this so i don't
um

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why we need to wait
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
well there was some question whether the
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
law was really necessary that that
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
we don't really know if there really was
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
well i'd
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think we were all in agreement there
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
was a problem when we all passed the
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill in the first place well not all of
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
us voted for it okay
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
well it but it did pass and and it's
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
true that that we've certainly um had a
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of testimony that this
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
particular treatment
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
did help
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
a certain population i remember there
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
was some debate about the treatment
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
but it left
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
the decision to be made by the person's
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
specialist or care
 
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.950 align:start position:0%
specialist or care
medical

00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
person not us which is appropriate we
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be making decisions for what
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
treatments should be
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
doctors should be
 
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.350 align:start position:0%
doctors should be
so

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that we argued over this
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
it was very clear that in the bill that
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
it wasn't our decision that it was up to
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
the medical profession to decide
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
what was appropriate so
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
you know my fear on this one is it's
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to slip underneath the radar and
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
disappear and we're going to have a lot
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
of people who are going to be hurt by
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
this when they
 
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.350 align:start position:0%
this when they
the

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide the coverage goes
 
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:34.789 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide the coverage goes
away

00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that the sponsor has
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
already committed to putting this bill
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
in again next year we'll keep putting it
 
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.630 align:start position:0%
in again next year we'll keep putting it
in

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.510 align:start position:0%
in
so

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to slip through the
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
cracks we just want to make sure that
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
when if we decide to uh
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
really repeat the sunset
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
that we have good evidence that the
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
could could we amend the motion to
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
interim study just so that future
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislation would
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
be beyond the record that at least our
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee um feels that this is a um
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
a worthwhile discussion to continue okay
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it's more of a parliamentary
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
inquiry i also agree that the legislate
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
maybe not the legislature but the state
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
needs to do something about this issue
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
because it's important enough to do
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
something about but if we're going to
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
say we want to put it on the record i'm
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if it
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
to actually put it on the record like
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
the house journal wouldn't that be
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
something where you kind of make a
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor or someone just says
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know as a committee we've agreed
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
that something needs to be done about
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
this and then just add that to the house
 
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.350 align:start position:0%
this and then just add that to the house
journal

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
journal
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
well it would be when we put it in the
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
calendar for why we're keeping his
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to make the motion
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
when we take it up for the full
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's well when i said uh we had a
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
bill on hydroelectric dams and i just
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
kept writing this damn bill is necessary
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
because yada yada and then the
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
house clerk took all that language out
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
and nobody laughed
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
if we if we give it an interim study
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
certainly you know that allows the
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
future like
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
future legislation to um look at the
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
file and
 
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.669 align:start position:0%
file and
um

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
consider that we felt that it was worth
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
continuing the discussion you want to do
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
something about it said and i just have
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
i have a feeling that somebody else is
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
probably also going to volunteer to
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
write this because it's
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's something that a lot of members of
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
the committee care about i'm glad to
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
write it i think representative bartlett
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
will win and as rich lambert points out
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm the only legislator who has to when
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
he does his financial disclosure
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
documents that i own a dam
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
and yes it's a damn damn shame that i
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
have to pay twelve hundred dollars a
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
year for
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
licensure fees
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
you should have seen the article this
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
morning about the the durham old mill
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
dam who's in the paper
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
okay all right so all those in favor of
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
interim studies raise your hand one two
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair i also have six to zero itl on
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
this one we already we already see okay
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
yeah unfortunately i told her to just go
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
ahead and put all the ones that was that
 
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.750 align:start position:0%
ahead and put all the ones that was that
day

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i had forgotten that we had actually
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay so my memory is not so perfect
 
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.110 align:start position:0%
okay so my memory is not so perfect
sometimes

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
so i have to write everything down okay
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
so that's already itl what i don't have
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
is who made the motion yeah that'll be
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
in the file
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
i do have something i want to hand out
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
of course this subcommittee is different
 
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
of course this subcommittee is different
yes

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
you took any kind of business course you
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
had to read it
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
everybody who had to read this
 
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:48.630 align:start position:0%
everybody who had to read this
everybody

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
and who wrote this um
 
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.590 align:start position:0%
and who wrote this um
draft

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
and you wrote you wrote this mr chair
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
this was handed to me by the bankers
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
association by the new hampshire bankers
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
association okay this is new hampshire
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
bankers association hand this to me
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
it goes on probably says more of the
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
same maybe
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
because why don't you just come in and
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
introduce you know what you where we're
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
reading here just so people know what
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
there's nothing better to do on new
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you mr chair um i did
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
not write this um i just shared it as i
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
thought it might be helpful um this was
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
information that was shared from folks
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
at the uniform law commission so um i
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
did not see that the obviously it's only
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
got a page one there i can go back and
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
see if there's a second they're
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
additional it could be who knows how
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
many pages there could be but the key
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
element is the first couple of
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
paragraphs there yes i just wanted to
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
share that in case it was a helpful
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
resource for you all i know it's a very
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
dense issue so this was their draft you
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
can see when they dated it um for last
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
year is just for why they believe that
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
states should adopt
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
um chapter 12 to the ucc and i mean when
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
they wrote this i'm assuming they
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
intended states to adopt it once it's
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
been finalized which isn't yet although
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
close so just providing it as a resource
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
so i can't take credit but i will try to
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
find additional pages
 
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.390 align:start position:0%
find additional pages
yes

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you for taking my question
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's not actually a question it's a
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
statement um i have here the uh um
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
2022-1 from the governor
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh establishing the commission on
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies and digital assets
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the report on this is due out august
 
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.510 align:start position:0%
and the report on this is due out august
8th

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
8th
 
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.470 align:start position:0%
8th
so

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that we should
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
just put this aside until we hear from
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
um which is sounds like it's going to be
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
a very good group of people who all have
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge with the subject
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
and see what he has to suggest
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chris
 
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.789 align:start position:0%
thank you chris
um

00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay so here here's the situation
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
and and yes if you want to represent
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
foreign is that going to be released
 
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.110 align:start position:0%
foreign is that going to be released
obviously

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
well then
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
interim study will allow us to wait to
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
get that report
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
and come revisit this that would be my
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion i could support interim study
 
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.710 align:start position:0%
suggestion i could support interim study
okay

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.149 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
here's here's where i stand on this bill
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
enough times to have have reviewed and
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
the whole point of ucc legislation is
 
00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:04.310 align:start position:0%
the whole point of ucc legislation is
that

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
everybody passes it every state passes
 
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.310 align:start position:0%
everybody passes it every state passes
it

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
i have to be
 
00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:14.950 align:start position:0%
i have to be
honest

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
honest
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
and admit
 
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.110 align:start position:0%
and admit
that

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
in normal course of events in normal
 
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.870 align:start position:0%
in normal course of events in normal
sequences

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
sequences
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
let's wait another year
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
let's wait to next year
 
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
let's wait to next year
and

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
we know we'll have the official language
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
and everything is
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
all the eyes are dotted and the t's are
 
00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:41.669 align:start position:0%
all the eyes are dotted and the t's are
crossed

00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
but having knowing that
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
and knowing that we have a timing
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
sequence here in terms of
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would still need to be go to
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:55.350 align:start position:0%
the senate
and

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
if anybody else thinks this is premature
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
and not the right time to pass it
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm balancing that off with
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
that i was never
 
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.549 align:start position:0%
that i was never
overly

00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
overly
 
00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:15.590 align:start position:0%
overly
happy

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
happy
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
with the fact that we have absolutely no
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority no guidelines we
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
got nothing
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.389 align:start position:0%
 
blockchain

00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
blockchain
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.750 align:start position:0%

hampshire

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
what this ucc bill does
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
is creates
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
the guidelines
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
for anybody who is actually harmed
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
by crypto technology
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
if somebody is harmed by it
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
they would use
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
to pursue
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit pursue trying to get their
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
money back
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
so if you democrats and i'm pointing to
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
you now
 
00:29:05.919 --> 00:29:06.789 align:start position:0%
you now
think

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
that it's not worth
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
trying to put something in
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
in effect right away
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
to protect consumers
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
protect people
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
and you would much rather just sit on it
 
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
for another year because if we don't do
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
it that means this won't be in law until
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
year and two months from now
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we should only be commerce and not
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs and not give the tools
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
to help consumers if they are harmed by
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
this technology
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
and lord notice i had nightmares last
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
night thinking about all those little
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
numbers and blocking and i just i had
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
kept waking up thinking that i
 
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.669 align:start position:0%
kept waking up thinking that i
that

00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
how did they how does this technology
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
work i just it's beyond me it's very
 
00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:56.149 align:start position:0%
work i just it's beyond me it's very
scary

00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
scary
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
and if i know that we have an
 
00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:00.549 align:start position:0%
and if i know that we have an
opportunity

00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
to be the first state to say
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's here
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
but we want to make sure our
 
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.789 align:start position:0%
but we want to make sure our
constituents

00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
have the tools that have the protections
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
to ensure that these transactions are
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
i have another problem with the bill
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
and that's in the first section which is
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
the which was part of the original bill
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh about the um
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
exemption for securities
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
saying that it would not be treated as a
 
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.470 align:start position:0%
saying that it would not be treated as a
security

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
and it's it's about the secretary of
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
state's fee which is a hundred dollars
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
per filing
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
in wyoming it's a thousand dollars per f
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
per filing and i'm wondering why ours is
 
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:48.789 align:start position:0%
per filing and i'm wondering why ours is
so

00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
low and whether or not that's going to
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
be enough
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost of this
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
well since the secretary of state
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
is not actually enforcing or doing
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
anything and all they're doing is being
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
agent you could say well why don't we do
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
it like a non-profit and only be fifty
 
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.389 align:start position:0%
it like a non-profit and only be fifty
dollars

00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
but a hundred dollars is a standard
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
transaction we have for businesses
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
and all it is is that they are recording
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
that it exists
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
and so therefore that again
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
that is a key element of the protection
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
that we're not getting you anything
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
other than
 
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.430 align:start position:0%
other than
uh

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of the person who's having a
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
lawsuit if there's is that
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
i was sold a product that was not
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
properly registered
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
so whether it's a hundred dollar or a
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we certainly don't want
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
to do a thousand dollars if we're not
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
going to actually do any enforcement
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
that would be an unfair use of fees
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
so are you saying there won't be any
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement the enforcement no that is
 
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.950 align:start position:0%
enforcement the enforcement no that is
correct

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah excuse me yes that is correct
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of this legislation is
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
private right of action that is already
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
been stated that's already been done by
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
this committee we are not expecting
 
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.630 align:start position:0%
this committee we are not expecting
departments

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
because remember this is a commodity
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're not expecting the department don't
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
we usually ask for enforcement when we
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
when we make a law
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
what's the point
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
like i said
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
is that under our consumer protection
 
00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:20.070 align:start position:0%
is that under our consumer protection
act

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
we have created the private right of
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
action triple damages
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
and that can be anything
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
when the consumer has been harmed
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
my feeling still is that this is a
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous industry i think that it's
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
rife with all kinds of fraudsters and i
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
personally don't think new hampshire
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
should be first in the nation to put out
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
the welcome met no it's not the welcome
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
mat this is absolutely not the welcome
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
mat at all this is saying is if you're
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
going to do do this activity
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
there's an expectation
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
that you are going to do it
 
00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:01.509 align:start position:0%
that you are going to do it
appropriately

00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
and this is the same appropriateness
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
that everyone else in the country is
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
eventually going to pass
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
representative mccleary
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
the way i read this is this is does not
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily commit
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
commit us to anything because this is
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
simply saying that should we decide to
 
00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:20.149 align:start position:0%
simply saying that should we decide to
proceed

00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have the
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
certain regulations in effect so ground
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
rules i i don't have a problem with this
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
because it is not
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
thin a it's not done thank you all right
 
00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:33.909 align:start position:0%
thin a it's not done thank you all right
okay

00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
so i was just going to read into the
 
00:33:42.399 --> 00:33:43.590 align:start position:0%
so i was just going to read into the
record

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
some of the sentences in this
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation the last sentence of
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
first paragraph a state should adopt the
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
amendments to facilitate modern
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
commercial transactions involving these
 
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.909 align:start position:0%
commercial transactions involving these
technologies

00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
and avoid obstacles and lack of clarity
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
inhibiting the transactions or
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
increasing their costs so the ucc the
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
universal uh
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
law commission is recommending that
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
states adopt this no of course it's
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
draft but
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
do we want to be part of the pack and
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
not have an advantage or do we want to
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
be a step ahead
 
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.829 align:start position:0%
be a step ahead
on

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
on
this

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
technology it's this technology is going
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
to change it's currently changing the
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
world this is
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is not beanie babies this is the
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
and so trying to paint it with uh
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know the brush of criminal activity
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
every technology is amoral
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
you can use a knife to cut a stake you
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
can use a knife to stab someone you can
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
use a car
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
to get groceries or to get away from a
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
bank robbery
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
same with the internet so trying to
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
paint a technology with with morality
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing with nuclear weapons
 
00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:54.550 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing with nuclear weapons
right

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
or nuclear technology this is a
 
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.910 align:start position:0%
or nuclear technology this is a
technology

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's earth
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
changing it's societal changing and i
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire does want to be out
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
in front of this
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
our industry our banking industry our
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory department
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
will have
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
a head start on every other state by
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
getting up to speed on this
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
change that is coming so
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of like being
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
forward-looking or being stuck in the
 
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.550 align:start position:0%
forward-looking or being stuck in the
past

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative anderson's next it's just
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
a point of information uh in criminal
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
law and civil law indefinite sorry in
 
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.829 align:start position:0%
law and civil law indefinite sorry in
definitions

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
voice isn't too loud today in
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
definitions and whatnot um
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
the way things have always been since
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
colonial times is every issue or every
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
question in a lawsuit or something like
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
that is first handled under the common
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
law which is how the courts interpret
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
natural law so if you're wronged or
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
harmed in such a way you cur you have a
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
cause of action
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature comes up with a
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
law like the criminal code only took
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
effect in 1973 before that we were under
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
common law you know common law murder
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
common law rape common law arson that
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
kind of thing so
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
there in my opinion that there is
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
currently a
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
process and it would just be going to
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
the superior court to actually sue
 
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.230 align:start position:0%
the superior court to actually sue
someone

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
if somebody had a cause of action
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
do we want to
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
for members the actual question i think
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
is do we want to just let the courts
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
continue to run with this or do we want
 
00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:23.109 align:start position:0%
continue to run with this or do we want
to

00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
kind of step in and have a say
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
so i think that's what it kind of comes
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
down to
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative burrows
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
thanks and this is really just an open
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
question which is you
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair you you talked about how
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
complex this is and in
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is new to many of us so
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm grappling with is this
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
above our crate our pay grade in terms
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
of the complexity and the understanding
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
of it to leave this to a commission that
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
might include people who are expert
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
in this field and i'd be curious to know
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
your take on that
 
00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
your take on that
um

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what the purpose of the
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
commission was
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
and what the governor had in mind
 
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.310 align:start position:0%
and what the governor had in mind
um

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
i i i would tell the governor that stole
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
his not made in russia but
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop him from doing what he
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
so i mean i i i've read that read the
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
general purpose was just just a you know
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
the type of study
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
but that did did it actually say
 
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.310 align:start position:0%
but that did did it actually say
um

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
that you know in terms of you know what
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation or what's going
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
forward there's no doubt in my mind that
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
every member of that commission would
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
first thing you do
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
so if you want to
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
move the process along
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
then you pass the bill if you want to
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
delay it another year
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
i mean yes that commission comes out but
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean they're doing anything
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
until it comes to the legislature which
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
won't happen until next january
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
so we would not have anything in effect
 
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.589 align:start position:0%
so we would not have anything in effect
until

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:04.630 align:start position:0%
until
july

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
july
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thanks mr chair
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
so we know there's another amendment
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to come along correct we're
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
not going to deal with that today
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
so what we're voting on is not really
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
what's going to be final anyway it's in
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the day this is going to be
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
at the senate you know a month from now
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
the senate will then have that decision
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
to make uh to
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
take up and clean up the
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
statute to clean up the statute well
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the problem we have is we don't really
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
know exactly what we got with this red
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
line version
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
because it seemed to be taking the notes
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
and rolling it in and just commenting on
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
it so
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
we need tom conley
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
and tom conley is in santa domingo and
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
drinking margaritas so we can't do much
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
about that right now so my feeling is
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
that i just i hate to lose this
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to you know get in front
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
on something as important as something
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
that i am having yes trouble
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding and the sooner we get
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
something going on the books the sooner
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
they will all understand what the heck
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
is going on here with this technology
 
00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.030 align:start position:0%
is going on here with this technology
but

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
the whole idea is why would you delay
 
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.230 align:start position:0%
the whole idea is why would you delay
guidelines

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
if you know this is where the where the
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
nation's going
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
because we don't usually put stuff on
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
the books that i grant you that
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to be what's going to
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
be put there we are the last new england
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
state to pass the marijuana legislation
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
we are plenty of times we're not the
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
last but there are times we've been the
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
first well we certainly haven't been the
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
first on cannabis but i don't think
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
that's part of this discussion okay well
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
how about how about the lottery we were
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
we were the first with the lottery so
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know there are times you can be the
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
first certainly grown
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody has a problem with the
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
lottery nobody has a problem with the
 
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
lottery nobody has a problem with the
lottery

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
oh okay a lot of people think we should
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
get rid of it let's not say that well
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
you get rid of people think we should
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
get rid of a lot of water that you're
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
you're obs um
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm boy i'm using i'm losing the
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
word um at any rate let's go back to the
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
amendment okay um
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i have a problem with
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
our passing something we know is not
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh as far as i can read into it
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
it is not that much different than what
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
we have in this amendment
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that it would uh the
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
if there are and there is it seems to be
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
some more reference references and
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
reference points
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
that is uh certainly appropriate for tom
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
conley to have it fixed and have us
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
recommend to the senate to go forward
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
with the bill could could we but i hate
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
to just say just put the brakes on it
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
right now and say let's wait another
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
year could we ask christy merrill to
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
come up and talk about the possibility
 
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.349 align:start position:0%
come up and talk about the possibility
of

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
another amendment
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
we could certainly ask chrissy how what
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
because this this draft that we were
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
just provided with
 
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.390 align:start position:0%
just provided with
doesn't

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
address the changes that have happened
 
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
address the changes that have happened
since

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
december 31st
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
so why don't you tell us chrissy what
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
that really happened
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative christy merrill
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%

share a um
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
an amendment from the latest version
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
which i understand is incorporated in
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment before you all today and
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
there is a committee meeting i believe
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
by the drafting
 
00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.990 align:start position:0%
by the drafting
committee

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
next week i want to say march 7th and
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
8th and i apologize i'm going by memory
 
00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:47.109 align:start position:0%
8th and i apologize i'm going by memory
um

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
the committee that is going to be
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
looking at it it's the drafting
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
commission it's one of the drafting
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
commissions that's been focused on this
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
article 12.
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is they are going to
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
be meeting march 7th and 8th
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i believe they may have an april
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
maid um i believe they may have an april
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
meeting at some point and this is the
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire bankers association no
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
this is this is the uniform law
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
commission okay and so i i'm relaying
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
information that i've been told by by
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
one of their members um so they'll have
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
the the meeting next week where they
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
will look at another draft amendment um
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
and that because i tried to get a sense
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
you know is there more significant more
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
revisions coming and it's really hard to
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
say because you know similar to your
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
process you may have an amendment that's
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
good to go and everyone decides they're
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
fine or you may look at it and say you
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
know so they can't
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
they can't tell me with any great
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
certainty yes this is done i think they
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
feel like it's close
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
but i don't know what that means exactly
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i understand that they've got the
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
meeting in march there may be a meeting
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
in april and i my understanding is that
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like they have an annual
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
meeting in
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
june i believe where they where i would
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
suspect a final version would come out
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
so that's just my interpretation of what
 
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
so that's just my interpretation of what
i

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
understand to know that's happening
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
and if i can get the find the email i'll
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
pin that down
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
represent has a question
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
is it true that this is likely to
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
continuously be refined in the coming
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
years that
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
because this technology is rapidly
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
evolving and you know the the legal and
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh regulatory issues around it are
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
likely to continue to evolve to keep up
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
with the pace of the technology
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
that this is an ongoing process what
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that when you say
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing process are you referring to the
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission or do you mean
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
just overall general regulatory in the
 
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.270 align:start position:0%
just overall general regulatory in the
space

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
i guess it could apply to both but the
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
language that we have before us will
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
continue to evolve
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
possibly in perpetuity as uh the
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
technology that it tries to advise on
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
also continues to evolve i can't answer
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm not sure i don't know how their
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
process works i'm assuming if things
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
were would continue to emerge that they
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
would continue to evolve that i think
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's a fair assumption but i just
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
don't know and haven't had those
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
conversations my my understanding is
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
that they expect adoption of an
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.839 --> 00:44:33.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
oh john yeah you're sorry um i actually
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
can probably add to that because the
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
draft that we got the 102 page document
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
deals with a lot of sections other than
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
the new section 12. right there are a
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
lot of other
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
changes made to the code that are in
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
this full document right so it is they
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're looking at it all the time i'm
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
sure and updating it exactly
 
00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:59.349 align:start position:0%
sure and updating it exactly
exactly

00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
so i mean i have to agree that normally
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
we would wait but in this case i think
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh this is a a rare opportunity for us
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
to do something and have something go
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
forward and and if it becomes obvious
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
that that that there's more changes are
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
going to made and when this commission
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
comes back
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
then the governor can veto it
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
and we can we'll start start over but i
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
think i think
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great start and an important
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
all right so uh in terms thank you chris
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay so um i guess this is the business
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we have some changes
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
here who's here and who's not here
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
okay i thought you were stepping in for
abel

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
abel
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
beat two people
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
not easily
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
um so said
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
okay and all those opposed
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
one two three six to three
 
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.230 align:start position:0%
one two three six to three
okay

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
what was the
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes oh i just want to make a quick
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
point of information on the ucc um this
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
has been an ongoing it's literally a
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
convention of the states
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's in chicago every year
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
we've had over 100 of them and so
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
there's another committee that's always
 
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.069 align:start position:0%
there's another committee that's always
uh

00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
raising concerns and terrors about what
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
would happen in a convention of states
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
we've had almost 200 of these and we've
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
had over 200 state constitutional
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
conventions on top of that they're
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
different but
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
this this has been working just fine for
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
as long as we've been doing this and it
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
hasn't resulted in all the doom and
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
gloom that some people that that other
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
committee which i won't mention has been
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
saying so if convention of states comes
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
up again next session this is already
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
are you talking about our constitutional
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
requirement over 10 years to put to the
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
voters whether we should have a
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention so there's a
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
state constitutional convention
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
there have been over 200 of those around
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
the the country uh i'm talking about our
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
constitution requires
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
that that's the state constitutional
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
convention okay so that's how we can get
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
a raise you know they did yeah if it
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
ever hasn't passed since 1884
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
but the convention of the states is
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's not true the last constant
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention new hampshire
 
00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.430 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention new hampshire
had

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
was actually in the 70s
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
and i know this only because al jacobson
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
who was still around when i was get
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
elected he was he was a president of the
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh of the constitutional convention and
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember there was a
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
couple of articles that actually did
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
get passed through but
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
um but the state actually the voters did
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
actually have us go forward with a
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention in in more
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
modern times if i recall that but didn't
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
they expand the bill of rights a bit
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
because i saw a couple of days
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
i have to admit i don't remember what
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
but a convention of the states is
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
you know all 50 state legislatures we
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
send a delegate to orlando or something
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
no this is i'm talking about new
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire now but i'm i'm saying on the
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
federal one yeah the ucc what i'm saying
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
is under article 5 of the us
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
constitution all 50 states each one
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
sends one delegate and then they discuss
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
the details and send it back to the
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%

you know but i can tell you so i mean i
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:24.790 --> 03:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:22.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:16:22.469 --> 03:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:16:24.630 --> 03:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh being
 
03:16:28.229 --> 03:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
115 we'll get started here
 
03:16:28.239 --> 03:16:29.429 align:start position:0%
115 we'll get started here
uh

03:16:29.429 --> 03:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
with the exact session we start out with
 
03:16:36.630 --> 03:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:45.190 --> 03:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.950 --> 03:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
so the schedule
 
03:16:46.960 --> 03:16:47.670 align:start position:0%
so the schedule
we

03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:16:50.070 --> 03:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
do you want to go by this one or i i
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
usually do numeric but
 
03:16:52.319 --> 03:16:53.429 align:start position:0%
usually do numeric but
um

03:16:53.429 --> 03:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:55.110 --> 03:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
i guess the bills were all over the
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
place on this one but
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
originally

03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
originally
 
03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
i sent a or would carry carrie sent out
 
03:17:07.269 --> 03:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
i have no idea where everything is on
 
03:17:13.910 --> 03:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay yep 15.95
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay house bill 15
 
03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:26.630 align:start position:0%
okay house bill 15
95

03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
95
 
03:17:28.630 --> 03:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
food trucks
 
03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
food trucks
okay

03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:33.269 --> 03:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
all right you know i'm sorry who would
 
03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
like to make the motion on the interim
 
03:17:34.479 --> 03:17:36.389 align:start position:0%
like to make the motion on the interim
study

03:17:36.389 --> 03:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:17:39.190 --> 03:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
i had you making the motion okay perfect
 
03:17:41.830 --> 03:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
all right i move interim studies second
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
the fundamental problem we have with the
 
03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
food trucks is
 
03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:52.550 align:start position:0%
food trucks is
that

03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
even the sponsor on the day the bill was
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
introduced to the committee
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
came in with an amendment to have the
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
town the cities who still regulate food
 
03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:03.590 align:start position:0%
town the cities who still regulate food
trucks

03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
trucks
 
03:18:06.070 --> 03:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
to um have some control over the
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
licensure of the trucks which defeats
 
03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of the bill
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know if you're going to if we're
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to have the state trump
 
03:18:15.910 --> 03:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
these cities then
 
03:18:18.550 --> 03:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know how you know then say um but we
 
03:18:20.630 --> 03:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
have this but we have that but
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
so the simple solution today is for us
 
03:18:25.990 --> 03:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
to study this bill and see if there's
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
some way we can make that work but that
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
cannot happen in the short period of
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
time we have
 
03:18:34.630 --> 03:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
so motion is interim study any questions
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
on the motion
 
03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
the question of the clerk uh substitutes
 
03:18:41.830 --> 03:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
on the democrat side could we just
 
03:18:43.269 --> 03:18:43.279 align:start position:0%

03:18:45.190 --> 03:18:45.200 align:start position:0%

okay

03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
motion's clear clerk will call the role

the sponsor's request was for chili dogs
 
03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:31.190 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's request was for chili dogs
and

03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
we have found that it is possible
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
that he can have his chili dog if the
 
03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
push cart vendor
 
03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
buys those pre-made little chili
 
03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:44.960 align:start position:0%

jenny moore makes them they're they're
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
single serving things so as long as
 
03:20:52.389 --> 03:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
they're in their single serving

representative mccleary yes
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative hunts yes 18 to zero okay
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
now the pending motion is ought to pass
 
03:27:08.790 --> 03:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
as amended from representative ammon
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the motion of
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
octopass as amended representative
 
03:27:21.190 --> 03:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you mr chair
 
03:27:26.550 --> 03:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
um uh although i do i did support the
 
03:27:29.349 --> 03:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
amendment i am not in support of the
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill as it stands amended because i
 
03:27:32.160 --> 03:27:32.950 align:start position:0%
bill as it stands amended because i
think

03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons one is that i
 
03:27:36.630 --> 03:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
think it would be a good idea for us to
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
wait until we get the results of the
 
03:27:41.429 --> 03:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
governor's commission which will be
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
coming in on august 8th
 
03:27:47.110 --> 03:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think also that
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
this is not necessarily a place where
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire wants to be first in the
 
03:27:51.279 --> 03:27:52.630 align:start position:0%
new hampshire wants to be first in the
nation

03:27:52.630 --> 03:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
nation
 
03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
i think it's a very risky industry
 
03:27:56.790 --> 03:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:27:58.389 --> 03:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
i do agree with the first part of the
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
bill that um
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know if we're
 
03:28:03.750 --> 03:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with cryptocurrencies
 
03:28:08.550 --> 03:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
exempting them from the securities law
 
03:28:13.110 --> 03:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
is fine but i don't agree necessarily
 
03:28:15.990 --> 03:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
that we want to put ourselves out
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
as first in the nation to open ourselves
 
03:28:20.630 --> 03:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
up to this industry so i have to stand
 
03:28:22.389 --> 03:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
on my principles on this
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:30.630 --> 03:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
anybody else like to speak on the
 
03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
octopus as amended representative
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
abramson uh yeah it's just a quick point
 
03:28:34.960 --> 03:28:36.150 align:start position:0%
abramson uh yeah it's just a quick point
uh

03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
or two quick points one is it
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
it i didn't view this as a security i
 
03:28:42.550 --> 03:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
viewed this as more of a key so it's
 
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
rather than investing or putting your
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
money in a bank or a mutual fund it'd be
 
03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
more like likening to a key for a safe
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
deposit box
 
03:28:52.229 --> 03:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
um so it's not that you're putting money
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
into somebody else's hands for them to
 
03:28:55.190 --> 03:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
go out and invest or loan to other
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
people so it didn't do it as a security
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
i viewed this as
 
03:28:58.560 --> 03:28:59.910 align:start position:0%
i viewed this as
um

03:28:59.910 --> 03:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:02.229 --> 03:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
creating a clear path after the fact not
 
03:29:05.110 --> 03:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
to deal with the sick the the you know
 
03:29:07.030 --> 03:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
the cryptocurrency or the bitcoin itself
 
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
but to deal with if there are
 
03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
allegations of fraud or some other
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
activity to enable the courts to to go
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
do this and and i think there were some
 
03:29:17.190 --> 03:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
very bright people in the ucc who went
 
03:29:19.590 --> 03:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
over all these issues already and i'm
 
03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
certainly expect
 
03:29:25.349 --> 03:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:25.359 --> 03:29:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:29:27.910 --> 03:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not radical
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
legislation this is pretty middle of the
 
03:29:34.389 --> 03:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
road legislation
 
03:29:34.399 --> 03:29:35.510 align:start position:0%
road legislation
and

03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
as we get ahead here a few years looking
 
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
back on this moment i think
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see that new hampshire's making
 
03:29:43.830 --> 03:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the right
 
03:29:43.840 --> 03:29:44.790 align:start position:0%
the right
decision

03:29:44.790 --> 03:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
at this point in time thank you
 
03:29:49.990 --> 03:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion
 
03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
about the pastors amended yes
 
03:29:53.670 --> 03:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
 
03:29:56.229 --> 03:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
chair um i have to say that
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
i have been on the fence on this one
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
um while
 
03:30:03.510 --> 03:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is always used for
 
03:30:06.399 --> 03:30:09.190 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is always used for
transparent

03:30:09.190 --> 03:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:09.200 --> 03:30:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
reasons

03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
npr had an article this morning on
 
03:30:17.830 --> 03:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
how the russian oligarchs are trying to
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
change their rubles that are worth very
 
03:30:22.870 --> 03:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
little right now into
 
03:30:22.880 --> 03:30:25.269 align:start position:0%
little right now into
cryptocurrency

03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
i am going to
 
03:30:29.670 --> 03:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
i am going to support the otpa because i
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
do feel that there are some guardrails
 
03:30:34.229 --> 03:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
on this it does not mean we have to go
 
03:30:34.239 --> 03:30:36.229 align:start position:0%
on this it does not mean we have to go
forward

03:30:36.229 --> 03:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:30:38.790 --> 03:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
with the cryptocurrency in new hampshire
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
though i do recognize
 
03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
it is being used in new hampshire now
 
03:30:50.309 --> 03:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
therefore i will support the otpa
 
03:30:56.830 --> 03:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.840 --> 03:30:58.389 align:start position:0%
 
representation

03:30:58.389 --> 03:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
representation
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that sentiment um
 
03:31:01.990 --> 03:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
again i mentioned earlier that any
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
technology can be used for good and it
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
can also be used for bad purposes so a
 
03:31:08.469 --> 03:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
counterpoint to the russian oligarchs
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
using it if you go on the government of
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
ukraine's official twitter page
 
03:31:15.429 --> 03:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
and you scroll down a few tweets you'll
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
see that they're soliciting bitcoin
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
donations they have a bitcoin address
 
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
and they use it for night vision goggles
 
03:31:23.030 --> 03:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
and for
 
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
bulletproof vests and you can send
 
03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
without any intermediary from your
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
smartphone right now directly to the
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
ukrainian government to support their
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
their efforts fighting the russians so
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's an example of it being used i
 
03:31:37.750 --> 03:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:37.760 --> 03:31:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i believe that this is a
 
03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
unique opportunity for the state of new
 
03:31:47.910 --> 03:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire to take a leadership position
 
03:31:49.990 --> 03:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
across all 50 states
 
03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
and we will have a lot of states
 
03:31:55.030 --> 03:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
following our lead after we get this as
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
a law thank you

then i assume there'll be a minority
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:02.830 --> 03:33:02.840 align:start position:0%

this is the 60 to get a budget
 
03:34:12.830 --> 03:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
budget yes
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
no well it's not special this is the
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
budget it's not just special yeah it's
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
the budget thank you thank you for the
 
03:34:19.200 --> 03:34:21.349 align:start position:0%
the budget thank you thank you for the
prompt

03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
prompt
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um yeah this would
 
03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
really hamstring the the boards the
 
03:34:29.110 --> 03:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
condo boards um that often have to make
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
a special assessment when something goes
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
wrong like you know
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
a roof leaks or something along that
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
line there are
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think that in general they're very
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable about
 
03:34:43.030 --> 03:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
spending money and not being foolish
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
about it so
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
we don't want to hamstring
 
03:34:48.070 --> 03:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
the boards also it would make it very
 
03:34:50.229 --> 03:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
difficult to get anybody to run for a
 
03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
board so i think this should be itled
 
03:34:55.349 --> 03:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on any speeding
 
03:34:56.870 --> 03:34:56.880 align:start position:0%

opposed
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
so moved unanimously
 
03:35:47.190 --> 03:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay 1380 relative installation of solar
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
photovoltaic energy systems by owners
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
subject to deed restrictions and a
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
homeowners association i have 12 49 next
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:05.359 --> 03:36:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:11.760 --> 03:36:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:36:13.190 --> 03:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:15.830 --> 03:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
1380 this is
 
03:36:17.460 --> 03:36:17.470 align:start position:0%
connie's bill
 
03:36:17.470 --> 03:36:19.750 align:start position:0%
connie's bill
[Laughter]

03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:36:24.389 --> 03:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.399 --> 03:36:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:31.269 --> 03:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's second by representative patusek
 
03:36:35.830 --> 03:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
the next legislate
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
um i think we had a good discussion good
 
03:36:39.590 --> 03:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
conversation and
 
03:36:42.309 --> 03:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day um when you buy a
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
condo you better read the
 
03:36:46.389 --> 03:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
fine print
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
and know what you're getting yourself
 
03:36:51.190 --> 03:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
into and uh if you want to be into solar
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
make sure your neighbors are just as
 
03:36:57.030 --> 03:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.190 --> 03:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative anthony uh you just use
 
03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
the trigger word that that makes me want
 
03:37:03.190 --> 03:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
to respond there are some misperceptions
 
03:37:04.790 --> 03:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
about this bill one is that it's not
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
economy oh that's right you're right it
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
is uh for homeowners associations in
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
which people actually own their roofs
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
own their lots on which they can make
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
these installations and so i think
 
03:37:16.870 --> 03:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that should be
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
considered as you vote regardless of how
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
you vote i also want to stipulate that
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is not a mandate it is enabling
 
03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:24.870 align:start position:0%
this is not a mandate it is enabling
legislation

03:37:24.870 --> 03:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
the localities the the cities and towns
 
03:37:28.229 --> 03:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
03:37:30.550 --> 03:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
enter have an inter intervening vote for
 
03:37:32.790 --> 03:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
that so there's no mandate involved here
 
03:37:34.389 --> 03:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
and just very quickly
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
um see some people seem to think that
 
03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
the deeds would have to be rewritten or
 
03:37:40.309 --> 03:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
that other docs would have to be or
 
03:37:41.830 --> 03:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
documents would have to be rewritten and
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
 
03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
the legislation as it's written would
 
03:37:47.349 --> 03:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
just nullify any kind of reference to
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
installation the photovoltaic systems so
 
03:37:51.190 --> 03:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll consider my constituents
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
and others across the state
 
03:37:56.550 --> 03:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
for whom
 
03:37:58.630 --> 03:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
obviously solar energy can be clean
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
efficient safe
 
03:38:01.990 --> 03:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
and something of the future that we can
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
implement today
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
i don't mean today as in now obviously
 
03:38:07.590 --> 03:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
because it has to have the enabling
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
legislation element beyond but i hope
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
you consider that thank you
 
03:38:15.510 --> 03:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative abramson um i agreed with
 
03:38:17.190 --> 03:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
the overall concept of the bill but i'm
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
not voting for the
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
the bill and the the
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
the reason is the structure of it when
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
we get bills that we agree with but we
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
go back to all the stakeholders so i
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
think it would be worth bringing it back
 
03:38:28.720 --> 03:38:29.429 align:start position:0%
think it would be worth bringing it back
in

03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
next year but i don't think we need to
 
03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
refer for interim study i think we need
 
03:38:35.110 --> 03:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
to send the sponsors back
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
and the the particular issue that i had
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
was in line two
 
03:38:40.550 --> 03:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
that a restriction shall be considered
 
03:38:41.830 --> 03:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for the purpose of this
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
section that's come up in both criminal
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
and civil law where the legislature just
 
03:38:47.429 --> 03:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
declares something
 
03:38:49.590 --> 03:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
without both sides being able to contest
 
03:38:50.950 --> 03:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
the issue in court
 
03:38:52.229 --> 03:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not something is reasonable
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
has to be decided in the case by case
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
basis for for a judge in my opinion um
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
and and looked at by the courts so
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell that's my the reason that
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm against it but i would be willing to
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
work in the future to put together
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
something different
 
03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
there you go okay
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
someone to work with okay the motion is
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
inexpensive to legislate any more
 
03:39:16.229 --> 03:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion scene on the
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
clerk we'll call the role representative
 
03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
patousik yes representative osborne
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes representative abramson

03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually it was interesting the the the
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
bill had had one point of view but it
 
03:40:52.150 --> 03:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
opened up a huge can of worms when we
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
realized how old the statute was and how
 
03:40:55.199 --> 03:40:56.309 align:start position:0%
realized how old the statute was and how
cumbersome

03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
03:40:57.750 --> 03:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
it is and given that the it was
 
03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
registration the registrar's which i
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't think i've seen one of those in a
 
03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:05.110 align:start position:0%
don't think i've seen one of those in a
hotel

03:41:05.110 --> 03:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's not even a bed and breakfast i
 
03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't think i've ever seen a registrar
 
03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
anymore i mean they're the age gone by i
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
think privacy keeps away from seeing
 
03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
that so people don't see the names but
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%

03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
companies so that um there are
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
situations where they may lose money on
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
towing a vehicle not all vehicles cost
 
03:49:20.550 --> 03:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
the same to tow
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
like the difference between trucks and
 
03:49:22.239 --> 03:49:23.590 align:start position:0%
like the difference between trucks and
cars

03:49:23.590 --> 03:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
cars
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
it also sets up a situation where the
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
tow company might not be available if
 
03:49:30.630 --> 03:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
for a call if they're
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with this particular
 
03:49:32.960 --> 03:49:34.309 align:start position:0%
dealing with this particular
situation

03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:49:34.319 --> 03:49:35.830 align:start position:0%
situation
um

03:49:35.830 --> 03:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:35.840 --> 03:49:37.030 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
so we we just felt that it would
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
put the business of private property tow
 
03:49:45.269 --> 03:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh private towing companies out
 
03:49:46.870 --> 03:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
of business if we were to pass this
 
03:49:46.880 --> 03:49:48.550 align:start position:0%
of business if we were to pass this
legislation

03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
so i think it should be inexpedient to
 
03:49:50.479 --> 03:49:52.790 align:start position:0%
so i think it should be inexpedient to
legislate

03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor urges us to kill it
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes that's right the sponsor also felt
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
it should be itl so thank you

intent of this bill we found that the um
 
03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
that it was really targeting the problem
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
from the wrong angle
 
03:51:48.309 --> 03:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
it was targeting the internet service

privacy needs needs to be addressed at
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
the federal level and that this should
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%

and
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
even though the the bill had um some
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
issues that i didn't agree with the
 
03:52:53.760 --> 03:52:55.349 align:start position:0%
issues that i didn't agree with the
underlying

03:52:55.349 --> 03:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
03:52:57.110 --> 03:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
idea that your internet service provider
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
would take
 
03:52:59.830 --> 03:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
information that that they'd gathered
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
from you um and sell it i didn't i
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
advocate of privacy and also the voters
 
03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
by a margin of i think ten to one passed
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know constitutional amendment
 
03:53:13.510 --> 03:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to the state constitution

03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
serious enough issue to hold on to the
 
03:53:16.800 --> 03:53:18.870 align:start position:0%

04:00:46.870 --> 04:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:00:48.389 --> 04:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
over and over again
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
but in a greater sense we've gone from
 
04:00:51.040 --> 04:00:51.910 align:start position:0%
but in a greater sense we've gone from
um

04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
i think it might have been afp
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we've gone from eight
 
04:00:57.429 --> 04:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
percent of workers having to get an
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
occupational license now it's gone up to
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
30 it looks like it's just going up and
 
04:01:02.070 --> 04:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
up and up
 
04:01:05.429 --> 04:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
and there was a study done um
 
04:01:07.830 --> 04:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
that showed that professional licensing
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
was one of the major
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
um unmentioned causes or contributors to
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
poverty and limiting income mobility so
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
for that reason felt that there were
 
04:01:21.510 --> 04:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons to want to open this up
 
04:01:23.349 --> 04:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
and felt that it needed a lot more time
 
04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
than just a hearing so for that reason i
 
04:01:27.429 --> 04:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to refer foreign representative
 
04:01:27.439 --> 04:01:28.469 align:start position:0%
wanted to refer foreign representative
bartlett

04:01:28.469 --> 04:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
bartlett
 
04:01:29.830 --> 04:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
um if you have an issue regarding
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh professional licensing that's one
 
04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
thing but the idea of replacing it with
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
the minimum liability insurance um is
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
there you're talking about apples and
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
oranges so um for that reason i would be
 
04:01:46.950 --> 04:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
opposing the interim steady and
 
04:01:50.070 --> 04:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
in favor of an itl
 
04:01:50.080 --> 04:01:51.189 align:start position:0%
in favor of an itl
okay

04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
any other yeah representative van gaal
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um the prevailing motion is
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
the pending motion motion yes sir thank
 
04:02:00.319 --> 04:02:02.229 align:start position:0%
the pending motion motion yes sir thank
you

04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
um it i it just strikes me that it's
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's a counter-intuitive to interim
 
04:02:10.389 --> 04:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
study something to study something
 
04:02:14.309 --> 04:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
and i i would prefer then the itl motion
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
04:02:18.150 --> 04:02:18.160 align:start position:0%

04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%

uh it was noted that this is also in
 
04:05:51.990 --> 04:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
labor correct and that's so why would we
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
not kill one of those two bills uh
 
04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
because we'll
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
we let them decide what they're going to
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
do and we'll just keep keep ours alive
 
04:06:02.880 --> 04:06:03.750 align:start position:0%
do and we'll just keep keep ours alive
if

04:06:03.750 --> 04:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%

04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative abrams yeah actual
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry if um
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
if you have two committees with a bill
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
aren't we in a better position just kind
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
of holding on to our bills so we're not
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
unless there's not a deadline on this
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
particular bill we could just recess
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
the this bill until
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
the end of uh no there is a deadline and
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
i mean there's both bills have to get
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
out at the same time
 
04:06:37.920 --> 04:06:38.830 align:start position:0%
out at the same time
okay

04:06:38.830 --> 04:06:38.840 align:start position:0%

replace the entire bill
um

04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
not that i have anything against farmers
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
but i i we want to be fair to everyone
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does will will reduce
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%

04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion on the motion about
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
to pass on the amendment can we just see
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
the difference between what the other
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
amendment was offering and what this
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
one's offering
 
04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
well she she the sponsor had come in
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
with another amendment that
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:09:15.750 --> 04:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know shuffle the chairs on the
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
titanic but didn't really
 
04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
get a yeah but she she had a heart
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
set on doing something for farmers
 
04:09:22.319 --> 04:09:24.389 align:start position:0%
set on doing something for farmers
right

04:09:24.389 --> 04:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
but this one okay so this isn't
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily farmers it's just anybody
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
and everybody
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
is that if you're going to
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do a less than a
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
thousand cases
 
04:09:34.560 --> 04:09:35.910 align:start position:0%
thousand cases
then

04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
then why pay
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
a license of 1
 
04:09:39.199 --> 04:09:40.710 align:start position:0%
a license of 1
692

04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
692
 
04:09:43.110 --> 04:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay why not have a cheap old license of
 
04:09:45.189 --> 04:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
300 bucks let's see my notes show that
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
um aidan moore was here
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
opposing the original
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
right the original because it was not
 
04:09:51.920 --> 04:09:53.670 align:start position:0%
right the original because it was not
enforceable

04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
04:09:55.349 --> 04:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
yeah because all that the whole farmer's
 
04:09:57.110 --> 04:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
requirement was don't believe a new
 
04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
license for farmers only
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh an approach that would be involved
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%

the consent calendar please say aye
 
04:12:18.309 --> 04:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
04:12:21.670 --> 04:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
okay next is uh house bill 1556 relative
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
to on-premise off-premise sales of
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:33.359 --> 04:12:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
this one is uh okay so this one we were
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
able to resolve this is the bill where
 
04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
it turns out that if you have a multiple
 
04:12:42.720 --> 04:12:44.229 align:start position:0%
it turns out that if you have a multiple
licenses

04:12:44.229 --> 04:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
04:12:44.239 --> 04:12:45.590 align:start position:0%
licenses
then

04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
it seemed it appeared to some
 
04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
licensees who had these multiple
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
licenses that they had to have two
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
separate point-of-sale systems
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
and um after a discussion with the
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
um they realized that then maybe there
 
04:13:05.349 --> 04:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
was some confusion out there about what
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
was going on
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
and they have sent out a bulletin
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
to all licensees to assure them that as
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
long as their software can handle
 
04:13:18.309 --> 04:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
separate sales which of course it can i
 
04:13:19.830 --> 04:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
mean that would be a pretty clunky
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
software if it can't and uh but that as
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
long as they're able to do that then
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
they would um they they're in compliance
 
04:13:27.840 --> 04:13:28.710 align:start position:0%
they would um they they're in compliance
and

04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would not be necessary however
 
04:13:32.550 --> 04:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
we always want to keep an eye on the
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
liquor commission so i'm recommending
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we enter and study this bill and
 
04:13:38.229 --> 04:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
discuss it come
 
04:13:39.510 --> 04:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
next uh
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
september justin made assured the
 
04:13:44.070 --> 04:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
bulletin was fulfilled and also there
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
was another request of another side
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
issue that was
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
so much remained
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
so we'll take that up in september when
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
we interim study the bill so
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%

moo's
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.189 --> 04:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative pilot
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chair um yeah i think that
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to put this into an
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
interim study we did have
 
04:14:11.910 --> 04:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from a number of business
 
04:14:11.920 --> 04:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
testimony from a number of business
owners

04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
owners
 
04:14:12.880 --> 04:14:13.670 align:start position:0%
owners
that

04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:15.189 --> 04:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
were getting some
 
04:14:15.199 --> 04:14:16.630 align:start position:0%
were getting some
contradictory

04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
contradictory
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
messages from it sounded like one
 
04:14:21.510 --> 04:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
particular auditor
 
04:14:25.110 --> 04:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
so i think if we can keep this
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
at least open enough to hear from
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
constituents or maybe we want to follow
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
up with them to find out if in fact it
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
has changed
 
04:14:33.359 --> 04:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
has changed
um

04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:38.550 --> 04:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
i think that makes sense good
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative i thought you said you
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
weren't going to talk too much today no
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
i don't talk too much okay okay i just
 
04:14:46.469 --> 04:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to remind members of the
 
04:14:47.830 --> 04:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee that i did have legislative
 
04:14:47.840 --> 04:14:49.030 align:start position:0%
committee that i did have legislative
services

04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:14:50.870 --> 04:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
put a proposed amendment if you want
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
language in front of you
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
so i just emailed it to all members of
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
the committee it was dealing with
 
04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
after researching this found there were
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
some areas where the person handing you
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
the bottle at
 
04:15:05.670 --> 04:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
different locations could be 14 15 16 18
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
so that's why i felt like it needed
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
some time
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay so that would be another issue
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
we'll take up in september
 
04:15:15.520 --> 04:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
we'll take up in september
okay

04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:23.110 --> 04:15:23.120 align:start position:0%

for those who have in front of you
 
04:16:53.670 --> 04:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
what's the amendment number oh here it
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
is okay
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
how's that number so
 
04:17:03.359 --> 04:17:04.630 align:start position:0%
how's that number so
284

04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
284
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah because i i did this
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
i introduced this amendment at the
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the underlying bill was to deal
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
with the issue to clarify even though
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
the attorney general did take a position
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
but it clarified that the previous
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
legislation that we passed
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
relative to a
 
04:17:33.670 --> 04:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer having a second
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
location that this clarifies that they
 
04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
do not need to manufacture
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
at that location
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is then carry
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
on to
 
04:17:47.110 --> 04:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
we'll dare to call housekeeping measures
 
04:17:48.870 --> 04:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the liquor commission
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
um one was it turns out that a little uh
 
04:17:53.830 --> 04:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
glitch in the
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
in the john hunt memorial direct
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
shipping law where the the law said
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
within a 90-day period
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
and the 90-day period was then used as
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
so that means i just lose my license for
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
90 days and then you have to give it
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
back to me 90 days from after
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
which is not exactly what we intended to
 
04:18:10.080 --> 04:18:11.269 align:start position:0%
which is not exactly what we intended to
do

04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
so with that this will remove that
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
90-day period
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
statement in the loss of licensure
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
the other issue came up was that um
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
at one point in time uh the the previous
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
audit done to the liquor commission was
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
why didn't the liquor commission offer
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
multi-year licenses
 
04:18:31.760 --> 04:18:32.550 align:start position:0%
multi-year licenses
so

04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission duly came in and
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
they added multi-year licenses
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
to the statute and
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
now five years later have discovered
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
that not a single licensee has ever
 
04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
requested a multi-year license and so
 
04:18:49.830 --> 04:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
the next audit that the looking
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
commission went through they suggested
 
04:18:54.870 --> 04:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
it be repealed and that's why it's in
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%

okay

04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%

04:20:48.800 --> 04:20:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
relative to location and days of
 
04:20:55.110 --> 04:20:55.120 align:start position:0%

representative hunt second

representative patusek moves out to pass

04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay so if you'll recall this bill uh
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
had um
 
04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
several parts in it uh
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
the first two sections were related um
 
04:21:25.920 --> 04:21:27.030 align:start position:0%
the first two sections were related um
to

04:21:27.030 --> 04:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
locate locating the
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh where the liquor stores can be
 
04:21:33.520 --> 04:21:34.950 align:start position:0%
uh where the liquor stores can be
um

04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
but the one that everybody we all we had
 
04:21:40.630 --> 04:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
most attention on to was the
 
04:21:43.030 --> 04:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
sunday and holiday opening section of
 
04:21:44.710 --> 04:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
and uh the question of being um
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
was uh easter
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh i guess we all pretty much in general
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
agree that that's a good idea probably
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
be closed for thanksgiving and christmas
 
04:21:56.159 --> 04:21:57.429 align:start position:0%
be closed for thanksgiving and christmas
day

04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
but after going through it and trying to
 
04:22:01.830 --> 04:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know like
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know trying to decide whether easter
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
is is important or
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
maybe adding
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
passover i don't know because that you
 
04:22:11.269 --> 04:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
know we could could go either way
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
then and i took one different look at it
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
i said well why don't we just if the
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
first sentence says the liquor
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
commission can make this decision in its
 
04:22:18.800 --> 04:22:20.149 align:start position:0%
commission can make this decision in its
destruction

04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
destruction
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it really is
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
based if you read in the later part of
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
the bill it's it's their ability to
 
04:22:26.229 --> 04:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
actually find employees who are willing
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
to work those days
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh for the commission even decide
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to be open those
 
04:22:30.800 --> 04:22:31.590 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to be open those
days

04:22:31.590 --> 04:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:22:33.429 --> 04:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
so i decided that wouldn't it be easier
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
just to get rid of all those
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
particular holidays
 
04:22:37.680 --> 04:22:39.269 align:start position:0%
particular holidays
and

04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
and the commission if they can you know
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
if they think they can find employees
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
who want to work on thanksgiving or
 
04:22:44.479 --> 04:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
who want to work on thanksgiving or
christmas

04:22:45.510 --> 04:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
christmas
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
then you know all the power to them but
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
not that i think that'll happen but
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
um at least at least the law is
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
consistent by not picking
 
04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
favorites when it comes to holidays
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
so i
 
04:23:01.830 --> 04:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
as i've
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
said before i didn't agree with the just
 
04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
the whole notion of
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know i i've never liked the idea of
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
the state operating state liquor stores
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
but just in particular having the state
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
decide and having the legislature decide
 
04:23:17.110 --> 04:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
that we'll it will allow the
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
liquor stores to be open on christmas
 
04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
day and easter and thanksgiving which
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
are kind of the three days where you
 
04:23:24.070 --> 04:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
really expect things to be closed we
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
used to have blue laws
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that said that you know
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
sunday mornings you're supposed to be
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know either at church or home with
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
your family um and those were repealed a
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
because no town was really following
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
them but this it just it kind of made me
 
04:23:40.710 --> 04:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
feel uncomf
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and a little bit odd
 
04:23:44.950 --> 04:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
that we were gonna pass legislation to
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
just have the liquor stores be open on
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
on the three holiest
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
um days of the year and i know for sure
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
that i'm gonna be hearing about this
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
when i go back to seabrook
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
well i don't know that their liquor
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
stores will be open in seabrook those
 
04:24:00.000 --> 04:24:02.550 align:start position:0%
stores will be open in seabrook those
days

04:24:02.550 --> 04:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett i think you make
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
a good point mr chair i think um if you
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
go back to seabrook and tell them that
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
they are going to be open that days you
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
would be incorrect this bill is only
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
saying that at liquor stores at their
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
discretion can do it and they've still
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
got to find people that are work so i
 
04:24:18.469 --> 04:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
think it's very unlikely that they're
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
going to be open um the days that you're
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
04:24:25.349 --> 04:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
so well
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to clean up the statute to
 
04:24:29.189 --> 04:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
have less regulations
 
04:24:29.199 --> 04:24:30.790 align:start position:0%
have less regulations
less

04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
well who's that way we all can say
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
you're not always consistent are you
 
04:24:45.670 --> 04:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
right well i do find it ironic that of
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
course you can always buy beer at the
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
04:24:55.349 --> 04:24:55.359 align:start position:0%

04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%

04:27:37.520 --> 04:27:39.990 align:start position:0%
to pat no excuse me interim study intro
study

04:27:39.990 --> 04:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
interim study on
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh 10 28. representative abramson's
 
04:27:48.550 --> 04:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:27:50.800 --> 04:27:51.830 align:start position:0%
so um
this

04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
is also a republican platform bill
 
04:27:56.790 --> 04:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
and it touched on several different
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
planks in the republican platform
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
so that was one side of it yet the other
 
04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
issue is the rising health care costs
 
04:28:05.910 --> 04:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
aren't just taking a lot of money out of
 
04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
our pocket but our constituents pockets
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
um costs have been going up at i think
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
seven or eight or nine percent per year
 
04:28:12.720 --> 04:28:14.070 align:start position:0%
seven or eight or nine percent per year
um

04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:16.710 --> 04:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
and we we have this you know this is a
 
04:28:17.830 --> 04:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee where we have to do do
 
04:28:19.510 --> 04:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
something about it and really dig into
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
the details of the details in order to
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get costs down
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
and then the last part was
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
that when i've gone to when i was on my
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
the town's budget committee and we're
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
looking at what's driving up our
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
property taxes by far the number one
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
issue was rising health care costs so we
 
04:28:37.349 --> 04:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
needed i felt that we needed to really
 
04:28:39.349 --> 04:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
dig into this
 
04:28:40.950 --> 04:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
and look at ways to open up health care
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason i felt that we
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
needed to put more time
 
04:28:49.510 --> 04:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
into health care issues and insurance
 
04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
but especially health insurance issues
 
04:28:52.880 --> 04:28:55.349 align:start position:0%
but especially health insurance issues
okay

04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.149 --> 04:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion of interim
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:29:03.030 --> 04:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative parliament
 
04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
i'm shaking my head because i thought
 
04:29:06.389 --> 04:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
this was going to be your opportunity to
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
talk about insurance 101.
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
yes we could do that
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
would have a tough time supporting an
 
04:29:16.389 --> 04:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
interim study on this one i probably
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
will but i'm not going to like it
 
04:29:18.399 --> 04:29:19.990 align:start position:0%
will but i'm not going to like it
um

04:29:19.990 --> 04:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:20.000 --> 04:29:21.269 align:start position:0%
um
uh

04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
i am i also take issue with the idea
 
04:29:25.349 --> 04:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
that insurance premiums have been going
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
up seven eight and nine percent per year
 
04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
we do have mr brandon here with us from
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance department and maybe he
 
04:29:33.110 --> 04:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
could speak to the kind of increases
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
that um insurance has been
 
04:29:36.319 --> 04:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
that um insurance has been
um

04:29:37.110 --> 04:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
we'll get that we'll get there when they
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
get to this okay okay
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
yeah that'll be i'm i'm willing to
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
tolerate this motion in the sense that
 
04:29:50.070 --> 04:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
that obviously
 
04:29:52.149 --> 04:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of new members on
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
republican side on this committee who
 
04:29:56.469 --> 04:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
really don't have learned
 
04:29:56.479 --> 04:29:58.469 align:start position:0%
really don't have learned
why

04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know why why insurance is what it is
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
and how we got here and understand what
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
the short-term policy was i mean it was
 
04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
very nice that tyler mailed it out to
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
everybody and i'm sure
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative abramson read it
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
what he was sent and knowing how
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
the short-term policies are de minimis
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
and violate the
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh the affordable care act uh other than
 
04:30:21.830 --> 04:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
the extent that the affordable care act
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
is tolerated
 
04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
that it would be a six month only
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
probably a six month with i don't know
 
04:30:28.710 --> 04:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
or three months with one renewal was
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
that it was something like that
 
04:30:33.189 --> 04:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
but at any rate
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
if people we we
 
04:30:36.870 --> 04:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's worth having something to
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
understand why health insurance is what
 
04:30:41.830 --> 04:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
it is and this is a good vehicle to do
 
04:30:46.389 --> 04:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on the motion of
 
04:30:53.429 --> 04:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm probably going to vote
 
04:30:57.750 --> 04:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
i actually will vote for the interim
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
study although my preference is the itl
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just i just have a concern that we
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
our entire state and talk about
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
platforms as being a reason to make a
 
04:31:10.720 --> 04:31:11.910 align:start position:0%
platforms as being a reason to make a
vote

04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:31:13.750 --> 04:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of which side you're on and i
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to register that concern
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you fair enough
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
04:31:21.429 --> 04:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
yes i oppose this bill and i will be
 
04:31:23.429 --> 04:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
voting against it
 
04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is offering
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
insurance that doesn't
 
04:31:30.630 --> 04:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
have adequate coverage and we should not
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative greeson
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i see this as an
 
04:31:40.389 --> 04:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity whether or not short-term
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
insurance is anything anybody wants to
 
04:31:42.640 --> 04:31:43.429 align:start position:0%
insurance is anything anybody wants to
buy

04:31:43.429 --> 04:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
buy
 
04:31:46.309 --> 04:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
is is uh is immaterial to me but i see
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
this as being an opportunity to at least
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
begin the discussion of
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh we need something to compete against
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.600 --> 04:31:58.550 align:start position:0%

there is concern

there is concern
that

that
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody receives a

but is allowed to be used under

04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
insurance company may not
 
04:34:13.680 --> 04:34:16.150 align:start position:0%
insurance company may not
cover

04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%

04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction or effect
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
device or treatment or vaccine or
 
04:34:23.600 --> 04:34:25.029 align:start position:0%

04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
medication
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so this bill was uh
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
was intended to require them
 
04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's
 
04:34:37.840 --> 04:34:38.869 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's
comfort

04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
comfort
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
a settled this that that actually they
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
will cover it supposedly they would
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
but if we put it to interim study this
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
gives us an opportunity to
 
04:34:53.590 --> 04:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
do a little bit more digging into what
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
exactly insurance companies are required
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
for emergency youth use authorization
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
medications and any effects that might
 
04:35:04.561 --> 04:35:05.510 align:start position:0%
medications and any effects that might
be

04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:35:07.590 --> 04:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
 
04:35:09.269 --> 04:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
i think there's a greater problem or
 
04:35:11.510 --> 04:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
risk that goes beyond the scope of this
 
04:35:11.520 --> 04:35:12.869 align:start position:0%
risk that goes beyond the scope of this
legislation

04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
but at least as far as this is concerned
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
i think that's the aim of it and i think
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
we can look into it
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that yes indeed
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
they are covering it we'll cover it and
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
if we need to pass them that requires
 
04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
