meeting with public hearing the work
 
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:26.860 align:start position:0%
session I shall say
 
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:31.510 align:start position:0%
and we will start with
 
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:39.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:42.410 align:start position:0%
I have brought forward an amendment that
 
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:45.580 align:start position:0%
I think everybody has in front of them
 
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.449 align:start position:0%
I think everybody has in front of them
and

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:48.459 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
we have a minute to get that in front of
 
00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:53.029 align:start position:0%
you and then I will discuss what this
 
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:01.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.070 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
and the first thing it does is it
 
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:19.820 align:start position:0%
corrects the first part of the amendment
 
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:25.390 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much most of it redefines what
 
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:31.300 align:start position:0%
had happened was
 
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
it was a drafting error in OLS
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
143 - a : 25 was put in there twice
 
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:42.590 align:start position:0%
and we all know that he can't have the
 
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:44.930 align:start position:0%
same citation in statute twice with
 
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:47.900 align:start position:0%
different meanings so it corrected that
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
and it made a 25 to 26 and a 27 so
 
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
that's all that corrected in the
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:13:01.950 align:start position:0%
that's all that corrected in the
amendment

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:12.710 align:start position:0%
if I man just the other part of the
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
if I man just the other part of the
amendment

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:14.410 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:19.450 align:start position:0%
Rick Lee takes out the definition
 
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:22.730 align:start position:0%
removes the definition of commodity in
 
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:24.740 align:start position:0%
the partner rule so wild harvested
 
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
mushrooms this was at the request of the
 
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:29.390 align:start position:0%
department in the sponsor response I had
 
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.210 align:start position:0%
this amendment usually drafted most of
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
us had it had it in front of us and when
 
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
this went out to be put in my name
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
because OLS said we could not accept any
 
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
other members amendment it had to be
 
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:43.490 align:start position:0%
from a committee member so that's why I
 
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.380 align:start position:0%
had that drafted and when drafting it
 
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:46.970 align:start position:0%
they noticed the other drafting error
 
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
so if there are any questions on the
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
amendment you could raise your hand and
 
00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:58.670 align:start position:0%
then once we get done the amendment I
 
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:00.650 align:start position:0%
will recognize representative fellows
 
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.050 align:start position:0%
who sat on the Commission to give an
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
update as to what was that
 
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.330 align:start position:0%
mr. chairman representative Hanna city
 
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:11.290 align:start position:0%
has his hand up
 
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:13.970 align:start position:0%
mr. Chairman I don't have a copy of the
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
mr. Chairman I don't have a copy of the
amendment

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:15.850 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:17.930 align:start position:0%
everyone should have had a copy in a
 
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:20.390 align:start position:0%
packet that Pam sent out there was a
 
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:21.820 align:start position:0%

committee members was also posted on the
 
00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:39.339 align:start position:0%
general court website under the remote
 
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:41.850 align:start position:0%
meetings link on that main page that
 
00:14:44.609 --> 00:14:44.619 align:start position:0%
might be the easiest way to access it
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:14:50.369 --> 00:14:50.379 align:start position:0%

before I turn it over to represent
 
00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:36.410 align:start position:0%

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:38.739 align:start position:0%
seeing none represent fellows who are
 
00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:41.019 align:start position:0%
recognized this one's on you but you may
 
00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:44.269 align:start position:0%

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.229 --> 00:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:49.149 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that I served on
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
the study Commission for this bill and
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
this is bill that we heard last year
 
00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:58.660 align:start position:0%
it's just to make to form the study
 
00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:01.029 align:start position:0%
committee and I served on a study
 
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:03.850 align:start position:0%
committee and I think there's a very
 
00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:07.689 align:start position:0%
strong support from all quarters for the
 
00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:10.629 align:start position:0%
concept to license wild mushroom
 
00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:14.799 align:start position:0%
harvesters it would be good for the food
 
00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:17.769 align:start position:0%
industry and it also protects the
 
00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:22.709 align:start position:0%
citizens because they will be given
 
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:24.970 align:start position:0%
guarantees so that the mushrooms that
 
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:27.220 align:start position:0%
they buy either through a restaurant or
 
00:16:29.929 --> 00:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
at a farm stand are safe
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
this bill was amended by the Agriculture
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:42.309 align:start position:0%
they shift one of the things that they
 
00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:44.649 align:start position:0%
did is from the original bill to this
 
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:47.980 align:start position:0%
version they shifted responsibility some
 
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:50.020 align:start position:0%
of the responsibilities from the
 
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:52.330 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to the
 
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.310 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that in I have some concerns
 
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:03.310 align:start position:0%
I think in a normal situation this bill
 
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:05.290 align:start position:0%
would be great to just go to the Senate
 
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note says that the costs are
 
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:12.370 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and this doesn't have an
 
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to house finance
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
because we are the second committee but
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
I have concerns that the
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
the cost and the staffing that would be
 
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:27.820 align:start position:0%
required to implement this by Health and
 
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:29.890 align:start position:0%
Human Services has not been addressed
 
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:33.460 align:start position:0%
some of the costs are not identified in
 
00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:35.260 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note in the fiscal note
 
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:38.590 align:start position:0%
interment also determines that the cost
 
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:40.300 align:start position:0%
they did it and to play have an
 
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.020 align:start position:0%
they did it and to play have an
indeterminable

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.030 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.030 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
next I am going to
 
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.220 align:start position:0%
next I am going to
recognize

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:55.230 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:57.940 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith if she can address the
 
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:00.970 align:start position:0%
cost items okay if you could unmute her
 
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
if she's here he is here she is
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
and also representative Connor has his
 
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:11.310 align:start position:0%
hand up now
 
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:15.430 align:start position:0%
Colleen's hand is up and Colleen is here
 
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.250 align:start position:0%
with us Colleen you recognized to
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
address those questions and concerns
 
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:24.370 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Colleen Smith
 
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:25.750 align:start position:0%
I'm an administrator for the food
 
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:28.780 align:start position:0%
protection section within the Department
 
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:30.730 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
 
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:33.190 align:start position:0%
I served also on the same Commission
 
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:36.460 align:start position:0%
that representative fellows did we you
 
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
know certainly tried to model the this
 
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:41.770 align:start position:0%
program similar to a program that we
 
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:43.930 align:start position:0%
have for rabbit and poultry producers
 
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
have for rabbit and poultry producers
and

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.330 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.850 align:start position:0%
and
also

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:50.170 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that there were some there
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
was some startup work we collaborated
 
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:55.900 align:start position:0%
with Department of Agriculture and UNH
 
00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.050 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension and to develop a
 
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:02.710 align:start position:0%
curriculum and a program this it's a
 
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:04.780 align:start position:0%
similar model with this mushroom wild
 
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:07.390 align:start position:0%
mushroom program in that we would also
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
collaborate again with the UNH Extension
 
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:12.850 align:start position:0%
and with Department of Agriculture so
 
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:14.530 align:start position:0%
certainly there are some start there's
 
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
some start up work meetings discussion
 
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:20.770 align:start position:0%
but that is that's why we had outline
 
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:23.530 align:start position:0%
this is indeterminable cost the program
 
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:25.690 align:start position:0%
was to be the curriculum is to be
 
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:29.470 align:start position:0%
administered by UNH UNH extension or a
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.610 align:start position:0%
administered by UNH UNH extension or a
similar

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:33.550 align:start position:0%
University that has that capability
 
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:36.910 align:start position:0%
should UNH not be able to move forward
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
with this in the future
 
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:40.990 align:start position:0%
that was the model that we had based on
 
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.050 align:start position:0%
again very similar to a program that we
 
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.150 align:start position:0%
had it collaborated with those two
 
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:48.910 align:start position:0%
entities a few years ago so we're not
 
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:51.450 align:start position:0%
expecting that there would be
 
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
you know certainly a need for a position
 
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:55.900 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this that this could be
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
absorbed within the course of our
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
regular work there are some licensing
 
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:01.930 align:start position:0%
costs that are built in you know
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
certainly we would go through rulemaking
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
process to set those and again we
 
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:10.900 align:start position:0%
because this is a new program it's it's
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
hard to say how many
 
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:16.450 align:start position:0%
how many the actual licensees we would
 
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
have we estimated I think I believe 30
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
over the course of the first few years
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
that would take advantage of this
 
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.260 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to answer any other
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
questions that you have I
 
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:31.830 align:start position:0%
see represented McGuire has a hand of
 
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.350 align:start position:0%
represent of wire Thank You mr. chair I
 
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.020 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions the first is
 
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:41.500 align:start position:0%
did the committee find any actual cases
 
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.250 align:start position:0%
of poisoning but by wild mushrooms in
 
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:47.550 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
where does that fellows the money is
 
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
where does that fellows the money is
that

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.090 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
that
I

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.130 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:55.780 align:start position:0%
don't recall any discussion about that
 
00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:58.810 align:start position:0%
happening within the state but it
 
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:01.150 align:start position:0%
definitely has happened in other parts
 
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.210 align:start position:0%
of the country
 
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.090 align:start position:0%
and in the
 
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:11.170 align:start position:0%
approach of the committee is to have two
 
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:14.710 align:start position:0%
tiers of mushrooms in Tier one mushrooms
 
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:17.850 align:start position:0%
are those that are easily
 
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:25.650 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:28.540 align:start position:0%
be licensed to harvest those mushrooms
 
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:31.030 align:start position:0%
there's a second tier when where
 
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:33.100 align:start position:0%
somebody would need and a lot of
 
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:37.060 align:start position:0%
experience to be able to distinguish the
 
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
ones that are dangerous so our objective
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that that there is no
 
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:47.830 align:start position:0%
poisoning we would have to try to
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
contact the poison Bureau you know to to
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're muted
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
can we get
 
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:15.630 align:start position:0%
the my concern is that the we're
 
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.190 align:start position:0%
creating a lot of work for a problem
 
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:20.590 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist in the state but
 
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:22.510 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss that later my other
 
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:26.610 align:start position:0%
question is that this talks about
 
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
requiring mushrooms from out of state to
 
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
be from people suitably licensed by the
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:39.100 align:start position:0%
miss Pam do we know what our adjacent
 
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:40.990 align:start position:0%
states do about mushroom gatherers
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
because that is obviously going to be an
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
issue and
 
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
Canada -
 
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.380 align:start position:0%
Canada -
um

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:48.390 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:50.740 align:start position:0%
the committee certainly looked at other
 
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:52.750 align:start position:0%
states regulating I don't have that
 
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:54.850 align:start position:0%
information in front of me I don't know
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
if representative fellows or
 
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:00.460 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk have as many fellows
 
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:03.930 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:08.110 align:start position:0%
so I can I can tell you some of that we
 
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
know that in in Maine they several years
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
ago they passed a bill
 
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.070 align:start position:0%
providing that mushroom harvesters can
 
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.410 align:start position:0%
be licensed but they never implemented
 
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.010 align:start position:0%
it because they ran into some
 
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.780 align:start position:0%
it because they ran into some
issues

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:29.380 align:start position:0%
which I can't remember offhand I can't
 
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.020 align:start position:0%
remember what those issues were and the
 
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:35.230 align:start position:0%
committee also talked to someone from
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and
 
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:40.350 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:42.940 align:start position:0%
licensing some people but they don't
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
really have a formal process like we're
 
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:47.950 align:start position:0%
talking about now they just kind of take
 
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:52.650 align:start position:0%
it on a one at a time basis and I can't
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.150 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in Vermont I I think
 
00:23:59.910 --> 00:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
probably they just don't because I think
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
we would have discussed it if they did
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's the scope of what I can share
 
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
Thank You Pam can we get I know
 
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:11.110 align:start position:0%
represent connect us and further info on
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
represent connect us and further info on
that

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:12.330 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.950 align:start position:0%
that
sure

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:17.740 align:start position:0%
representative connect you should be
 
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:21.750 align:start position:0%
able to speak you're all set up now
 
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:26.410 align:start position:0%
he's now he now you're ready okay yes
 
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:28.750 align:start position:0%
well let me first of all if I missed
 
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:30.580 align:start position:0%
something when represent a fellow's was
 
00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:32.140 align:start position:0%
speaking of us because I was checking in
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
that amendment but I hope I'm not being
 
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:36.130 align:start position:0%
redundant the most important issue that
 
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:39.820 align:start position:0%
understand is the 2017 us food code
 
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:42.910 align:start position:0%
states that unless a food service in an
 
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:44.890 align:start position:0%
order for a food service establishment
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
to serve or sell wild harvested
 
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:48.850 align:start position:0%
mushrooms in the US they have to be
 
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:50.710 align:start position:0%
approved to do so by a regulatory
 
00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:52.900 align:start position:0%
authority worth jurisdiction over the
 
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:54.460 align:start position:0%
food establishment so this would be any
 
00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants any grocery stores farmers
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
markets all those things and that
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
approval requires the proper
 
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
identification of the wild mushrooms
 
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:05.230 align:start position:0%
being sold or served so the point is
 
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:09.550 align:start position:0%
without this program the the restaurants
 
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:11.770 align:start position:0%
who are currently serving wild mushrooms
 
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.050 align:start position:0%
that have been sold to them or grocery
 
00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:15.820 align:start position:0%
stores will not be allowed to do that
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
anymore currently if an inspector goes
 
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:20.890 align:start position:0%
in and they see a wild mushroom which is
 
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
in and they see a wild mushroom which is
not

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:21.810 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:25.810 align:start position:0%
identified as a as approved it has to be
 
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:28.450 align:start position:0%
pulled and thrown away so this is
 
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:30.130 align:start position:0%
actually just to allow us to be in
 
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:32.970 align:start position:0%
compliance with the US Food Code for our
 
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants and grocery stores farm
 
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:39.220 align:start position:0%
stands and farmers markets to sell or
 
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:41.980 align:start position:0%
serve wild harvested mushrooms and
 
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:43.890 align:start position:0%
that's really the major Reese why it
 
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be put in place with response
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
to the issue of poisoning it isn't
 
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
always even just an issue of a person
 
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:53.790 align:start position:0%
getting markedly sick and dying with
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
renal failure a padi failure or whatever
 
00:25:58.670 --> 00:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
there are also mushrooms that are just
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
simply not very edible and the the must
 
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:05.790 align:start position:0%
early I should say that the restaurant
 
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:07.470 align:start position:0%
would not really like it if they
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
purchased some mushrooms they thought
 
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:10.770 align:start position:0%
were fine they served them and they were
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
just tough chewy and edible and also
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
other times they caused just a mild
 
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
degree of illness gastrointestinal
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
illness it's not reported to a poison
 
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:20.910 align:start position:0%
center and some of these that have a
 
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:22.530 align:start position:0%
high incidence today I will go on that
 
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
your to list the representative fellows
 
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
discussed but the issue is to make sure
 
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:29.790 align:start position:0%
that when somebody goes in to sell to a
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
restaurant or to a grocery store a store
 
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:34.710 align:start position:0%
or to a farmers market if they're
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
selling at the farmers market that what
 
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:39.750 align:start position:0%
they're selling is actually what is safe
 
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:41.430 align:start position:0%
to sell and that they know what they're
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.490 align:start position:0%
to sell and that they know what they're
doing

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:42.500 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:46.410 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and represent if can
 
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
arc one quick question for you yes sir
 
00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have to use the why we
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
have to do this because of in the FDA
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
code is because Health and Human
 
00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
Services has adopted that code is that
 
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:01.710 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes exactly the the point is
 
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
the US Food Code is there and the the
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
the our food protection service is
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
adopted they rules for that and that I
 
00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:15.110 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the actual
 
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:17.850 align:start position:0%
rule and that it was sent to you by
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
email I sent out an email to everybody
 
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.050 align:start position:0%
back a week or so ago summarizing all
 
00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.050 align:start position:0%
this and again it's definitely says
 
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.130 align:start position:0%
mushroom species picked in the wild
 
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:28.410 align:start position:0%
shall not be offered for sale or service
 
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:30.510 align:start position:0%
by a food establishment unless the food
 
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:32.550 align:start position:0%
establishment has been approved to do so
 
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
and it does not apply to processed
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
mushrooms or cultivated mushrooms that
 
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:41.490 align:start position:0%
are inspected it just has to do with the
 
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:45.710 align:start position:0%
gathering of wild thank you
 
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:49.610 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
represented merchants has his hand up
 
00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:54.830 align:start position:0%
where is our merchant
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chair
 
00:27:58.659 --> 00:27:58.669 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking through the bill and
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
also to the amendment I don't see really
 
00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:02.779 align:start position:0%
a definition of a wild mushroom and what
 
00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:05.419 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about is that the species
 
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.010 align:start position:0%
may be grown in the wild as well as
 
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.090 align:start position:0%
cultivated so therefore if we how do we
 
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:12.770 align:start position:0%
categorize something so someone
 
00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
understands that if it's grown in the
 
00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:16.669 align:start position:0%
wild it's wild regardless of the species
 
00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:18.950 align:start position:0%
if it's cultivated it's cultivated
 
00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:20.409 align:start position:0%
regardless of the species
 
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:23.090 align:start position:0%
is there any comment about that is my
 
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.090 align:start position:0%
concern I
 
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:27.950 align:start position:0%
think represented cannot just read the
 
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:30.740 align:start position:0%
definition and it was clearly stated in
 
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:32.690 align:start position:0%
the FDA code that cultivator is not
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.769 align:start position:0%
the FDA code that cultivator is not
included

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:34.779 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:38.450 align:start position:0%
if we could maybe unmute calling Smith
 
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:40.610 align:start position:0%
and she may have also have a better
 
00:28:46.889 --> 00:28:46.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:51.140 align:start position:0%
yes yes that is Curtis correct as
 
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:53.990 align:start position:0%
representative Konerko stated in the
 
00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:55.190 align:start position:0%
definition of the code is that
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
cultivated mushrooms would not be
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
included as a wild mushroom these are
 
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:04.970 align:start position:0%
these are meant to cover eye mushrooms
 
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:07.270 align:start position:0%
that would be foraged in the wild not
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
through a controlled environment as
 
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:14.020 align:start position:0%
cultivated mushrooms would be
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:21.980 align:start position:0%
Judy is in the attendee lesson has his
 
00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:26.049 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:30.980 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr. chair I have a
 
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:34.610 align:start position:0%
same concern like whip is that is not my
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.490 align:start position:0%
same concern like whip is that is not my
gear

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:35.500 align:start position:0%
gear
 
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:39.830 align:start position:0%
as all of you knows I come from an
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
island Haiti and
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
for the wild mushroom in Haiti
 
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:51.490 align:start position:0%
we we don't eat those mushrooms because
 
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.010 align:start position:0%
they are poisoning so I would like to
 
00:29:59.980 --> 00:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
know if there is a study about it in
 
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.210 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.979 --> 00:30:11.989 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.019 --> 00:30:14.029 align:start position:0%
cannot you just want to explain the tier
 
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
1 and tier 2 to represented Julian now
 
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:19.340 align:start position:0%
they would be identified but yes may I
 
00:30:23.139 --> 00:30:23.149 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yes yes ok basically
 
00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:25.789 align:start position:0%
we we had on our Commission I chaired
 
00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:27.139 align:start position:0%
that Commission and we had on that
 
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:30.580 align:start position:0%
Commission dr. Rick van de Paul who is
 
00:30:32.639 --> 00:30:32.649 align:start position:0%
the head of the Ring of mycology
 
00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:34.789 align:start position:0%
Association and we also had another
 
00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:37.369 align:start position:0%
active forager and we also had testimony
 
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
from other foragers we developed a list
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
together as we work through we actually
 
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:44.690 align:start position:0%
had a very long and large list we kept
 
00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:46.729 align:start position:0%
whittling it down to try to make it a
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more manageable in any case
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh the data about these is constantly
 
00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:54.529 align:start position:0%
changing and that's why in the bill it
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't list these other mushrooms if
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
you know and from time it from here on
 
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:02.450 align:start position:0%
it states that a list will be maintained
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
because that list will need to be
 
00:31:06.039 --> 00:31:06.049 align:start position:0%
updated on occasion when new information
 
00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:09.109 align:start position:0%
comes in about a mushroom which might
 
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:10.690 align:start position:0%
have a toxicity or
 
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:13.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes mushrooms have name changes
 
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:15.710 align:start position:0%
and that would need to be changed as
 
00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:17.809 align:start position:0%
well so that will be a living document
 
00:31:19.989 --> 00:31:19.999 align:start position:0%
that will be maintained by the
 
00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:21.409 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.190 align:start position:0%
and that would be allowed to be we would
 
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:26.470 align:start position:0%
be actually
 
00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:28.429 align:start position:0%
updating that and that kind of
 
00:31:30.099 --> 00:31:30.109 align:start position:0%
information is sent out to the food
 
00:31:32.889 --> 00:31:32.899 align:start position:0%
establishments as well so they know but
 
00:31:36.249 --> 00:31:36.259 align:start position:0%
in any case we do have a good wealth of
 
00:31:38.139 --> 00:31:38.149 align:start position:0%
information about toxicity of arras
 
00:31:40.089 --> 00:31:40.099 align:start position:0%
mushrooms but as anything else in
 
00:31:41.739 --> 00:31:41.749 align:start position:0%
medicine as we learn new things we have
 
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:43.940 align:start position:0%
to update the data that we have and this
 
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:46.220 align:start position:0%
would be updated to represent that does
 
00:31:49.169 --> 00:31:49.179 align:start position:0%
that answer your question I hope
 
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:52.700 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you visit a few
 
00:31:55.899 --> 00:31:55.909 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
00:31:57.989 --> 00:31:57.999 align:start position:0%
or comments

Thank You mr. chairman I'm glad we're
 
00:32:08.139 --> 00:32:08.149 align:start position:0%
having this discussion because I think
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
it's very important for people to
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
food safety is not some kind of a mild
 
00:32:18.009 --> 00:32:18.019 align:start position:0%
concern we already have enough problems
 
00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:22.549 align:start position:0%
with you know improperly and hygienic
 
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:25.580 align:start position:0%
the produced meats that have poisoning
 
00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:27.649 align:start position:0%
in several instances in our recent
 
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:31.070 align:start position:0%
history killed people and some of the
 
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:32.990 align:start position:0%
flesh rumors some of the wild mushrooms
 
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:35.350 align:start position:0%
even having their name
 
00:32:38.739 --> 00:32:38.749 align:start position:0%
there's a word deadly how anita comes to
 
00:32:41.109 --> 00:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
Maya and it's called deadly I'm Anita
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
and this is the kind of thing that the
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
average person knows nothing about so
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
having these licensed certified
 
00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:54.169 align:start position:0%
harvesters and so forth it is in the
 
00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:56.409 align:start position:0%
public interest and
 
00:32:59.169 --> 00:32:59.179 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be strongly supportive of
 
00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:03.309 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:07.429 align:start position:0%
representative Bowden has a hand up and
 
00:33:09.159 --> 00:33:09.169 align:start position:0%
if I just may remind people this is a
 
00:33:11.049 --> 00:33:11.059 align:start position:0%
work session not an exact session to be
 
00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:12.409 align:start position:0%
making comments on how they're going to
 
00:33:14.169 --> 00:33:14.179 align:start position:0%
vote on this bill yet we're not there
 
00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:16.700 align:start position:0%
thank you represent a boat Thank You mr.
 
00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.070 align:start position:0%
chair I noticed in the bill that we are
 
00:33:24.249 --> 00:33:24.259 align:start position:0%
granting DHHS the authority to issue to
 
00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:26.809 align:start position:0%
create a fine schedule for violations of
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
the subdivision in my eight years in the
 
00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:32.269 align:start position:0%
legislature this is the first time I've
 
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:34.330 align:start position:0%
ever seen or haven't noticed at least
 
00:33:38.289 --> 00:33:38.299 align:start position:0%
whereas we've granted the state agency
 
00:33:41.799 --> 00:33:41.809 align:start position:0%
the authority to create a fine schedule
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's that we should in the least
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
specify what the fine schedule is in
 
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:52.190 align:start position:0%
this bill before it's moved on to an
 
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:55.940 align:start position:0%
executive session Thank You Pam correct
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong this is done in other
 
00:33:59.680 --> 00:33:59.690 align:start position:0%
agencies as well correct well this isn't
 
00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:00.950 align:start position:0%
the first time we've done something like
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
this for an agency that's true you know
 
00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:07.340 align:start position:0%
there's as with you know a number of
 
00:34:10.539 --> 00:34:10.549 align:start position:0%
laws and little uniformity sometimes the
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
fees are set in sections sometimes
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
they're not correct thank you sure and
 
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.030 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has her hand up
 
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
McGuire Thank You mr. chair
 
00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:26.149 align:start position:0%
so I am I didn't get representative
 
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:29.980 align:start position:0%
Kirk's email about the
 
00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:34.970 align:start position:0%
adopting the federal code for foods and
 
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:38.690 align:start position:0%
I think that's necessary
 
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
represent Koerner can we get you to send
 
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:45.530 align:start position:0%
that back out uh yes I can do that
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
within just a moment I can also simply
 
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:50.450 align:start position:0%
read it to you if you wish or better yet
 
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
Coleen Smith is still on the call likely
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
and she would be the expert on then who
 
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:04.100 align:start position:0%
miss Matthew just want to address how
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
healthy Human Services deals with the
 
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
food code
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
so we have adopted the 2017 version of
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
the food code that's the latest model
 
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:17.060 align:start position:0%
code for the regulation of food
 
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:19.310 align:start position:0%
establishments so that version was
 
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
adopted into our administrative rules
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
through gel car approval back in August
 
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:28.310 align:start position:0%
of 2019 so previous to that we were on
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
the 2009 code which also did address
 
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:35.390 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms and at that time we had
 
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:38.330 align:start position:0%
we had taken at that time that code had
 
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:40.970 align:start position:0%
said there needed to be a wild mushroom
 
00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:44.540 align:start position:0%
expert in the state and so we had not we
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
had not allowed wild mushrooms
 
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:48.650 align:start position:0%
altogether because we had no wild
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
mushroom expert in the state the 2017
 
00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:53.930 align:start position:0%
code allows for the state to come up
 
00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
with its own certification program and
 
00:35:59.050 --> 00:35:59.060 align:start position:0%
that's certainly the model that we
 
00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:01.220 align:start position:0%
followed through this out the study
 
00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:03.500 align:start position:0%
commissioned in which we proposed here
 
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:05.810 align:start position:0%
too and it very much aligns with the
 
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:09.830 align:start position:0%
2017 FDA code which are which is part of
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules
 
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:16.210 align:start position:0%
and if a restaurant wanted to
 
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:20.050 align:start position:0%
serve wild mushrooms currently
 
00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.450 align:start position:0%
would they be able to I know a lot of
 
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:24.980 align:start position:0%
restaurants around are going to the
 
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:27.170 align:start position:0%
farm-to-table are trying to use local
 
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:29.330 align:start position:0%
resources for their products and what
 
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:31.250 align:start position:0%
they serve currently are they allowed
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
they serve currently are they allowed
you

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.070 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
so currently there's no approval process
 
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:38.930 align:start position:0%
in the state for them so as was
 
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:41.570 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously if an inspector
 
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
visited that restaurant that had that
 
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:47.060 align:start position:0%
was choosing to offer a wild mushrooms
 
00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:48.830 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't consider them an approved
 
00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:51.230 align:start position:0%
source unless they were buying them from
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
a purveyor that had
 
00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:55.550 align:start position:0%
received them from a certified source
 
00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:57.140 align:start position:0%
from another state or another country
 
00:36:59.500 --> 00:36:59.510 align:start position:0%
but currently New Hampshire doesn't have
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
an approval process for wild mushrooms
 
00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:04.340 align:start position:0%
so if they were deemed to be obtained
 
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:06.070 align:start position:0%
from a New Hampshire source
 
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:08.530 align:start position:0%
they would not be allowed
 
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:11.030 align:start position:0%
so that's probably the reason why we're
 
00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:12.230 align:start position:0%
hearing from some of these restaurants
 
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.110 align:start position:0%
that they want this going forward
 
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:16.700 align:start position:0%
exactly and as was mentioned before is
 
00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:19.220 align:start position:0%
is it certainly is this program would
 
00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:22.490 align:start position:0%
provide an assurance program assurance
 
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:24.130 align:start position:0%
to the restaurant that they were getting
 
00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:28.580 align:start position:0%
a product from someone deemed an expert
 
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:31.550 align:start position:0%
and you know they wouldn't be passing on
 
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:33.980 align:start position:0%
some subsequent risk to their patrons of
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
having a misidentified mushroom that
 
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:40.990 align:start position:0%
could cause illness thank you
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
and further questions representative
 
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:46.180 align:start position:0%
fellowes has her hand up
 
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:49.790 align:start position:0%
represented fellows thank you just as a
 
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.050 align:start position:0%
follow-up to two of the earlier comments
 
00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:57.940 align:start position:0%
on the first page of the bill on line 16
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's an identification of the tier 1
 
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:03.740 align:start position:0%
mushrooms and those are only mushrooms
 
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:07.810 align:start position:0%
that are easily identified and have no
 
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:10.190 align:start position:0%
look-alikes and so the committee won't
 
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:13.810 align:start position:0%
as we discuss this we discussed the
 
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:16.820 align:start position:0%
mushrooms we thought would likely be put
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
on this list and there's only about 10
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
of them and they're really I can assure
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
you that there's no danger in any of
 
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:29.980 align:start position:0%
those mushrooms and in terms of the
 
00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:33.470 align:start position:0%
restaurants being able to know what it
 
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:35.540 align:start position:0%
is that they're buying part of the bill
 
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:38.210 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which section it is but it
 
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:40.220 align:start position:0%
requires Health and Human Services to
 
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:42.740 align:start position:0%
provide information to the restaurants
 
00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.650 align:start position:0%
provide information to the restaurants
or

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:43.660 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
establishments and with pictures so that
 
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
you could be able to identify the
 
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:53.510 align:start position:0%
mushrooms that that come to them by a
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
harvester and the third thing I'd like
 
00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:58.750 align:start position:0%
to do is just to get absolutely
 
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:02.990 align:start position:0%
clarity from Colleen Smith about the
 
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:05.930 align:start position:0%
ability of the department to
 
00:39:09.339 --> 00:39:09.349 align:start position:0%
implement the provisions of this statute
 
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:14.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
effective date is January 1st
 
00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:22.069 align:start position:0%
21 given the situation we're in right
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
now are you still confident that the
 
00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:26.809 align:start position:0%
Department will be able to do that thank
 
00:39:26.809 --> 00:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
Department will be able to do that thank
you

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:28.809 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:37.819 align:start position:0%
am I am i unmuted yes perfect Thanks so
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
I I certainly
 
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:44.300 align:start position:0%
as as things have evolved over the last
 
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.130 align:start position:0%
few months this would definitely be a
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
challenge and you know certainly we are
 
00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:51.109 align:start position:0%
relying again collaboratively to work
 
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:54.410 align:start position:0%
with UNH and also agriculture on
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
developing this curriculum there that
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
depending on when this bill ultimately
 
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:03.650 align:start position:0%
would get passed into law it there might
 
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:05.270 align:start position:0%
be some challenges with meeting that
 
00:40:09.819 --> 00:40:09.829 align:start position:0%
January 1st deadline I would if we could
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
have at least another six months I would
 
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:14.390 align:start position:0%
say that given the the current state and
 
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:16.670 align:start position:0%
other issues that we are dealing with
 
00:40:18.609 --> 00:40:18.619 align:start position:0%
right now it would give us definitely
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
some a little bit more flexibility and
 
00:40:22.839 --> 00:40:22.849 align:start position:0%
and also giving us time to do due
 
00:40:25.059 --> 00:40:25.069 align:start position:0%
diligence and in working with those
 
00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:39.369 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.609 --> 00:40:41.619 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:44.210 align:start position:0%
just answered the question but to
 
00:40:47.549 --> 00:40:47.559 align:start position:0%
calling Smith in the section on the
 
00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:49.970 align:start position:0%
amendment duties Department of Health
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:55.270 align:start position:0%
Roman 1 and 2 paragraphs 1 &amp; 2 mentioned
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to know if that meant
 
00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to know if that meant
pictures

00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:00.369 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.010 align:start position:0%
yeah idea would be yes to provide photos
 
00:41:06.059 --> 00:41:06.069 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:07.890 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
and

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:07.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:10.869 align:start position:0%
representative Bowden has his hand up
 
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:14.450 align:start position:0%
represent Bowden thank you just wanna we
 
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:16.670 align:start position:0%
revisit the fine schedule and this
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
question is for one of the three members
 
00:41:22.339 --> 00:41:22.349 align:start position:0%
of each committee if the DHA just came
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
back to the gel car pardon while they're
 
00:41:28.549 --> 00:41:28.559 align:start position:0%
entering rulemaking and gel car felt
 
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
that they're fine schedule was excessive
 
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.010 align:start position:0%
with Jack I have the authority to
 
00:41:36.859 --> 00:41:36.869 align:start position:0%
amend that fine schedule or does it
 
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:39.500 align:start position:0%
require legislative activities
 
00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:42.109 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire
 
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.170 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:57.290 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:01.230 align:start position:0%
ever they wanted there you go could you
 
00:42:02.839 --> 00:42:02.849 align:start position:0%
repeat that representing acquire you
 
00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:05.990 align:start position:0%
froze on us oh sorry
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
gel car could object if they thought it
 
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:13.470 align:start position:0%
was not in the public interest but my
 
00:42:16.089 --> 00:42:16.099 align:start position:0%
feeling is it would have to be grossly
 
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:19.170 align:start position:0%
exorbitant you know a thousand dollars a
 
00:42:21.859 --> 00:42:21.869 align:start position:0%
day for poor record-keeping or whatever
 
00:42:25.539 --> 00:42:25.549 align:start position:0%
for us to feel that we had a
 
00:42:28.789 --> 00:42:28.799 align:start position:0%
leg to stand on because this bill gives
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
them full authority I would say that
 
00:42:33.559 --> 00:42:33.569 align:start position:0%
we're going to amend the bill anyway we
 
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:36.510 align:start position:0%
should put in a maximum fine at the very
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
should put in a maximum fine at the very
least

00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:37.369 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:42:41.539 --> 00:42:41.549 align:start position:0%
and I agree with them we don't just want
 
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:46.130 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mister chairman representative
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
SciTech would like to ask a question
 
00:42:54.289 --> 00:42:54.299 align:start position:0%
he's not showing up on our list but I'm
 
00:42:57.039 --> 00:42:57.049 align:start position:0%
going to recognize him if it's all right
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
represent a psychic yeah I have I have a
 
00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:03.569 align:start position:0%
few things does food establishment mean
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
miss Smith's alone yes we're gonna see
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
if we can get an answer for you miss it
 
00:43:16.359 --> 00:43:16.369 align:start position:0%
yes it does include
 
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.010 align:start position:0%
include restaurants retail stores anyone
 
00:43:22.329 --> 00:43:22.339 align:start position:0%
offering food to the public
 
00:43:22.339 --> 00:43:24.020 align:start position:0%
offering food to the public
okay

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:24.030 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
a couple other things first I heard the
 
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:29.250 align:start position:0%
word guarantee used early in this
 
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:32.490 align:start position:0%
discussion and I think that's a little
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
ever stated just to keep our feet on the
 
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:40.890 align:start position:0%
ground here I the given that the F we
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
have a subscribed to the FDA's code
 
00:43:47.359 --> 00:43:47.369 align:start position:0%
there seems to be little choice and this
 
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
work session is oozing its way into an
 
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:52.340 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:55.470 align:start position:0%
we really were going to talk about the
 
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:57.270 align:start position:0%
amendment but since it's turned into a
 
00:43:59.240 --> 00:43:59.250 align:start position:0%
bit of a free-for-all I'm going to
 
00:44:00.859 --> 00:44:00.869 align:start position:0%
mention a couple things that I didn't
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
that concern me technically about the
 
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:07.550 align:start position:0%
bill first is it licenses distributors
 
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:09.860 align:start position:0%
identifier and
 
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
harvesters I don't know why a
 
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:14.970 align:start position:0%
distributor has to be licensed if he's
 
00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:18.020 align:start position:0%
gotten it from a licensed harvester
 
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
distributor Geiger I just don't see that
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
the role of an identifier is it is it's
 
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:28.890 align:start position:0%
he's licensed but I don't see that that
 
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
has any that the identifier has any part
 
00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
it plays any role in the process the
 
00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
mushrooms that is that he has passed the
 
00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:47.609 align:start position:0%
tier to tier one exam for we trust that
 
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
we have a higher level of assurance the
 
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:51.930 align:start position:0%
distributor gets it I don't know what
 
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:52.780 align:start position:0%
distributor gets it I don't know what
the

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
identifier is going to do so my my
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
concerns are that this is not
 
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:00.930 align:start position:0%
technically you've done very well I
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any big harm given
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
30 people blah blah blah so I think the
 
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:09.930 align:start position:0%
FDA is sort of going to even though mr.
 
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:11.850 align:start position:0%
chair you don't want to hear this that
 
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:13.530 align:start position:0%
it's not an executive session what
 
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
choice do we have
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
anyways that's all I really wanted to
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
say thank you Miss Smith do you have a
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
response to them why the distributor
 
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:26.330 align:start position:0%
needs to be licensed
 
00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:29.730 align:start position:0%
so these two are terms that were were
 
00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:33.390 align:start position:0%
vetted pretty extensively in our study
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
commissioned work because the the idea
 
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:40.050 align:start position:0%
is that in some cases the distributor
 
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:42.500 align:start position:0%
has has
 
00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:44.820 align:start position:0%
their you have nothing to do with the
 
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:47.610 align:start position:0%
downstream process yet they're the the
 
00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:49.770 align:start position:0%
actual one that takes the responsibility
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
and providing them to to the restaurant
 
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:55.230 align:start position:0%
so they might not have been actually the
 
00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:58.170 align:start position:0%
one to harvest the mushrooms or identify
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
the mushrooms but they're the one
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
they're the entity that's actually the
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
direct contact with the restaurant
 
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
direct contact with the restaurant
itself

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
and mr. chairman just so you know
 
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:13.650 align:start position:0%
representative Connor and representative
 
00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
Bixby are both in the attendee list with
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
their hands up but we also have
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Pimentel next from the
 
00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:25.650 align:start position:0%
committee members okay and and this I
 
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
guess one last question going to Miss
 
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:29.690 align:start position:0%
Smith would this be
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
requiring a distributor because
 
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:33.510 align:start position:0%
mushrooms may come from another state
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a licensing process to
 
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:37.650 align:start position:0%
allow them to be moved on to our
 
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.340 align:start position:0%
allow them to be moved on to our
restaurants

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:39.350 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:42.750 align:start position:0%
that could be an instance as well so
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
that was another reason to be inclusive
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
of both of all three identifiers as
 
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:58.190 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:02.060 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chairman just
 
00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:05.390 align:start position:0%
the fact that the January first
 
00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
date of implementation seems to be
 
00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:09.500 align:start position:0%
problematic just
 
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
changing it to
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
six months or after the bill is signed
 
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:20.810 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:24.750 align:start position:0%
okay we'll think about it and see if we
 
00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:26.550 align:start position:0%
can get it may be an amendment drafted
 
00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:28.190 align:start position:0%
changing that
 
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:31.460 align:start position:0%
and any other committee members
 
00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:35.550 align:start position:0%
prove with the question represent
 
00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:38.190 align:start position:0%
approval so I noticed in the amendment
 
00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
on line 16 it says Department do
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
not exceed $2 for each violation so that
 
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's something already in there I
 
00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
know I'm a little blagging behind in
 
00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:52.890 align:start position:0%
this conversation but thank you for
 
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:56.450 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:58.970 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has his hand up
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has his hand up
we're

00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:01.249 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:48:05.359 --> 00:48:05.369 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like also to speak on the
 
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:08.630 align:start position:0%
subject of represent Boden's question
 
00:48:10.939 --> 00:48:10.949 align:start position:0%
members have to understand that the gel
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
car process is not a take-it-or-leave-it
 
00:48:15.769 --> 00:48:15.779 align:start position:0%
that the public is involved as a right
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
to be involved in the establishment of
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
rules and and they do participate and
 
00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:26.670 align:start position:0%
the objections that they raise if they
 
00:48:29.059 --> 00:48:29.069 align:start position:0%
are not sufficiently addressed in the
 
00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:33.150 align:start position:0%
process they can be raised again in the
 
00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:35.670 align:start position:0%
gel car hearing which is also a public
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
hearing and one of the questions I
 
00:48:41.299 --> 00:48:41.309 align:start position:0%
always ask if somebody in the public eye
 
00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:43.589 align:start position:0%
you know appears in opposition to
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
something whether this was something
 
00:48:49.759 --> 00:48:49.769 align:start position:0%
that was addressed by them in the you
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
know in that development of the rules of
 
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:55.410 align:start position:0%
process and that is something that the
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
gel car frequently checks to so it's not
 
00:49:03.249 --> 00:49:03.259 align:start position:0%
a take-it-or-leave-it situation as one
 
00:49:06.859 --> 00:49:06.869 align:start position:0%
without the necessary experience and all
 
00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:10.890 align:start position:0%
this might assume from remarks that were
 
00:49:14.059 --> 00:49:14.069 align:start position:0%
made previously this is an engagement
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
back and forth to develop the best rules
 
00:49:20.179 --> 00:49:20.189 align:start position:0%
possible but the gel car is the final
 
00:49:23.749 --> 00:49:23.759 align:start position:0%
say on this so I think that that we are
 
00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:28.709 align:start position:0%
not inviting the the purveyors to abuse
 
00:49:31.759 --> 00:49:31.769 align:start position:0%
the system by the by the amendment that
 
00:49:38.229 --> 00:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.669 --> 00:49:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.929 --> 00:49:46.939 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chair I was looking at the
 
00:49:50.209 --> 00:49:50.219 align:start position:0%
food rules that represent of connect
 
00:49:53.179 --> 00:49:53.189 align:start position:0%
very kindly sent me and it appears that
 
00:49:56.839 --> 00:49:56.849 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't comply with them it
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
requires the food establishment to be
 
00:50:03.189 --> 00:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
approved it doesn't say anything about
 
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:06.890 align:start position:0%
only buying from approved suppliers
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't address the issue that it's
 
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:16.460 align:start position:0%
trying to solve
 
00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:19.230 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned that it appears to be
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
setting up three identical licenses with
 
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:23.900 align:start position:0%
different names and
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
how do we know who's an identifier and
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
who's who's a distributor and why do we
 
00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.470 align:start position:0%
who's who's a distributor and why do we
care

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
Miss Smith would you like to address the
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
FDA rules and why this is a requirement
 
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.590 align:start position:0%
FDA rules and why this is a requirement
so

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:45.510 align:start position:0%
within the food the food code are the
 
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:47.970 align:start position:0%
standards for our regulation of food
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
establishments which include restaurants
 
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:54.690 align:start position:0%
retail stores so one of the one of one
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the elements of the food code is that
 
00:50:58.610 --> 00:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
all food comes from an approved source
 
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
and the food code is is very specific to
 
00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
certain commodities whether it be eggs
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
whether it be meat whether it be produce
 
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:08.790 align:start position:0%
what constitutes in an approved source
 
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:12.090 align:start position:0%
wild mushrooms are are very specifically
 
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:14.370 align:start position:0%
delineated as the criteria for their
 
00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
approval and so to be deemed an approved
 
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:19.890 align:start position:0%
source and to be allowable to be used at
 
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:22.950 align:start position:0%
a licensed food establishment the
 
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:24.990 align:start position:0%
criteria set forth in the food code is
 
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:28.590 align:start position:0%
that the supplier be approved through
 
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:31.830 align:start position:0%
through a state program and it gives
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations as to the elements of
 
00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:36.410 align:start position:0%
that program that the person is trained
 
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:39.570 align:start position:0%
and recognized in being able to solidly
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
identify mushrooms that are safe for
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
consumption correctly so so certainly we
 
00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:47.750 align:start position:0%
we have had many
 
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:50.550 align:start position:0%
wild mushroom harvesters come to us over
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
the years who want to be approved to
 
00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
provide their products that they harvest
 
00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:58.350 align:start position:0%
to be their grocery stores or
 
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:00.330 align:start position:0%
restaurants and we simply don't have an
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
approval process for them so we've told
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
them we've told them no you know so we
 
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
did try on an ad hoc basis probably
 
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:10.410 align:start position:0%
about five years ago where we had
 
00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:13.490 align:start position:0%
members from agriculture and
 
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:16.650 align:start position:0%
dr. van der polis represent of connect
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
had mentioned before who had a vetted
 
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
interest in trying to stand something up
 
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.050 align:start position:0%
in the state as as our own workgroup we
 
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:27.390 align:start position:0%
didn't have we couldn't pull it gather
 
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
because there were a lot of issues
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
around licensing around land landowner
 
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.050 align:start position:0%
trespassing and where these are
 
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:37.450 align:start position:0%
harvested it was a bigger project than
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we felt we could do without some
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and rulemaking to go along
 
00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:45.910 align:start position:0%
with it and certainly that's what
 
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:48.730 align:start position:0%
historically prompted the the idea of
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
the study commission to study all the
 
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:52.690 align:start position:0%
issues around this and then the
 
00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:56.230 align:start position:0%
subsequent legislation this this this
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
session to put that into place
 
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:03.310 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of a long answer but but
 
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:05.250 align:start position:0%
that if you know certainly happy to
 
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:07.950 align:start position:0%
respond to any follow-up questions
 
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:18.310 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to respond to an
 
00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:21.100 align:start position:0%
earlier question or a clarification that
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
it's not the intent for there to be
 
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:26.770 align:start position:0%
three different licenses for harvesters
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
distributors and identifiers the intent
 
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:33.090 align:start position:0%
is to have one license the same
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
educational requirements for all three
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
of those activities would be two
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
different licenses but that just has to
 
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:43.900 align:start position:0%
do with if it's for the Tier one like
 
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:47.500 align:start position:0%
the ten mushrooms to identify in Tier
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:56.410 align:start position:0%
and representative McGuire has your hand
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
up represent McGuire yes Thank You mr.
 
00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
up represent McGuire yes Thank You mr.
chair

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:01.050 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:09.090 align:start position:0%
approval I appreciate that the
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
rules require an approved source for
 
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.030 align:start position:0%
food however the rule specifically says
 
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:18.370 align:start position:0%
mushroom species picked in the wild
 
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:21.010 align:start position:0%
shall not be offered for sale unless the
 
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
food establishment has been approved to
 
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
do so so I think we either need to
 
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:30.250 align:start position:0%
modify that or we need we we need to do
 
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:32.140 align:start position:0%
something about that because it doesn't
 
00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
have an exemption for
 
00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:38.490 align:start position:0%
mushrooms picked by an approved
 
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:40.270 align:start position:0%
mushrooms picked by an approved
identifier

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
identifier
 
00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:41.750 align:start position:0%
I think if we're all I go and have one
 
00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:43.790 align:start position:0%
license we shouldn't we should just say
 
00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:45.830 align:start position:0%
one thing I think identifier as the
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
right title
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
but that's it that's a myth
 
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.630 align:start position:0%
but that's it that's a myth

mr. chairman we've got representative

Turner who has his hand up and also
 
00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:00.830 align:start position:0%
representative dick speak from the
 
00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.130 align:start position:0%
representative dick speak from the
audience

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:02.140 align:start position:0%
audience
 
00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:05.810 align:start position:0%
I will recognize representative Bixby
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
first sure
 
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.610 align:start position:0%
first sure
okay

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:11.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
Bixby hello thank you for taking my
 
00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
Bixby hello thank you for taking my
question

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:15.970 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:19.490 align:start position:0%
so I was looking at page 1 of the bill
 
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:21.490 align:start position:0%
under penalty and
 
00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:25.820 align:start position:0%
it looks like the for all the possible
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
violations there is a maximum of fine of
 
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:33.340 align:start position:0%
it says not to exceed 1000 and my under
 
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:36.530 align:start position:0%
protection of Hawaiian on page 2 that
 
00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:38.660 align:start position:0%
gives the department rulemaking
 
00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
authority is that that would be in order
 
00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
to make those under 1000 dollar fines
 
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:50.390 align:start position:0%
that is correct that's as discussed
 
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
previously that is I think that so that
 
00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:55.730 align:start position:0%
will be taken at the Joker will not
 
00:55:59.220 --> 00:55:59.230 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:01.810 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:04.790 align:start position:0%
and further comment representative
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
Connor had his hand up before represent
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
Connor you're recognized thank you very
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
much I have I've been making a little
 
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:15.530 align:start position:0%
list to go over first let me go over
 
00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:17.090 align:start position:0%
that issue about the food establishment
 
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:18.310 align:start position:0%
approval I
 
00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
think what Colleen Smith was pointing
 
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:23.630 align:start position:0%
out is the food establishment gains
 
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:27.380 align:start position:0%
their approval by their proper sourcing
 
00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:29.660 align:start position:0%
records that's their approval to sell a
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
wild mushroom is the fact that they have
 
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:33.830 align:start position:0%
a sourcing record that this came from an
 
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:36.350 align:start position:0%
approved harvester or distributor so
 
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:38.030 align:start position:0%
that they know that it is safe that's
 
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:40.310 align:start position:0%
why they have to keep that record and
 
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:43.130 align:start position:0%
that is the the whole genesis of this so
 
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:45.470 align:start position:0%
it is not really a matter of approving
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
them it's a matter of approving this
 
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:50.510 align:start position:0%
sources and that's what Colleen Smith
 
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:53.060 align:start position:0%
was saying if the inspector from food
 
00:56:55.319 --> 00:56:55.329 align:start position:0%
protection goes there's no source record
 
00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:57.730 align:start position:0%
then that is not approved they are not
 
00:56:59.370 --> 00:56:59.380 align:start position:0%
approved to sell that that's how they
 
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:02.490 align:start position:0%
gain their approval sir okay
 
00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:04.900 align:start position:0%
the fine schedule yes the maximum is
 
00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:07.630 align:start position:0%
that really both for the person who
 
00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:09.550 align:start position:0%
either to harvest identify or distribute
 
00:57:12.089 --> 00:57:12.099 align:start position:0%
without a license and also for a food
 
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:14.260 align:start position:0%
establishment serving and each of those
 
00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
are $1000 maximum so those are set now
 
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:19.570 align:start position:0%
the goal of this actually is for the
 
00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:21.609 align:start position:0%
restaurant to not necessarily have to
 
00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
actually identify they would be provided
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
information and pictures but they would
 
00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:27.609 align:start position:0%
not have to because they would have a
 
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:30.940 align:start position:0%
reliable source who is certified to sell
 
00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:33.730 align:start position:0%
it to them however that is why one of
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
the major reasons we allowed this
 
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:38.050 align:start position:0%
subgroup of identifier z' that's what an
 
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:41.290 align:start position:0%
identifier might be a restaurant may
 
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
have someone in their staff who is
 
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:46.150 align:start position:0%
licensed as an identifier so they can
 
00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:48.430 align:start position:0%
double check the mushrooms which are
 
00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:50.950 align:start position:0%
being provided to them that's a choice
 
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
that they might have
 
00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:54.820 align:start position:0%
it was also stated I think fairly
 
00:57:56.579 --> 00:57:56.589 align:start position:0%
clearly that the issue is some
 
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:58.510 align:start position:0%
distributors might have some harvesters
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
working for them who just do a very
 
00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
small amount and that's why if they're
 
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:03.910 align:start position:0%
still going to be the one who sells it
 
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:05.500 align:start position:0%
they're the one who has to hold the
 
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.730 align:start position:0%
they're the one who has to hold the
license

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
so and the last thing was the timing a
 
00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:13.150 align:start position:0%
lot of the framework for the educational
 
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:14.710 align:start position:0%
course actually has already done I think
 
00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:16.780 align:start position:0%
it will be appropriate to push it out to
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
six months after the bill is passed
 
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:22.450 align:start position:0%
because we don't know how fast thing is
 
00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:25.630 align:start position:0%
going to go but the framework for the
 
00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:27.730 align:start position:0%
course has already been developed
 
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:30.730 align:start position:0%
primarily by dr. van de poele and there
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
is an in similar
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
course being taught by dr. Neath is down
 
00:58:37.079 --> 00:58:37.089 align:start position:0%
at UNH so we don't really have to start
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
from scratch on the courses they partly
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
exist or they just have to fine-tune how
 
00:58:44.609 --> 00:58:44.619 align:start position:0%
they're going to be done thank you thank
 
00:58:44.619 --> 00:58:45.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to be done thank you thank
you

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:45.390 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:49.810 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions I don't
 
00:58:51.809 --> 00:58:51.819 align:start position:0%
see any other hands up mr. chairman but
 
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:54.010 align:start position:0%
I see representative Pierson has joined
 
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:01.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
all right if there's no further question
 
00:59:05.559 --> 00:59:05.569 align:start position:0%
so we're going to move on to the next
 
00:59:10.499 --> 00:59:10.509 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
which is House bill 1710
 
00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
which is House bill 1710
[Applause]

00:59:18.479 --> 00:59:18.489 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:21.470 align:start position:0%
relative disclosure of results of child
 
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:23.890 align:start position:0%
daycare monitoring visits
 
00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:30.220 align:start position:0%
any questions or concerns or comments
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
on House bill 1710
 
00:59:37.049 --> 00:59:37.059 align:start position:0%
that the committee has I
 
00:59:40.809 --> 00:59:40.819 align:start position:0%
don't see any hands give a few more
 
00:59:42.849 --> 00:59:42.859 align:start position:0%
minutes for folks to look over and
 
00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:53.499 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:57.410 align:start position:0%
do see a hand from child guidance out in
 
00:59:59.979 --> 00:59:59.989 align:start position:0%
the attendee list if you want a food
 
01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:02.900 align:start position:0%
comment I'm not going to take public
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
comment at this time this is some kind
 
01:00:14.609 --> 01:00:14.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.049 --> 01:00:17.059 align:start position:0%
think this is one of the topics we've
 
01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:19.630 align:start position:0%
discussed previously in some of our
 
01:00:22.049 --> 01:00:22.059 align:start position:0%
hearings on
 
01:00:24.599 --> 01:00:24.609 align:start position:0%
findings during
 
01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:27.380 align:start position:0%
investigations and this is just moving
 
01:00:28.839 --> 01:00:28.849 align:start position:0%
us a little forward in the right
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:31.769 align:start position:0%
us a little forward in the right
direction

01:00:31.769 --> 01:00:31.779 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:34.690 align:start position:0%
so if there is no other
 
01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:37.229 align:start position:0%
so if there is no other
comments

01:00:37.229 --> 01:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:00:41.319 --> 01:00:41.329 align:start position:0%
no hands in view well represent approve
 
01:00:45.569 --> 01:00:45.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.579 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
prove

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:47.890 align:start position:0%
prove
 
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:51.650 align:start position:0%
muted so I guess my question is I know
 
01:00:55.769 --> 01:00:55.779 align:start position:0%
we extended the day's out 15 for
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
them to have time to respond now if
 
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:03.140 align:start position:0%
they're asking for a hearing does that
 
01:01:10.559 --> 01:01:10.569 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's someone here from
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
licensing or daycares yes Melissa
 
01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:19.700 align:start position:0%
Clement is out in the audience and she
 
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:21.610 align:start position:0%
has her hand up
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
miss Clement could you help us with that
 
01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:27.910 align:start position:0%
good morning mr. chair and the committee
 
01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:33.730 align:start position:0%
so the process for posting online
 
01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
is separate from the process of when
 
01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:38.660 align:start position:0%
they are asked for an informal dispute
 
01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:41.270 align:start position:0%
resolution so if they ask for an
 
01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:43.580 align:start position:0%
informal dispute resolution they have
 
01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:45.580 align:start position:0%
different timelines in order to do that
 
01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in the statute here
 
01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:52.430 align:start position:0%
that discusses what happens when they
 
01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:54.140 align:start position:0%
have an informal dispute resolution
 
01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
versus when we post the inspections
 
01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:57.620 align:start position:0%
online that's not addressing on
 
01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.850 align:start position:0%
online that's not addressing on
legislation

01:01:59.850 --> 01:01:59.860 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
there would be separate legislation if
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
we did that correct this isn't
 
01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:08.570 align:start position:0%
yes there's a separate statute regarding
 
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:10.810 align:start position:0%
the informal dispute resolution process
 
01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:14.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:20.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:25.070 align:start position:0%
complaint against them but they resolve
 
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get resolved but now they
 
01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:29.540 align:start position:0%
want to hearing that it gets posted
 
01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:33.860 align:start position:0%
until those all resolved right so until
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
they exhausted all measures
 
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:38.570 align:start position:0%
be posed because they could come out
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
that they weren't wrong but it's now
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
been posted that they were wrong and
 
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
been posted that they were wrong and
were

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:45.730 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.550 --> 01:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:03.190 align:start position:0%
yeah so the way it works now is if
 
01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:06.580 align:start position:0%
someone responds and they have they wish
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
to dispute their findings we post that
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
information online as well so
 
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:14.950 align:start position:0%
we would follow the timelines a Centon
 
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:19.060 align:start position:0%
statute if we have a dispute that goes
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
beyond that is requested as required we
 
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:23.770 align:start position:0%
would put their dispute online as well
 
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:25.450 align:start position:0%
it would be clearly indicated that the
 
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
findings were
 
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
being disputed that's our process now
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
and we would continue with that process
 
01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Fox has a hand up
 
01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:44.740 align:start position:0%
represent Fox thank you I just wanted to
 
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.030 align:start position:0%
comment I was on the study committee
 
01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:49.180 align:start position:0%
that participated this this bill being
 
01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
brought forward and
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
it was sorry it was a request at the
 
01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:56.130 align:start position:0%
request of take care operators who have
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
microfauna to prove had damage done by
 
01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:06.690 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.099 --> 01:04:10.109 align:start position:0%
so that kids can go to daycare
 
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:15.339 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Schmidt
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
has a hand up represents MIT
 
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:21.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr. chair well as a
 
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:24.730 align:start position:0%
member of the jell car I certainly have
 
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:26.730 align:start position:0%
been a witness to
 
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
disputes involving daycare providers
 
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
appearing before the jello car with
 
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
concerns and I think this is one of the
 
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:38.650 align:start position:0%
issues that has been most contentious is
 
01:04:41.579 --> 01:04:41.589 align:start position:0%
the idea that something that is brought
 
01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
to their attention
 
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:47.050 align:start position:0%
by to the attention of the Department
 
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:48.970 align:start position:0%
they come in they investigate and so
 
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
forth and that something can be posted
 
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:54.790 align:start position:0%
before the issue is resolved and of
 
01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
course this to the degree that it's a
 
01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:01.570 align:start position:0%
legitimate can get amid finding and
 
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:05.710 align:start position:0%
something needs to be you know fixed or
 
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:07.830 align:start position:0%
stopped whatever the particular
 
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:11.890 align:start position:0%
violation might be or no any finding
 
01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:14.980 align:start position:0%
that is potentially harmful to the to
 
01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
the public and especially to young
 
01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.020 align:start position:0%
the public and especially to young
children

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:18.030 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
but but to the degree that the
 
01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
Department the scene is judge jury and
 
01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:28.780 align:start position:0%
executioner as well is something that
 
01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:33.100 align:start position:0%
that troubles many of us who have dealt
 
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:36.490 align:start position:0%
with this situation and and so I think
 
01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
we have to I think we have to be very
 
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:42.970 align:start position:0%
mindful of the fact that that and
 
01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
operations reputation is on the line
 
01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
when they are accused of something
 
01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:49.810 align:start position:0%
obviously for something that is clearly
 
01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:53.380 align:start position:0%
a violation clearly a harmful to the
 
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
public health that the department has
 
01:05:59.970 --> 01:05:59.980 align:start position:0%
authority to act in those situations act
 
01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:02.950 align:start position:0%
immediately but there there are much
 
01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
lesser findings in some cases which
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
still can be harmful to
 
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:11.500 align:start position:0%
child care entities ability to still
 
01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
attract the public so I think we have to
 
01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:15.930 align:start position:0%
be very careful about
 
01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:19.660 align:start position:0%
allowing information to be posted until
 
01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:22.210 align:start position:0%
it has been resolved along the lines of
 
01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:23.950 align:start position:0%
what represented proofs at a moment ago
 
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:25.990 align:start position:0%
so I think we have to be very careful
 
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:30.810 align:start position:0%
before we allow the department to
 
01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:34.150 align:start position:0%
and we have seen situations where people
 
01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:37.810 align:start position:0%
were where inspectors were accused of
 
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:40.510 align:start position:0%
being heavy handed or retaliatory and so
 
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.010 align:start position:0%
forth and so on this is an area where we
 
01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:47.230 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful that we do not
 
01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
allow you know overreach to occur
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
where a matter has not been resolved
 
01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:00.370 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
another Brodeur has a hand up thank you
 
01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:09.690 align:start position:0%
thank you mr. chair so I've read this
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
bill as intent to bring more
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
transparency to the process
 
01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:18.430 align:start position:0%
and I would like to know from the
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:24.250 align:start position:0%
the difference is between what they do
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
know and what's what this bill
 
01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:29.810 align:start position:0%
know and what's what this bill
involves

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
involves
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
if the administrator
 
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:36.310 align:start position:0%
yes thank you well what this film will
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
be doing is providing additional time
 
01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:40.470 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:43.300 align:start position:0%
providers to be able to have their
 
01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:46.180 align:start position:0%
findings sent to them and then reviewed
 
01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
and provide their response prior to us
 
01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:50.590 align:start position:0%
posting it online currently what happens
 
01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:54.070 align:start position:0%
is we based on the previous statute is
 
01:07:55.859 --> 01:07:55.869 align:start position:0%
we would send the providers their
 
01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:57.930 align:start position:0%
findings and then within five days
 
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
business days of those findings being
 
01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:03.460 align:start position:0%
sent to the program they would then be
 
01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:06.340 align:start position:0%
posted online before the providers would
 
01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
have to provide their corrective action
 
01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:10.350 align:start position:0%
plan or give a
 
01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:12.850 align:start position:0%
asked for them to be disputed because
 
01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:15.910 align:start position:0%
currently they have 14 days to send us a
 
01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:17.500 align:start position:0%
request to dispute the findings that
 
01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:20.380 align:start position:0%
were sent to them so this process allows
 
01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:22.810 align:start position:0%
the findings not to be made public
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
before the 15 days
 
01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:31.060 align:start position:0%
and it allows them more time to provide
 
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:32.770 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan or to dispute
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
so it would delay it being put on a mine
 
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
for a longer
 
01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:39.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.559 --> 01:08:48.569 align:start position:0%
she does not any other questions
 
01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:50.430 align:start position:0%
or comments
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
we just got um look Melissa Clement has
 
01:08:59.160 --> 01:08:59.170 align:start position:0%
one more thing to say this clinic or I
 
01:09:01.079 --> 01:09:01.089 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make the committee aware
 
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:03.750 align:start position:0%
that there is a study committee that has
 
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:08.170 align:start position:0%
been asked for to review our informal
 
01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:09.940 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process which will be
 
01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:13.180 align:start position:0%
occurring late and once the legislation
 
01:09:15.059 --> 01:09:15.069 align:start position:0%
is passed this year so that whole
 
01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:19.420 align:start position:0%
process will be reviewed and revised
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
potentially next session so this is a
 
01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
post this is these statutes are with
 
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:28.930 align:start position:0%
addresses when we post information and
 
01:09:30.570 --> 01:09:30.580 align:start position:0%
then we're going to be awful looking at
 
01:09:34.079 --> 01:09:34.089 align:start position:0%
our whole IDR process
 
01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:35.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and I believe that was House
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative Peru has a hand up where
 
01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:47.350 align:start position:0%
was that proof so again I'm just gonna
 
01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
reiterate I really don't like things
 
01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:51.310 align:start position:0%
being posted until their final and I
 
01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:52.810 align:start position:0%
think we should correct that and I'm
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
glad that you know we're doing that
 
01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:56.980 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that whole process
 
01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:58.530 align:start position:0%
because I keep it
 
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:00.930 align:start position:0%
fairly flawed
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
but I have a lot of problems with
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
posting people are in that process
 
01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:09.370 align:start position:0%
haven't had time to resolve it and until
 
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:16.630 align:start position:0%
and I agree but I think what we have
 
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:19.210 align:start position:0%
before us is better than what we have
 
01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:20.740 align:start position:0%
currently and it's a move in the right
 
01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:22.270 align:start position:0%
direction until we get the study
 
01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
committee to do their work and come back
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:30.670 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions we have
 
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:32.890 align:start position:0%
represented merchants has his hand up
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay and just a reminder we are not an
 
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:38.410 align:start position:0%
executive session if we want to dispute
 
01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:40.990 align:start position:0%
or talk about why we should have another
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
why we shouldn't have the bill if he
 
01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:44.380 align:start position:0%
could hold off at the week second this
 
01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:46.350 align:start position:0%
is for questions you may have for
 
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:50.710 align:start position:0%
mr. Clement or the sponsor representing
 
01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:53.500 align:start position:0%
Archer Thank You mr. chair this question
 
01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:55.780 align:start position:0%
is from miss Clement I looked into the
 
01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:00.580 align:start position:0%
line 9 it appears to be that any
 
01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.130 align:start position:0%
findings by the department remain on the
 
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:05.530 align:start position:0%
website for three years going back to
 
01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:08.620 align:start position:0%
represent a cruise point if something is
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
found to be not valid or overturned does
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
that mean it still stays on the website
 
01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
for three years or does it come down
 
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:20.620 align:start position:0%
it comes down the minute that we the
 
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:23.050 align:start position:0%
informal dispute resolution process we
 
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
address that by we have a meeting or
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
they present information in writing to
 
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
us we then reevaluate the findings we
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
make any changes to what we call the
 
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
statement of findings which is what's
 
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:35.830 align:start position:0%
posted online and the only thing that is
 
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:38.500 align:start position:0%
public is what is then revised as a
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
result of that informal dispute
 
01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.439 --> 01:11:48.449 align:start position:0%
any further comments or questions
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
before we go
 
01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:55.110 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to close the work
 
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:00.940 align:start position:0%
session on these two bills and we will
 
01:12:10.129 --> 01:12:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
once again I will have to read the
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
script seeing where you're starting a
 
01:12:15.259 --> 01:12:15.269 align:start position:0%
new meeting
 
01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:18.130 align:start position:0%
and we will have to do a roll one more
 
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:20.530 align:start position:0%
time going into the executive session
 
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:23.610 align:start position:0%
for those that are with us
 
01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:25.750 align:start position:0%
as chair of the house executive
 
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:27.340 align:start position:0%
departments and administration committee
 
01:12:29.009 --> 01:12:29.019 align:start position:0%
I find that due to the state of
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
emergency declared by the governor as a
 
01:12:33.299 --> 01:12:33.309 align:start position:0%

01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%

okay I just I just wanted to state that
 
01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
we did have the work session on February
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
5th and during that work session it was
 
01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:47.380 align:start position:0%
deemed that
 
01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:50.380 align:start position:0%
as amended this bill

bill were taken out when it was amended
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
it was a very brief executive session
 
01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:02.990 align:start position:0%
brief work session for that fact of
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
brief work session for that fact of
being

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:04.750 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:08.030 align:start position:0%
recognized represent both Thank You mr.
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I probably will support this
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill I don't really have much of a
 
01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
problem with it but I do want to point
 
01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:16.190 align:start position:0%
out the Department of Health and Human
 
01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:18.740 align:start position:0%
Services has stated that the bill is not
 
01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:21.890 align:start position:0%
expected to have a fiscal impact if you
 
01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:23.810 align:start position:0%
are to read the safe-haven guidelines
 
01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:26.930 align:start position:0%
they're quite extensive and in for some
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
at least some facilities could pose a
 
01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:33.950 align:start position:0%
substantial fiscal cost and that's
 
01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:35.300 align:start position:0%
it's going to be filtered down to the
 
01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities and agencies that have to
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
fund those centers so you know I just
 
01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
have a problem with this repeatedly
 
01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:45.470 align:start position:0%
happening on bills that we either have
 
01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact or it's indeterminate
 
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:50.510 align:start position:0%
when in fact they can in fact be very
 
01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:52.580 align:start position:0%
very substantial that's all I got to say
 
01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:59.340 --> 01:20:59.350 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions or comments
 
01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:02.690 align:start position:0%
no other hands up represented wire just
 
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:04.540 align:start position:0%
put her hand up
 
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:07.930 align:start position:0%
McGuire yes thank you mr. chair
 
01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:10.940 align:start position:0%
my concern besides that of
 
01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:13.970 align:start position:0%
representative Bowden is that this bill
 
01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:17.150 align:start position:0%
is completely unenforceable you know
 
01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:19.070 align:start position:0%
it's a nice statement of intent and we
 
01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:21.140 align:start position:0%
all want if there are supervised
 
01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:23.090 align:start position:0%
visitation centers we want them to
 
01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:25.970 align:start position:0%
follow best principles but this doesn't
 
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:29.770 align:start position:0%
have any way for a town to
 
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:32.110 align:start position:0%
deal with or
 
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
deal with or
a

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:33.850 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:36.350 align:start position:0%
center that is found not to be in
 
01:21:40.710 --> 01:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
compliance and I think that that's
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
makes the bill totally futile
 
01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:47.090 align:start position:0%
well intentioned and a nice idea but I'm
 
01:21:56.850 --> 01:21:56.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
represent thank you I just like to point
 
01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:04.460 align:start position:0%
out in the text of the of the bill that
 
01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:07.310 align:start position:0%
there's a misspelling that should be
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
there's a misspelling that should be
corrected

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:08.050 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:11.750 align:start position:0%
at least I think it's a misspelling in
 
01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:15.500 align:start position:0%
line two of the bill or the second line
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have a number I'm looking at it
 
01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.690 align:start position:0%
I don't have a number I'm looking at it
online

01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:18.700 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:22:21.610 --> 01:22:21.620 align:start position:0%
talks about the guiding principles so
 
01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:24.260 align:start position:0%
safe havens I'm sure that should be
 
01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:30.550 align:start position:0%
spelled pls and PL ES and not PA LS its
 
01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:33.590 align:start position:0%
use of the word principles in the last
 
01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:36.470 align:start position:0%
line and it's spelled correctly so one
 
01:22:38.650 --> 01:22:38.660 align:start position:0%
of the two is wrong I'm sure it's the
 
01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:41.750 align:start position:0%
first occurrence of the word I tend to
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:46.250 align:start position:0%
with the sentiment that has been
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
expressed that this is
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:52.540 align:start position:0%
aspirational and
 
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
likely is not going to lead to much but
 
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:00.610 align:start position:0%
the principles are
 
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:04.660 align:start position:0%
quite highly recognized and so forth so
 
01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
quite highly recognized and so forth so
I

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:06.610 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:14.330 align:start position:0%
any other comments yes representative
 
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:17.770 align:start position:0%
SciTech would have a comment
 
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:19.270 align:start position:0%
SciTech would have a comment
yeah

01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:22.340 align:start position:0%
hi I'm following a representative
 
01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
Schmidt had said what I was going to but
 
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:25.730 align:start position:0%
I want to amplify it a little bit of
 
01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:28.370 align:start position:0%
course he's right it's ple but I think
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
that terminology was taken from some
 
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:34.910 align:start position:0%
other documents and it was misspelled in
 
01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:37.370 align:start position:0%
that document and I think enrolled bills
 
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:39.950 align:start position:0%
would have put it sick after it but we
 
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
can't really change a title from another
 
01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
can't really change a title from another
document

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:44.590 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:49.550 align:start position:0%
and I would probably agree because as I
 
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:53.540 align:start position:0%
look at Pam's sheet that she gave us it
 
01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:55.580 align:start position:0%
was also spelt in there and guiding
 
01:23:58.330 --> 01:23:58.340 align:start position:0%
principles P ALS so I'm thinking that
 
01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:04.390 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:08.110 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry
 
01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:10.910 align:start position:0%
well as I said it's an enrolled bills
 
01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:12.430 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I think
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I think
correct

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:15.010 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:18.350 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative Stuart
 
01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:19.810 align:start position:0%
has her hand up
 
01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:22.670 align:start position:0%
yes I was going to point out the same
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
thing something that small could be
 
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:28.910 align:start position:0%
corrected by enrolled bills but I'm sure
 
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:32.210 align:start position:0%
that in the intervening time before this
 
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:35.570 align:start position:0%
gets to that point that the source
 
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:37.790 align:start position:0%
document can be checked but that's
 
01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:39.470 align:start position:0%
certainly something that n roll' bills
 
01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:49.150 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chair so I do have a
 
01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:54.910 align:start position:0%
comment about
 
01:24:58.810 --> 01:24:58.820 align:start position:0%
in the last sentence there may be it may
 
01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:01.690 align:start position:0%
not be enforceable however it does say
 
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:06.010 align:start position:0%
that no financial support from a state
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
or municipal agency can be given to the
 
01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:11.260 align:start position:0%
divisions visitation center unless it
 
01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:13.410 align:start position:0%
dump demonstrates those principles
 
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:18.650 align:start position:0%
dump demonstrates those principles
correct

01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
that's what it says
 
01:25:25.439 --> 01:25:25.449 align:start position:0%
itself is a reason to follow these
 
01:25:25.449 --> 01:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
itself is a reason to follow these
guidelines

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:28.650 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:32.140 align:start position:0%
unless I'm misunderstanding the the
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.689 --> 01:25:42.699 align:start position:0%

motion of ought to pass by
 
01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:49.330 align:start position:0%
representative broad a second by
 
01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:52.570 align:start position:0%
representative Shu and represent God he

may speak the emotion
 
01:29:58.530 --> 01:29:58.540 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chair I am asking the
 
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
committee to support this bill due to
 
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:04.810 align:start position:0%
the need for transparency and assistance
 
01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:07.350 align:start position:0%
with with the
 
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
day care eight daycare centers that are
 
01:30:15.859 --> 01:30:15.869 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:17.830 align:start position:0%
represent shows like speak to you a
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:19.250 align:start position:0%
represent shows like speak to you a
second

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes I will just
 
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:25.510 align:start position:0%
echo what representative Cruz stated
 
01:30:30.919 --> 01:30:30.929 align:start position:0%
that it's currently unfair to have
 
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:33.610 align:start position:0%
problems that are found posted until
 
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:36.190 align:start position:0%
they have been resolved and I think this
 
01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:38.130 align:start position:0%
bill goes a long way towards solving
 
01:30:38.130 --> 01:30:41.689 align:start position:0%
bill goes a long way towards solving
them

rectify some of the issues that are
 
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
causing conflicts between daycare
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
centers and the
 
01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:40.650 align:start position:0%
agency and
 
01:34:40.650 --> 01:34:43.310 align:start position:0%
agency and
is

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:49.590 align:start position:0%
giving the daycare centers more time to
 
01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:00.250 align:start position:0%
represent speak to you a second
 
01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:03.710 align:start position:0%
yes I'll just say that this is basically
 
01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:07.790 align:start position:0%
a companion to 1710 and I think the two
 
01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.490 --> 01:35:17.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.970 --> 01:35:20.980 align:start position:0%
represented McGuire has her hand up
 
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you this is more of a question
 
01:35:28.090 --> 01:35:28.100 align:start position:0%
we passed 17 11 which creates a study
 
01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:30.860 align:start position:0%
committee on the whole process and I'm
 
01:35:34.209 --> 01:35:34.219 align:start position:0%
not sure why we need this other than as
 
01:35:34.219 --> 01:35:34.770 align:start position:0%
not sure why we need this other than as
a

01:35:34.770 --> 01:35:34.780 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:39.190 align:start position:0%
in a one-year stopgap and I'm
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:48.010 align:start position:0%
my concern going forward with the
 
01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:50.390 align:start position:0%
waste session is going right now under
 
01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:52.660 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders is
 
01:35:55.209 --> 01:35:55.219 align:start position:0%
if that Commission is unable to complete
 
01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:58.010 align:start position:0%
his work or get together in time to do
 
01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:00.410 align:start position:0%
the work before next year's filing
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
deadlines this will be some sort of a
 
01:36:04.290 --> 01:36:04.300 align:start position:0%
stopgap going forward until they
 
01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:06.830 align:start position:0%
eventually get the bill through and go
 
01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:09.140 align:start position:0%
forward and that's one of the reasons
 
01:36:11.439 --> 01:36:11.449 align:start position:0%
why I'm seeing this going forward is
 
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
because the Commission may not be set up
 
01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
in time to complete its work by the
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
in time to complete its work by the
deadline

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:16.810 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:20.660 align:start position:0%
and representative Foxx has her hand oh
 
01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:22.850 align:start position:0%
she took it down I represent a crew has
 
01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:26.330 align:start position:0%
his hand up represent proof just what
 
01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:28.190 align:start position:0%
you said we needed something in place
 
01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:29.780 align:start position:0%
until that committee can do its work
 
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
also that at this time we are not sure
 
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
how the Senate is going to react to
 
01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:52.610 align:start position:0%
bills creating studies so I would like
 
01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:54.530 align:start position:0%
to see this go forward in case they
 
01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:55.690 align:start position:0%
decide that
 
01:36:58.660 --> 01:36:58.670 align:start position:0%
studies are impractical or something of
 
01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:03.730 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.490 --> 01:37:05.500 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:09.730 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:12.510 align:start position:0%
I see no other hands
 
01:37:16.170 --> 01:37:16.180 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the motion is
 
01:37:17.970 --> 01:37:17.980 align:start position:0%
