morning esteemed
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues I rise today in support of
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
the motion to reconsider HB
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
154 at after our vote last week I
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
discovered that HB 154 as amended by the
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
body on the other side of the wall is a
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
lot more than a mere housekeeping bill I
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
learned afterwards that this is actually
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
a 15-page spring cleaning Bill since it
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
was not in our regular calendar last
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
Thursday it is unlikely that many in
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
this body myself included knew this and
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
therefore would not have had time to
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
read and research this massive non-
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
jerine Amendment
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
in this unprecedented time of decreasing
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
voter confidence and an erosion of the
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
public trust we have an opportunity this
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
morning to prove that we are actively
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
working to protect and defend their
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
rights with each and every vote we cast
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
we often hear about the ongoing assault
 
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.310 align:start position:0%
we often hear about the ongoing assault
on

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
Democracy with what we've learned since
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
last week what better way to demonstrate
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
to the voters that we will defend their
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
voice the voters have entrusted us to
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
perform a thoughtful meaningful
 
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionally responsible analysis of
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
every piece of
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislation as we know now this is not
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
what happened last week we owe it to
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
every one of our constituents to vote
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%

the issues we learned of with this
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%

vote chair recognize representative
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
weary for a parliamentary
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
if I know that as introduced HB 154
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
sought to amend one RSA using only eight
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
lines of text but this proved to be too
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
difficult for the body on the other side
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
of the wall to handle and so instead
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
they submitted an amendment containing
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
493 lines of text changing 30 rsas and
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
adding even a new
 
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
one if I knew that this also um had a
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
few typos in it that would uh be forced
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
to go into our rsas and if I knew that
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
this also had some challenges in the
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
court because there's a pending case
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
where RSA 656 colon 40 is mentioned five
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
times and under our Mason's Rule of
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
those oppose nay the eyes have it and
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%

floor Amendment
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
0627 H printed in house record 7 page 41
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
plain thank you Mr Speaker members this
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
bill may look familiar we passed it
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
through this house last year and the
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
house position is is that we wanted to
 
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
do something to uh decrease the ability
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
to weaponize Children against uh each
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
parent and against people so we were
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
going to put in place a possibility of a
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
penalty force people who knowingly and
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
with intent to harm make a false
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
accusation I'm not going to take up a
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
lot of time we have a long day you've
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
seen most of the bill I will tell you
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
that this floor Amendment adds a word
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
professional in to a section where we
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
realized there also was no penalty for a
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory professional reporter to not
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
make a report and I think that if we're
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
going to hold people to a standard of
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
not making a false report we also need
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
to hold those professionals to a
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
standard of making those reports when
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
they're mandated and not just leave it
 
00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:14.919 align:start position:0%
up to their licensing to be able to take
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
action on them so part of this bill is
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
to offer a penalty if if a known
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
professional reporter such as a doctor
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
or such fails to make a
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
report and we have narrowed the scope
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
the only AR argument that came out in
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
exec session I'm told was uh that it it
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's a mandatory reporter so this
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
would apply to everyone so we narrowed
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
that scope down to just those
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
professionals who are mandatory
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
reporters who have lived and worked
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
their life knowing that they had to make
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
reports but we realized there was no
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
teeth to that so I would ask you to
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
please support this amendment it adds
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
the word professional and it takes the
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
burden off of the majority of people
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty going on to your
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
average citizen only those mandatory
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
reporters if we pass this amendment
 
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.350 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker um like representative
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
Sweeney said we voted on this last year
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
and it uh it passed the house but it
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
didn't pass the Senate uh I personally
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
think that this is a good bill there are
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
Bad actors out there that
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh do
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
maliciously uh report to
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
DCF uh you know essentially making fake
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh claims it's
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
dcf's job to sort that out and they can
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
tell based on if there's a pattern of
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
people who uh make these uh malicious
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
reports that's for them to sort out it
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
does not affect
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
the um I'm sorry I'm saying um a lot it
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect whether or not someone
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
can report anonymously and it doesn't
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
affect mandatory
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
reporting I think this is a good bill I
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
think it should
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
pass that's that's all I have to say we
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
did it last year we should do it again
 
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.510 align:start position:0%
did it last year we should do it again
thank

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%

Raymond thank you Mr Speaker when
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
considering imposing penalties on people
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
calling dcyf it's important to
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
understand the current state of child
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
protection in New Hampshire in order to
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
make a finding of abuse DCF must show a
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence that a
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
child has suffered protracted impairment
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
from injury that was caused by other
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
than accidental means in order to have a
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
finding of neglect DCF must show a
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence that the
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
child's health has suffered harm as a
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
result of lack of supervision or care of
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
the parents and that the depr
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
deprivation was not due to financial
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
means these are difficult standards to
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
meet if dcyf receives a call that a
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
child is covered in bruises in different
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
states of healing and the parent parent
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
does not have an explanation for the
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
injuries that is an unfounded
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
report if a nonc crawling baby has
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
multiple broken bones but there is some
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
doubt about how they occurred that is an
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
unfounded report this
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
bill assumes that unfounded reports and
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
false reports are equivalent that is
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
simply not the case the vast majority of
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
people who call DCF are genuinely
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about children being in danger
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire determines that 85%
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
of reports are unfounded says more about
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
our thresholds for intervention than
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
about the motivations of people calling
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
currently every single adult in New
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is legally obligated to call
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
dcyf if they are concerned about a child
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
we are all mandated reporters under RSA
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
169c it is in the best interest of
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
children to continue this practice and
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
let the experts figure out if there is
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence to move forward the
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate and several
 
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
child welfare agencies testify that they
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
have concerns that the potential for
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
criminal charges for calling DCF will
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
have a chilling impact on people who are
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about kids having fewer people
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
called dcyf is the opposite of what we
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
need in New Hampshire the office of the
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
child advocate released their annual
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
report earlier this month in it they
 
00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
reported that 29 children under the age
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
of 17 died in New Hampshire last year 18
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
of those were
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
infants two were homicides and one died
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
as a direct result of
 
00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
abuse we should be focused on passing
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
bills that increase safety for our
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
community's children not those that make
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
it less likely for children in danger to
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
get the help they need I urge you to
 
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
vote no on otpa so that a more
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion can be made and I ask
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
for division
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
Spain thank you Mr Speaker members I'm
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
not going to take up a lot of your time
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
because we have a long day but I do want
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
to correct a couple of things this bill
 
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
makes no equivalency between an
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
unfounded report and one that would
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
qualify under this bill for uh possible
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
charges it specifically says in this
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
bill that the claim must be made
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
knowingly false Within intent to harm
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's a high bar there's not any person
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
who in their heart feels there's abuse
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
going on and makes a report that would
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
ever be charged with this in fact DCF
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
would have to discover a pattern of
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
false accusations to be able to make
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
that equivalency and refer it to the
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice this simply allows
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
us to put false accusations to DCF the
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
weaponization of Children and Families
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
on the same bar as pulling a fire alarm
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
falsely or making a false police
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
report it's needed this bill now as
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
amended applies the criminal penalty for
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
not reporting only to those professional
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
reporters not to every single
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
person those people who have been
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
trained to spot the signs and have been
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
told it is your job to report those same
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
people who are also excluded from ever
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
having a penalty put on them for a false
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
accusation because every report they
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
make is assumed to be made with intent
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
to actually get help for the child not
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
intent to harm I ask you to support this
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
bill we did pass it last year there were
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
some questions in the Senate that I or
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
in the other body excuse me that uh I
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
believe we've straightened out and I
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
think that we can get this done and make
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
families not have to suffer the
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
weaponization of our own departments in
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%

00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
if I know that we are all mandated
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
reporters and if I know that this bill
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
would only deter those that are
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
conscientious about reporting and not
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
those that intend to create harm and if
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
I know that DCF has a system for
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
Discerning false and malicious reporting
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
and if I know that you can already take
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
civil action against someone who falsely
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
makes a malicious and frivolous report
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
against you and if I know that it is in
 
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
the best interest to not deter reports
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
that will protect children would I not
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
press the red button so that a more
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
made chair recognize representative D
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that everything
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
everybody has set up here misses the
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
fact that when somebody falsely reports
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
and it is proven there are no
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
consequences if I
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
know that truthful reporting whether
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's found unfounded or not and it is
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
not a vicious horrible attack on a
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
family that you're angry
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
with nothing will happen to you if I
 
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.870 align:start position:0%
with nothing will happen to you if I
know

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
finally that of the thousands of calls
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
that D HHS and DCF
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
gets there are no assumptions nobody
 
00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
gets there are no assumptions nobody
assumes

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
anything there are no consequences and
 
00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
if I know that there are no consequences
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
for such a heinous act of ripping a
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
family apart unnecessarily that then I
 
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:00.280 align:start position:0%

Speaker I just have to uh pull up my

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
laptop
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
here um New Hampshire is one of nine
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
states that does not provide a formula
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment for time sharing um in their
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines we were there
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
was a study done in 2004 that gave us a
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
parenting adjustment guideline and that
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
was not implemented as of yet uh so 1595
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
the whole point of it is to implement
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
those guidelines with some new studies
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh done that accounts for equal
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
parenting time with the
 
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.950 align:start position:0%
parenting time with the
child

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
um it also accounts for medical support
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
and child care expenses for both
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
parents and and it bases proportional
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
contributions on the adjusted gross
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
income so it's the whole point is for it
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
to be fair for both parents to give more
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
self-support for be both parents and to
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
account for the time that the child is
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
with both
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
parents um
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
so there there's just been a lot of
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
studies done in composing this bill uh
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
it removes something called a cliff
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
effect that some studies or some states
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
that have implemented this model have
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
noticed in the years that they've
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
implemented it where eventually you um
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard to it's hard to describe
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
without you seeing the picture
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
but there's a there's an effect called a
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
cliff effect where when the parenting
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
time increases the child support also
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
increases and then the self- support for
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
the person uh ends up decreasing this
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill adjusts for that so that we don't
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
effect this bill also accounts for all
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
income ratios so it will give the same
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
model for people that are of low income
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
of moderate income and of high
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
income so I would ask for you to support
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 1595 FN is relevant
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
to the adjustment of child support
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
inclusiv of par paren time medical
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
support and child care expenses there
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
are several concerns testified to at the
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
hearing I relay a few that I hope you
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
will consider while making your vote
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
one was for a long time the Hampshire
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
one was from a long time the Hampshire
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
and mass divorce attorney who warned
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
that the calculation as it relates to
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
parenting time would create tension
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
between parenting time knowing that the
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
more time spent with my child the less
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
child support I'll pay often times in
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
high conflict cases party Drive their
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
cases as to where they benefit telling
 
00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
us that courts are picking winners and
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
losers when in reality it's the children
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
that are the only winners and losers
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
section five of the bill States the
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
court may consider adjusting the
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines to include extracurricular
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
activity among several other factors in
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
CFL we hear a testimony from residents
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
that are challenging their final decree
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
and a common denominator is often the
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
extra expenses that they pay benefiting
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
the child or children I'm of the opinion
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
that in minimizing conflicts these
 
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
considerations shall be considered and
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
and we just passed a uh child support
 
00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:26.150 align:start position:0%
and we just passed a uh child support
bill

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh the last couple last couple of votes
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
we took that uh that shall have uh the
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activity um has a uh has
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
an adjustment uh the committee also
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
received communication from uh nhla the
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hamshire legal assistance in opposition
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
to the bill staing that it will increase
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
the ability of domestic abusers
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
financially control their partners and
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
will place more victims and Children at
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
Risk of poverty when fleeing abuse and H
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
La states that there is no exceptions
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
provided in this bill for courts to vary
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
the support calculation where an abuser
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
is using a system to further abuse a
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
victim and in closing I'm of the opinion
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
that it would be difficult in
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
articulating this House's position if
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%

okay thank you uh Mr
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker um first of all the bill that we
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
did pass just a little while ago takes
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
care of another end of the spectrum
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
presid we take care of the zero side of
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
spectrum where parents have no time or
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
very little time with their children the
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
one we just passed takes care of equal
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
time okay does something there this bill
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
goes in the middle it fills the Gap that
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
we have been told to fill for many many
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
years now I give a little background I
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
was a member of the child and family law
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
committee for 12 years starting in
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
1998 before coming back to it 12 years
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
later it has been a pleasant surprise
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
for me to see many families that break
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
up now agreeing to share significant
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
amounts of parenting time with the
 
00:54:34.119 --> 00:54:35.990 align:start position:0%
amounts of parenting time with the
Court's

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
Court's
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
approval it rarely happened when I was
 
00:54:41.309 --> 00:54:41.319 align:start position:0%

00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
out the need for a formula that covers
 
00:54:54.799 --> 00:54:55.710 align:start position:0%
out the need for a formula that covers
more

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
situations today shared parenting is
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
widespread with varying amounts of
 
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.950 align:start position:0%
widespread with varying amounts of
parenting

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
time the guidelines formula presently
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
only addresses the one parent household
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
I spoke
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
to um 2019 there was a Supreme Court
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
decision called
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
Anderson which affirmed that there
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
should be a set of guidelines dealing
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
with various parenting times and
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
incomes and it was the legislature's job
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
to fix the problem so the we've been
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
warned we've got a serious problem we
 
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
got to fix this is the bill that fixes
 
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
that HB 1564 addresses 50-50 parenting
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
time issue but this bill fixes the Gap
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
as I pointed
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
out by law the child sport guidelines
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
must be reviewed every four years with
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations about changing the
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines to be Equitable the studies
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
are done by economists social scientists
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
with Doctorate Degrees
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
they are far more sophisticated than the
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
one I was on in 2004 the most recent
 
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.150 align:start position:0%
one I was on in 2004 the most recent
2022

00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
review was contracted by the uh Bureau
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
of Child Support Services with the
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
University of Colorado in cost tax pays
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
$6,350 and if we don't pass this bill
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
that means we've just ignored all that
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
money the last one that was done four
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
years before that said the same thing
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
$140,000 you will find these reviews on
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
the Bure of Child Support Services
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
website waiting for us to put the
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations to good use they cost
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
too much to be
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
ignored all five reviews for the last 20
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
years have all recommended New Hampshire
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
adopt a parenting time formula and that
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
is what HP 1595 does it adopts a formula
 
00:56:56.109 --> 00:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with what California and
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
Oregon have in place now Oregon leaders
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
report that the formula has reduced
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
litigation and that's right in the
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
report the 2022 study states that New
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of nine states that
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
does not provide a
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
formulaic adjustment for time sharing in
 
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
the child support
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines based on the findings from
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
the case filed data almost 3/4 74% of
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
divorce and parenting petitions have a
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
parenting plan that provides that the
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
child will be in the physical care of
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
one of each parent for a significant
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
time the majority 61% of these cases
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
deviate from New Hampshire
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines the study
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
found this 61% deviations rate is too
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
high New Hampshire is very high in
 
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
deviations if if we only went with the
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
last bill we've heard about we were told
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
by child support service their attorney
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
came to our committee and told us we're
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
going to be going high when we get into
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
this it's got problems that way but this
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
um we it is good that we did pass out
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
the bill because it does have a self
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
support Reserve uh in it moving it from
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
120% to
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
30% uh the the uh Bureau of Child
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
Support Services attorney did not see
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
any problems with the bill before us in
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
fact I don't even remember any
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
opposition at the public
 
00:58:42.119 --> 00:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
opposition at the public
hearing

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
um so anyway I I guess that's all I can
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
tell you someone has a
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
oh oh thank
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
you the motion before us is ought to
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
1595 long has asked for a division vote
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:54.190 align:start position:0%
 
seats

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
clear

00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is auto pass on
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1595 this is a division vote
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Greg for
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
if I know that this body just passed a
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
more wellth thought out bipartisan bill
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
that conflicts with this bill and if I
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
know that the bill already passed by
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
this body does increase the needed
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
self-support Reserve in this bill does
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
not and if I know the bill this bill
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
does not include a necessary exception
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence findings and the
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
monetary weaponization that happens all
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
too frequently within it and if I know
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill will create an even more
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
conflict within our complicated family
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
court system would I not press the red
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
button so that another motion can be
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
made you I recognize representative mag
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
leori for a parliamentary
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.190 align:start position:0%
leori for a parliamentary
inquiry

01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
know that HB 1595 is a child support
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
Bill sponsored by Democrats and
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
Republicans that will Implement
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations made by the latest
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
federally mandated review of our child
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
support system and if I know the major
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation in that latest federally
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
required review as well as
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the all five
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
reviews for the last 20 years have
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
recommended that New Hampshire needs a
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive formula for parenting time
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
adjustments and if I know that the
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
current child support calculator has a
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
flaw in it that negatively affects the
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
lower income parent in HB
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
1595 effectively fixes this and Mr
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know the proposed formula
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
in this bill comes from these
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations that 22 other states
 
01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.150 align:start position:0%
recommendations that 22 other states
have

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
implemented reflects the preferred
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
methodology identified by courts
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
attorneys and parents interviewed for
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
the review and the correction will bring
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
the calculation meth methodology in line
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
with the Benchmark 2019 New Hampshire
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case on the issue and Mr
 
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:10.839 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this gradual change
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
that will be phased in over several
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
years without undue burden to our legal
 
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
system then Mr Speaker would I press the
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%

01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%

the committee's amendment because it is
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
a fundamental change to the bill that I
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%

legalize recreational use and private
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
sale of cannabis and makes it an agency
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
store model restricting recreational use
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
and private sale if this amendment
 
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
passes and the bill becomes law as
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
amended an individual who wants to go
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
buy cannabis for recreational reasons
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
will have to go to one of the 15
 
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
agencies stores approved by the state
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
and buy cannabis from a state sanctioned
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
distributor that is not the free market
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
nor is it a good way to
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
legalize big corporate cannabis has
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely ruined the industry where it
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
has been allowed to opening the door for
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
big multi-state and in some cases
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
multinational businesses
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
to swoop in to those 15 stores that we
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
would have in this bill and buy up those
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
stores with the big money that they have
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
for their lobbyists and they have to buy
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
up those
 
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.590 align:start position:0%
up those
stores

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
stores
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
when all these for that would be forcing
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents to buy
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
overpriced and under quality product
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
when they could cross the border on any
 
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
side of our state and buy quality
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
product for AOW lower price with more
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
variety why would they cross the
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
border why would they stay and buy
 
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
something here in New Hampshire if they
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
could cross the border so easily to buy
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
something cheaper better and with more
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
variety what is the point of legalizing
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
if people aren't going to be using those
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
agency stores the monopolization of
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
these State markets by these large
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
companies is not a fanciful idea it has
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
happened where wherever it has been
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to even with the guard rails in
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
place and if someone as I said could buy
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
it from the black market with more
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
variety why would they not do that there
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
are many problems with this bill 6
 
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
months to a year in jail for misdemeanor
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
for public use of marijuana so if you're
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
just happen to be walking on the street
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
and a cop sees you and you're smoking a
 
01:11:49.229 --> 01:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
joint if and you assume that you can
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
because the bill is legal and then the
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
cop sees you and picks you up you could
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
end up with a missed toor charge and in
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
jail for up to a year we have these
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
agency stores running differently than
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
the liquor stores by within the bill
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
proposing an excise tax on the profit of
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
these stores leaving the door wide open
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
for the black market to continue to
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
flourish this bill does nothing to
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
address the black market which is
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the point of
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
legalization consumers can't legally
 
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
grow the plant under this legislation so
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
what is the point of legalizing a plant
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
if people can't in their own domicile in
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
their own castle grow the plant that's
 
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.310 align:start position:0%
their own castle grow the plant that's
not

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
legalization folks this bill this
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
amendment will satisfy the hunger that
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
we all feel many of us feel for
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
legalization but it is a baloney
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
sandwich and will leave us
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
satisfied but in a few hours we'll be
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
hungry again because there was no
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
nutrition there so I ask you folks this
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
is not the year to legalize in a poor
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
manner we can come back when the
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
lobbyists have less control on the other
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
side of the Wall come together as the
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
state that we are and pass a free market
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
solution to legalization that opens the
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
door for all people to have control over
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
what they want with this uh drug so
 
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker does the
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
evidence do you have that um that
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis sold through through this uh
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
model will be that it
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
will that it will be not will not be
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
cheaper and will will not be better than
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
what's out on the market and that uh the
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
the black market will do a better job
 
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
can you tell me where you got that
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
evidence better job I don't think I said
 
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
the black market would do a better job I
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
said the black market would have cheaper
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis under this model and
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate the question
 
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
I cannot say the name of the company
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
I've already made that mistake here on
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
the house floor in some cases but there
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
are a number of companies one of them
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
that has been buying up stores across
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
the country wherever it is legal they
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
will buy up those stores and then make
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
the price of that cannabis
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily high and that is not
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's monopolization that raises the
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
prices it's happened in Florida it's
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
happened in other states and if we
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
allowed it to happen with the agency
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
model here where we have a restriction
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
on only 15 stores then those who has the
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
money to buy those to become one of
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
those agencies who has the money to
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
Lobby to become one of those agencies
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
those companies so that's why the price
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you this will be my last
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
question representative um I believe
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
that you're a sponsor on the bill so my
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
question is how many of the hearings did
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
you participate in and communicate with
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
other people who are on on the
 
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill I'm
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
sorry the member needs not answer that's
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
not that is that question was not that
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
that question was not appropriate okay
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues I recognize the challenges
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
identified by my colleague from Peter B
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
burrow from this bill but our question
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
is do we pass something that is makes a
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
lot of us happy here in a free or Market
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
situation or do we pass something that
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
meets the outlines that are actually
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
laid out for legalization to happen in
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and for us to stop being
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
an island of
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
prohibition there is an idea that was
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
floated through a commission over the
 
01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
summer and favored by some on the other
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
side of this wall that truly would have
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
a very tightly controlled Market where
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
there' be significant opportunity for
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
multi-state operations to take a very
 
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
controlling interest in the process this
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
bill addresses the requirements by the
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
man with the pen in a way that allows
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
the market to open up and to increase
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
assuming that we see that this is a good
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
way a good New Hampshire way to bring
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
about legalization with quality product
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
at lower
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
prices on page uh in the middle of page
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
74 there's actually an outline of the
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
reasons why we would increase the number
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
of stores that would be responsive to
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
the market after this has been launched
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
and after we know what it looks like to
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
sell cannabis here in New Hampshire in a
 
01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
lawful way it also has a 10% charge
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
which is half that of surrounding states
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
between a third and a quarter of what it
 
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
is in um California where the Black
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
Market has been um basically
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
supercharged by doing this I believe
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
that this is a path that where we can
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
move forward and then we can figure out
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done and what needs to
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
be tweaked in the future to make this
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
the best model um as my colleague speaks
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
about the penalty for smoking in public
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
there there have been some states where
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
college students have seen that it's
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
legal and they've gone around blowing
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
smoke in people's faces that's just
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
offensive and there needs to be a
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
penalty from that but we'd be looking at
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
a third offense after convictions before
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
you would be facing a misdemeanor charge
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be unaware of it there's
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
ways to be discreet and respectful for
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
those people who still want to consume
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to smoke in order to
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
consume um finally I ask that you
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
support this amendment if you do support
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
a past path to legalization I believe
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's a compromise every single person in
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
a seat here can find a reason to vote
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
against the amendment and to vote
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
against the bill but the question is do
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
we have a net benefit to the state by
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
passing this and I truly do that's why I
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
fought this battle and I hope you'll
 
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
join me in passing this amendment thank
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
you the motion before us is on the
 
01:17:47.199 --> 01:17:49.830 align:start position:0%
you the motion before us is on the
amendment

01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
0680 this is a division vote members
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:45.709 align:start position:0%
 
seats

01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
0680 this is a division vote chair
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Heath Howard
 
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker uh and
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
thank you fellow representatives for
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
letting me speak today uh cannabis
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
legalization should happen in this state
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
but the committee amendment is makes
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
this bill worse and if I know that not
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
only uh that this bill not only keeps
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
the current misdemeanor charges for
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
people smoking in public but also
 
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
increases the second violation f
 
01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
if I know that this would create a
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
state-owned model not bold or large
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
enough to force out the black market by
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
imposing an excise tax and limiting the
 
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and if I know that this is
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
not a free market model by forcing out
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for private businesses
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
to join the market and if I know that
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
this bill does not include homow or en
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
nment of cannabis related charges then I
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to join me in
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button so an ought
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
toass motion can be made thank you J

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:08.070 align:start position:0%

01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
if I know it's been a long time to try
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
to get a bill that has almost uniform
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
consensus that is the right answer for
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if I know that the state
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
has already proven that agency soures
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
are successful we do already have them
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
for liquor and yes they're very
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
competitive price-wise if I know that
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
this was well thought out yes maybe
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
there are some other pieces that people
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
would like to see but that can happen in
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
the future if I know Mr Speaker the time
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
is now to pass it will I now vote
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:53.350 align:start position:0%
is now to pass it will I now vote

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.750 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the vote on the
amendment

members I'm going to agree with my
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
colleague from Peter burough that now is
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
not the time to pass marijuana
 
01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
legislation in the state of New
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's more than just
 
01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana issues on this
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
bill there's mental health issues on

homelessness issues on this bill there's
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
many reasons that everyone in here could
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
find to not pass marijuana legislation
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
sure that my colleagues on this side of
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
the aisle would agree that education
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
teaching our kids to stay off drugs is
 
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
something that is very important to them
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
and harm reduction is something that is
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
important to them this bill does not
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
meet the level of guide rails that we
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
were looking for in our commit this
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
summer I I sat on the commission this
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
summer and we voted not to proceed with
 
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
legislation on the commission this
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
summer and uh I would urge you to vote
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
no on the ought to pass
 
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
wal thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
rise today in opposition to the majority
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
vote on HB

1633 the proposed legislation of
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana will lead New Hampshire down a
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
horrible and expensive path a 2022
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
report suggests that marijuana growhouse
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
emits as much
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
CO2 as 3.3 million cars on the

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
times more energy intensive than a coal
 
01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:37.719 align:start position:0%

of the most energy intensive Industries

spending an estimated 6 billion on
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
energy annually that's a hefty electric
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill especially for New Hampshire the
 
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
state with the highest electric
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
electricity costs in the country and
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
energy consumption issues will only
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
worsen research estimates that annual

marijuana cultivation electricity demand
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%

65% over the next 10 years
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%

01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker I apologize um I I want to
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
address some of the concerns raised by
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
my colleague from Raymond first this
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill was never intended to represent the
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
views of the commission over the summer
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
I had expected something else to come
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
out as that commission was charged with
 
01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.910 align:start position:0%
out as that commission was charged with
drafting

01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
legislation however in order to reach
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
something that would bring us
 
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.229 align:start position:0%
something that would bring us
legalization

01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
we worked hard we worked earnestly in
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
order to meet as many of those
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
requirements and as many of those goals
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
as possible through that process we have
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
10% of funds that are going to the
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
substance use prevention and Recovery
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
treatment fund we have 5% of the funds
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to Children's Behavioral Health we
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous amount of Education
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
that is included because it's a lot
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
better to tell children why they
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't use cannabis while their brain
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
are developing instead of just saying
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's illegal don't do it in my town of
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
Derry about 10 years ago there was
 
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
somebody talking to the Town Council so
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed that she was unable to
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
convince the school children that it was
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
just as dangerous to use heroin as it
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
was to use
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis now that's a problem how many
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
of those children do you think decided
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
to use heroin since they had tried
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis or their friend had and if they
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
say they're the same why don't I try it
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
education is more than just saying it's
 
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
illegal don't do it and I think that
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
bringing legalization will help our
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
children so that we can have a true
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
honest conversation about where the
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
risks of cannabis actually
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
are as far as the police and public
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
service this bill puts 5% of proceeds to
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
police and First Responders specifically
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
for drug recognition
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
experts there's a lot of people in the
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
state Who currently use cannabis I
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
really don't think the number is going
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
to increase much by passing this
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill with that you'll have a few people
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
who are rule followers who don't want to
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
go across state lines who have decided
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
that because they can buy it in town
 
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
they will but I don't really think the
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
rule followers are the ones that we're
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about we're concerned about
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
those people who are buying it on the
 
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
black market and they're buying product
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's contaminated by fentanyl because
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
of poor product handling we have people
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
dying from that we also have other
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
people who are receiving it wherever
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
they want and driving while
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
you know that's really hard for people
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
in towns that don't have drug
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
recognition experts so passing this bill
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
and adding that funding is going to be a
 
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
net benefit for Public Safety as we have
 
01:29:05.229 --> 01:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
more trained PE trained officers and
 
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
cars who can spot people who are driving
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
Under the
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
Influence that is a good reason itself
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill for people who want to
 
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
increase Public
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
Safety and then as far as the energy use
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
I hope my colleague will at some point
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
move towards home cultivation where
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
people can use natural sunlight and
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
allow this to work as a plant but I know
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
the state isn't ready for that yet but
 
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'd love to work on those conservation
 
01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
efforts in the
 
01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
future all in all cannabis is here the
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not we provide an
 
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
outlet for people who are currently
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
turning to the
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
streets a way to buy it in the state and
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
we keep some of the sales here in New
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire liquor store liquor sales here
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
in the state benefit from people coming
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire while cannabis sales in
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
other states benefit from people leaving
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to make these per these
 
01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.910 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to make these per these
purpose

01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
purchases quite frankly I think it's
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
high time we legalize marijuana in this
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
state we do it in a way that actually
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
can be signed into law and then we move
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
forward on the details together with
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I ask for your support on this at
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
to pass at to pass's amended motion and
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can move forward on this
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
and actually end our status as an island
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
of prohibition thank you does member
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.109 --> 01:30:31.119 align:start position:0%
yields thank you Mr I thank you for
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is in the
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
research that has been done on this
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
topic and the states that we've compared
 
01:30:39.629 --> 01:30:39.639 align:start position:0%
to is there has there ever been any
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
evidence whatsoever that there's been
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
increases in traffic fatalities or any
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
whatsoever uh thank you for the question
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
when you look at some of the data you
 
01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
look at reporting biases as well I don't
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
actually know the traffic data because
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I I think that whether you
 
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
are one state where it's legal around
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
you or not isn't going to move the
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
needle that far what we do have to look
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
at is people do talk about some about
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
reporting more usage and that's because
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
if your child has ingested something
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
you're less afraid to tell the police
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
tell the police or tell the hospital
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
what happened so they can treat him
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
right um I think that more trans Arcy is
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
good I think that we need to make sure
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
that everything is handled safely and
 
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
this bill has a lot of ways to increase
 
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and um I think that by
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
having more drug recognition experts our
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
safer pres kill has asked for a division
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:32:20.669 align:start position:0%

trying to walk back their marijuana
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%

01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
citizen in New Hampshire deserves to
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%

are the
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
future and if I know we should teach

them well and let them lead the
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%

01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker when
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
this bill came to the committee at first
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
blush I thought this you know this was a
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
good idea um to let someone have the
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
ability to decide what they wanted to do
 
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
with their own with their own
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
rights and then as we heard testimony my
 
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
my opinion slowly changed because first
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
of all the the Second Amendment right as
 
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
we know is not granted by the state or
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government the Second
 
01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment right existed before The
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution was ever
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
drafted what we do know is that this
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
bill would allow you to put your name on
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
a registry that future you could not
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
purchase a
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
firearm the problem is
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
that what if someone influences you to
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
put your name on that what if for
 
01:41:34.109 --> 01:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
example you are involved with a
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist and the psychiatrist you've
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
seen for years and you depend on for
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
your mental health says to you if you
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
want to continue seeing me you have to
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
put your name on this registry you now
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a choice keep your second amendment
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
rights or lose your doctor what if where
 
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
you live they say we don't allow people
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
who aren't on this list there are a
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
plethora of ways that someone could be
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
influenced and coerced into giving up
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
their god-given Second Amendment
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
right the part that really really
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
twisted it for me was the testimony we
 
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
heard from the Hampshire Medical
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
Association from a psychiatrist himself
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
he said
 
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
we like this because it gives a list of
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
who owns firearms and we have been long
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
in favor of and support of and wanted
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
lists of people that own
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
firearms that scares me and it should
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
scare you whether you support the Second
 
01:42:36.589 --> 01:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment or not any government agency
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
or or any organization that wants lists
 
01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
of people for any reason is scary I
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
would ask you to overturn to pass so
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you Mr Speaker before I start
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that because uh this
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill and my remarks deal with suicide I
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
want to remind anybody who's listening
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
in uh on the live stream or in the
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
gallery who's dealing with a mental
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
health crisis that help and support are
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
available here in New Hampshire by
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
calling the suicide and crisis hotline
 
01:43:30.679 --> 01:43:34.910 align:start position:0%
calling the suicide and crisis hotline
at

01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
988 over the summer I met a New
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mom that lost her only son to
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
a gun suicide and her reason uh is the
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
re is the is why I filed her story is
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
why I filed this bill um and and why I'm
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
standing before you
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
today I've had a lot of conversations
 
01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
with her over the last few months and
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
what I've learned from those
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
conversations are three
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
things the devastating impact that a
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
tragedy like this can have on the people
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
that are left
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
behind the finality of an attempted
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
attempt an attempted uh suicide by
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
firearm which has a 90% success
 
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
rate and most importantly I've learned
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
that there are small but significant
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
changes we can make to our laws to help
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
people who are at risk for suicide as
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
well as their
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
families there are many people who
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
experience Suicidal Thoughts they can be
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
veterans police officers the coach of
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
your kids baseball team your friends
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
even members of your own
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
family some are prone to severe
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
depression others may suffer from severe
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
bipolar disorder a surprising number
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
have never even been treated for mental
 
01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
illness at all because half of the
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
people who have Suicidal Thoughts are
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
never actually treated for mental
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
illness outwardly these people may look
 
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
fine and if you ask them most would tell
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
you that they're fine at least they are
 
01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:07.270 align:start position:0%
you that they're fine at least they are
for

01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
now but they also know that when they're
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
in crisis the catastrophic mood swings
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
and the overwhelming urge to do
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
back some of them also know that having
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
a firearm in their lives during one of
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
these times of Crisis will put them at a
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically higher risk of taking their
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
own life in most parts of the country
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire there's no
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
ability to voluntarily add yourself to
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
the federal background check system so
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
you can't purchase a firearm what this
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
bill would do is change that by
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%

01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
rules for handling these
 
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
applications once a person is on the
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
list and in the system they will no
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
longer be able to pass a background
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
check to be able to purchase any type of
 
01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
firearm if they change their mind and
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
they wish to have their ability to
 
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm restored all they
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
need to do is fill out a simple form to
 
01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
do that they will not need a signature
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
from their doctor their lawyer or anyone
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
else that's because the only person who
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
can apply to put you on the list or take
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
you off of the list is
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
you and on the matter of coercion uh or
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
the potential for coercion by
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and uh and medical people
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of us take
 
01:46:56.669 --> 01:46:56.679 align:start position:0%
medication uh and one of the things that
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
I always ask my doctor before he puts me
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
on a medication is are there
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
Alternatives you know what are the
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that are available to me um
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
is this something that I I really need
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
to do uh is it something that's that's
 
01:47:13.149 --> 01:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
really essential I I've never actually
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
had a doctor refus to treat me because I
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
refuse to take a torvest Statin um and I
 
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that that situation um uh
 
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
while there uh there's always the
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
potential for people to try to influence
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
your decision I don't think we're in a
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
situation where we're going to have
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
medical professionals coercing people uh
 
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
to put themselves on this
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
list I also want to point out to you
 
01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
that the bill includes a Class B
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor penalty for anyone who
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
attempts to to enroll uh or to remove
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
another person for that from that list
 
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line again is the only
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
person who can put you on the list or
 
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
take you off the list is you there's
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
also an entire section of the bill
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
devoted to confidentiality in the
 
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
protection of
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
privacy contrary to what you may have
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
heard this bill doesn't take anybody's
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
guns away if a person decides to
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and temporarily suspend
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
their right to purchase a firearm there
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
is a process for them to end that
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
suspension if they decide that's what
 
01:48:18.589 --> 01:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
they truly
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
want the bottom line is it's not a
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
decision about whether or not to own a
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
firearm it's a personal health care
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
decision and a case study in empowering
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
the freedom of choice in a state where
 
01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
many of us like to loudly Proclaim how
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
much we treasure personal
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
Liberty so today we have a choice we can
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
trust that people who find themselves in
 
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
this situation know themselves and know
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
their vulnerabilities far better than we
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
do or we can insert ourselves into a
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
person personal decision that would
 
01:48:53.669 --> 01:48:53.679 align:start position:0%

Balden thank you Mr Speaker rewards
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
programs know the difference between a
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
gas purchase and a restaurant purchase
 
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
because credit card companies apply
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
codes to Merchants this bill would ban
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
credit card companies from fact labeling
 
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
Firearms Merchants Advocates of this
 
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
legislation argue that this bill
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
prevents big government from meddling in
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
their second amendment rights however
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
the only impact this bill has on
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
government is that it enlists the State
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to penalize a private
 
01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
company when they accurately label a
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
merchant within their own system
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
additionally advocates for this bill
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
were unable to address how this
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
legislation would impact Federal
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
investigations of terrorist activities
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
the committee discussed whether
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
terrorist activities rely on credit
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
cards and for a 2002 FBI report they do
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
HP 1186 grows government and puts our
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%

this issue and bringing it forward to us
for

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
consideration um this Bill what it does
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
is when you purchase a firearm or a
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
firearm accessory or ammunition with
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
your credit card there's a specific code
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
that goes on that that the bank keeps
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
and the bank will transfer that at at
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
the request without warrant to the
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Commerce the Department of
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
Commerce has asked for this information
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for this information they
 
02:00:45.629 --> 02:00:45.639 align:start position:0%
don't care if you buy milk if you buy a
 
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
car if you buy a boat they want to know
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
about your Firearms purchases
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
why that's none of their
 
02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
business just this week the state of
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
Iowa passed the exact same bill and I
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
believe four or five other states have
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
passed it in the last year or two now we
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
heard that well the credit card
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
companies have paused it for a little
 
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
while because certain states are pushing
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
back we are right we're pushing back
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
stay out of our business stay out of my
 
02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
credit card bills stay out of my life
 
02:01:18.430 --> 02:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
this is the Second Amendment it's none
 
02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:20.199 align:start position:0%

02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:22.760 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that when federal
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
firearms dealers sell a certain number
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
of firearms to an individual in a
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
certain number of days consecutive
 
02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
business days they must report those
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
sales to
 
02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
ATF I also know that this bill
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily prohibits the use of a new
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
more accurate firearm Merchant category
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
code that could help ATF prevent gun
 
02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
violence stemming from cases of straw
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%

casualty
 
02:03:41.069 --> 02:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
events and if I and finally if I know
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
contrary to the claims of the proponents
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
that this code is not a threat to
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
individual privacy since it only
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
indicates the type of merchant it does
 
02:03:54.350 --> 02:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
not provide any details about the
 
02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
not provide any details about the

2018 the New Hampshire Constitution was

disciplinary board similar to what o PLC

everybody else has a board of three so
 
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
we're creating a board of three to
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
this bill also or the amendment also
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
allows people who have been placed on
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary website
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
list that after seven years just like
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
all the other boards your name will be
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
removed and but that information goes
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
into your file the other thing that it
 
02:12:43.629 --> 02:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
does is if you have passed away they can
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
actually take your name off the list
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
because you're not coming back for a job
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
so uh I actually had a friend who passed
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
away and tried to get their name removed
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
from the list and they said nope can't
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
do it there's no provision in law so
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create that so we can
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
remove the uh people who have passed as
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
well and like I said this is a
 
02:13:10.589 --> 02:13:10.599 align:start position:0%

filed all the forms they needed to they
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
did all the things they needed to and
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
they didn't do any of the things they

02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire does not have
 
02:18:19.150 --> 02:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
its own nonprofit manage the day-to-day
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
transactions as do all of the other
 
02:18:25.709 --> 02:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
states HB 1128 fixes
 
02:18:28.349 --> 02:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
this this bill requires the state to
 
02:18:30.669 --> 02:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
have its own nonprofit Incorporated
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
right here in New Hampshire and just
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
like the other states the nonprofit
 
02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
would file federal tax returns that show
 
02:18:39.549 --> 02:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
how much money is received from the
 
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
state and from charitable
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
contributions how much is used to fund
 
02:18:47.070 --> 02:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
efas and how much is retained for
 
02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
administ ative costs currently only
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
administrative costs so far totaling
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
nearly $2 million have been reported
 
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
without any explanation about how the
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
those funds were used or whether those
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
funds were used to cover costs in other
 
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
states there's no record of the more
 
02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
than $45 million in state funds used for
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire EFA program so far no
 
02:19:18.990 --> 02:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
record on on any charitable tax
 
02:19:21.389 --> 02:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
filing New Hampshire should have its own
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
nonprofit to manage the efas in fact it
 
02:19:27.469 --> 02:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
would be among the largest 1% of
 
02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
charities in the state the federal
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
filings would be complete and accurate
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
and the use of funds to administer the
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
program for New Hampshire kids would be
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
clear we can do a lot better than we're
 
02:19:42.990 --> 02:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
doing right now Granite Staters deserve
 
02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:45.800 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill would make the children's
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund ineligible to run the
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
education tax credit program because
 
02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
they are not Incorporated in this state
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
but they file annually with the New
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Secretary of State and
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and continue to be
 
02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
in good
 
02:22:30.429 --> 02:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
standing and if I know the reason
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're not Incorporated in this state
 
02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
is because they can run the program more
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
efficiently through the parent
 
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
organization which saves taxpayer
 
02:22:43.630 --> 02:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
dollars and allows more money to go to
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
students in
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
need and if I know that the
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
award-winning children's scholarship
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
fund is the only approved scholarship
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
organization to run both the education
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
tax credit and EFA program and that both
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
programs would effectively be eliminated
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
by this bill would I now protect
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities for thousands
 
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:11.760 align:start position:0%

uh thank you Mr Speaker if I believe
 
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
that the organization managing the
 
02:23:26.269 --> 02:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
education of tracks credits and the
 
02:23:28.349 --> 02:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program should
 
02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
be recognized in the state of New
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by registering as a non-profit
 
02:23:37.870 --> 02:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
Corporation if I believe that currently
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
the education tax credit and the
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program is
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
registered with a New York based
 
02:23:47.269 --> 02:23:47.279 align:start position:0%

already happening and are currently in

place at the campuses of our state

universities and
 
02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
colleges but this bill also proposes a
 
02:34:37.230 --> 02:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all process and
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
requirement that should not be the way
 
02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
to address the several layers of
 
02:34:43.230 --> 02:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
violations the severity of the
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
infraction or the choices of those
 
02:34:48.269 --> 02:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
involved at our universities and
 
02:34:51.469 --> 02:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
colleges this bill requires adherence to
 
02:34:54.429 --> 02:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
specific measures at all levels the
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
university system suggested this bill
 
02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
could increase the number of formal
 
02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
hearings in an academic Year from about
 
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
80 to more than
 
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
3,000 Not only would this be costly but
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
it would also slow the process of
 
02:35:12.510 --> 02:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
resolving disciplinary issues for
 
02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:15.720 align:start position:0%

employer have agreed on the process for
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
addressing those disciplinary
 
02:35:32.030 --> 02:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
concerns Implement implementation of
 
02:35:35.309 --> 02:35:35.319 align:start position:0%
these rigid requirements in 1288 and its
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
one-sized fitall for unionized employees
 
02:35:41.070 --> 02:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
would require extended negotiations with
 
02:35:43.389 --> 02:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
various bargaining units to change
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
agreements to meet the letter of the law
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
1288 is a problem in search of a
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
solution there was no testimony pointing
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
to issues that needed to be addressed at
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
our state's public colleges and
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
University on the other hand we heard
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
significant testimony that this
 
02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
legislation would create unnecessary
 
02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and costly burdens for the
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
University and Community College systems
 
02:36:11.710 --> 02:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
to replace their process requirements to
 
02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
set up a new procedure to develop
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
introduce and formulate the various
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
components required in this bill would
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
cause confusion and disruption by
 
02:36:24.030 --> 02:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
creating a parallel program to the one
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's currently in place and almost
 
02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:27.110 align:start position:0%
that's currently in place and almost
duplicates

02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
duplicates
 
02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
it in the absence of demonstrated
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
problems there is no evidence to suggest
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
that we should or need to change the
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
approach to disciplinary policy
 
02:36:41.309 --> 02:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
procedures now the legisl the
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislature has a long history of
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
leaving process and operation issues
 
02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
like this to the Board of Trustees and
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
administrators of our community college
 
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
system and our University system rather
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
than creating detailed management
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
instructions I urge you to vote no on
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%

1288 this bill establishes certain
 
02:37:27.389 --> 02:37:27.399 align:start position:0%
minimum due proc process protections
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
that students student organizations and
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
faculty members at public uh higher
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
education institutions must be afforded
 
02:37:39.469 --> 02:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
before they can be suspended expelled
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
fired of fired from employment or for
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
student organizations deprived of any
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
rights enjoyed by other other student
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
organizations an issue had come up
 
02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
during the during the course of this
 
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee proceedings on this bill is
 
02:37:55.269 --> 02:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
why does it Focus only on those why not
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of Staff people that are
 
02:37:59.389 --> 02:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
employed why doesn't the bill Encompass
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
them and the answer to that is that as
 
02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen around the country those are
 
02:38:07.150 --> 02:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
generally not the not the people who are
 
02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
who end up in situations where there're
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
where their due process rights are
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
imperiled it's faculty members students
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
student organizations
 
02:38:20.110 --> 02:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that um are are often
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh in D in in danger in connection with
 
02:38:26.110 --> 02:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
procedures that are that are used so
 
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
let's take a look for a minute at what
 
02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
the due process rights are that this
 
02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
bill spells out and I ask you to think
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
about them and as you're thinking about
 
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
them ask yourself does this sound unfair
 
02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
is there something wrong with giving
 
02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
people who are accused of wrongdoing and
 
02:38:46.349 --> 02:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
facing suspension expulsion firing Etc
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
of these rights first notice of the
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
charges second some Advanced disclosure
 
02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
of the witnesses and evidence to be
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
presented against the person as well as
 
02:39:00.510 --> 02:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
any exculpatory evidence that favors the
 
02:39:04.429 --> 02:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
person third a presumption that the that
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
the violation did not occur and a
 
02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that the violation be proved
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
by a preponderance of the evidence and I
 
02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
should note here that that is the
 
02:39:16.230 --> 02:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence standard
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
is the Civil standard it's the lowest
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
burden of proof that we have in uh in
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
you know in the law so this is not
 
02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
making this uh these proceedings
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
analogous to criminal
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
proceedings the privilege against
 
02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
self-incrimination would apply there
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
would be a right to confront and
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
cross-examine Witnesses a right to
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
present a defense and call witnesses for
 
02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
the defense a right to an impartial
 
02:39:46.750 --> 02:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
hearing officer the the right to have a
 
02:39:49.590 --> 02:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer or a non-lawyer uh Advocate be
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
present at at the at the student or
 
02:39:54.269 --> 02:39:54.279 align:start position:0%
faculty member's expense this is not
 
02:39:57.150 --> 02:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
saying you get a right to a government
 
02:39:59.750 --> 02:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh paid for a lawyer uh but you have a
 
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
right to have one or or a non- lawyer if
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
you want to be with to be present with
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
you a right to a Verbatim record of the
 
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and a right to appeal any
 
02:40:13.309 --> 02:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
adverse decision to a higher level
 
02:40:15.870 --> 02:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
College official who was not Direct ly
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
involved in the earlier stages of the
 
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
proceedings the bill allows institutions
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
to take a mediate action prior to
 
02:40:27.870 --> 02:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
affording these rights where there is a
 
02:40:30.910 --> 02:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
threat of imminent harm and to then hold
 
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
a hearing later on once the once the
 
02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
threat has been uh
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
ameliorated colleges my the prior
 
02:40:42.030 --> 02:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
speaker indicated that um uh some of the
 
02:40:43.990 --> 02:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
co some were College administrators that
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
basically said that came in and said you
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
know our current practices are just fine
 
02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
there really is no
 
02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:52.910 align:start position:0%
there really is no
problem

02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:40:54.990 --> 02:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
interestingly one of the one of the
 
02:40:57.230 --> 02:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
groups that you would expect would be
 
02:40:58.750 --> 02:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
here would have been there in the
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
committee process if there if uh If
 
02:41:03.269 --> 02:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
there really wasn't any problem is the
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
union Representatives who represent
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
faculty members Etc to come in and say
 
02:41:10.110 --> 02:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
oh this if if we pass this bill there'll
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
be a big problem but you know what there
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
were no Union Representatives coming in
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
and saying this is going to be a problem
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
and I submit to you that's because they
 
02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
don't see it as a
 
02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
problem let me point out to you one
 
02:41:24.550 --> 02:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
thing that I think is critically
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
important the prior speaker mentioned
 
02:41:30.429 --> 02:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
that um in in that most of the
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
procedures that you that the university
 
02:41:34.429 --> 02:41:34.439 align:start position:0%
system and the community college system
 
02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
currently use really comply with this
 
02:41:39.150 --> 02:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
there's really no difference or very
 
02:41:42.590 --> 02:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
minor difference if that's really
 
02:41:44.990 --> 02:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
true then there's no problem because the
 
02:41:48.670 --> 02:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
bill specifically says that that uh
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
colleges or universities that have their
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
own procedures are completely free to
 
02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
use those as long as they afford the
 
02:41:58.910 --> 02:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
minimum due process requirements that
 
02:42:01.870 --> 02:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
are in this bill so they can keep they
 
02:42:04.349 --> 02:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
can keep doing their uh they can keep
 
02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
doing what they're doing as long as they
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:12.269 --> 02:42:12.279 align:start position:0%
process and of course one of the other
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
things that the bill also says is in
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to informally resolved
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
matters um there's no nothing in the
 
02:42:22.990 --> 02:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the bill specifically says that
 
02:42:25.309 --> 02:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
a faculty member or student is free to
 
02:42:27.910 --> 02:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
wave any of the rights as just as anyone
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
else would be that are that are afforded
 
02:42:31.630 --> 02:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
under this as long as they do so
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:38.830 --> 02:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
knowingly let me talk for a moment about
 
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
a particular problem that uh that is is
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
a basis for needing for to for me to
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
believe that that this bill is
 
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
particularly important it's the issue of
 
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
potential sexual assault allegations
 
02:42:55.630 --> 02:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
brought against students or maybe even
 
02:42:57.389 --> 02:42:57.399 align:start position:0%
faculty members probably more likely
 
02:42:59.469 --> 02:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
students as you may
 
02:43:02.670 --> 02:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
know during the abom Obama
 
02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
Administration there was what was sent
 
02:43:06.750 --> 02:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
out by the education department
 
02:43:10.190 --> 02:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
something known as guidance they weren't
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
regulations that were sort of you know
 
02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to have the legal effect of law
 
02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
they were it was referred to as
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
guidance um suggesting that that that uh
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities around the
 
02:43:27.309 --> 02:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
country were really affording too much
 
02:43:30.990 --> 02:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
due process uh in these kinds of cases
 
02:43:33.349 --> 02:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
and that it was Pro it was it would be
 
02:43:39.550 --> 02:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
okay to uh uh allow some lesser level of
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
process uh in these in these cases which
 
02:43:44.349 --> 02:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
did not really afford fairness to the to
 
02:43:47.790 --> 02:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
the person that was accused used
 
02:43:51.870 --> 02:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
um that was reversed during the during
 
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
the Trump Administration but now is in
 
02:43:56.830 --> 02:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
the process of being reinstated by the
 
02:43:58.670 --> 02:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
by the Biden
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
Administration I have to say that it is
 
02:44:03.230 --> 02:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
very discouraging to see this
 
02:44:05.710 --> 02:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
development happening in the current
 
02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:07.269 align:start position:0%
development happening in the current
Administration

02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:44:11.590 --> 02:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
um requiring fairness does not in any
 
02:44:14.269 --> 02:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
way mean that any that anything goes in
 
02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
these kinds of proceding that in these
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh due process protections that
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
are afforded by this by this uh uh
 
02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
procedure during the during the
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
committee proceedings on this matter
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
some an issue was raised about oh well
 
02:44:31.469 --> 02:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
you know if if a student is allowed to
 
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
uh to uh ask questions of of an accuser
 
02:44:38.309 --> 02:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know things could get out of
 
02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
control absolutely not there's nothing
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that in any way would
 
02:44:45.990 --> 02:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
would uh would prevent the the the
 
02:44:48.510 --> 02:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
officer conducting the hearing from from
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
shutting down something if they're try
 
02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
if if uh an accused were trying to
 
02:44:54.510 --> 02:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
harass a victim or something like that
 
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely the hearings officer could
 
02:44:58.389 --> 02:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.110 --> 02:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
down I think this is the important thing
 
02:45:02.990 --> 02:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
that is that I hope you'll consider as
 
02:45:05.230 --> 02:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
you as you debate on what as you think
 
02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
about what you what should happen on
 
02:45:10.910 --> 02:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
this bill our traditions in this country
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
and really in England going back to the
 
02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
Magna Carta
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
have always taken the view that it is
 
02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
better for 10 guilty persons to escape
 
02:45:25.389 --> 02:45:25.399 align:start position:0%
punishment than for one innocent person
 
02:45:27.870 --> 02:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:30.910 --> 02:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
convicted I hope that all of us all of
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
us in this room still believe
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
that I submit respectfully that we
 
02:45:40.389 --> 02:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
should not allow an exception to this
 
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:43.240 align:start position:0%

02:47:53.309 --> 02:47:53.319 align:start position:0%

02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
that the university and Community
 
02:48:12.349 --> 02:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
College systems of New Hampshire already
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
have wellestablished disciplinary
 
02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
systems that effectively resolve issues
 
02:48:20.830 --> 02:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
respecting both parties without
 
02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
precluding civil or criminal legal
 
02:48:26.349 --> 02:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings if needed and if I know this
 
02:48:28.750 --> 02:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill would require renegotiating many
 
02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements at
 
02:48:32.750 --> 02:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
considerable time and
 
02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
expense and more importantly if I know
 
02:48:39.230 --> 02:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
as a survivor of assault that allowing
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
the cross-examination of the alleged
 
02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
perpetrator without the safety of
 
02:48:45.790 --> 02:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
official court procedur procures is
 
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
likely to cause further trauma to
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
victims and if I know that this bill
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
discourages victims from seeking help or
 
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
reporting assaults would I now press the
 
02:48:58.950 --> 02:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
red button so a better motion can be
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%

morning if I know that this bill
 
02:49:22.429 --> 02:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
establishes a basic level of due process
 
02:49:25.229 --> 02:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
if I further know that if colleges
 
02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
already meet these basic requirements
 
02:49:31.590 --> 02:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
they must do nothing further but if I
 
02:49:33.910 --> 02:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
know that it was confirmed to our
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%

luno thank you Mr
 
02:52:05.309 --> 02:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker House Bill 1517 would reduce the
 
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax by the
 
02:52:10.030 --> 02:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue collected from the
 
02:52:12.469 --> 02:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
state from what are called games of
 
02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
chance and only in the amount ount of
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
that that would exceed $6.6
 
02:52:21.309 --> 02:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
million so where' that come from that's
 
02:52:23.150 --> 02:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
the amount collected by the state last
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
year from games of chance the fiscal
 
02:52:28.429 --> 02:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
note on the bill says it's unclear
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
whether revenue from games of chance
 
02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
would ex would ever exceed $6.6 million
 
02:52:37.429 --> 02:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
in future years but fair to say it's not
 
02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to put a big dent in the Statewide
 
02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
education property tax the state reduced
 
02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
the swept by $100 million a few years
 
02:52:47.309 --> 02:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
ago and even that didn't make much of a
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
difference for most taxpayers there are
 
02:52:52.590 --> 02:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
other bills to take up to reform the
 
02:52:55.469 --> 02:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax and I'd
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
suggest that we place our attention
 
02:52:59.510 --> 02:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
there let's vote against the motion of
 
02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this bill so that we
 
02:53:03.630 --> 02:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
can focus on the other bills thank you
 
02:53:06.389 --> 02:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
and I request a division vote J
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr thank you Mr
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker um
 
02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is simply a bill that's trying
 
02:53:19.469 --> 02:53:19.479 align:start position:0%
to avoid growing government because we
 
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
have new revenues uh I think anybody
 
02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
who's watched the 6:00 news sees that
 
02:53:26.269 --> 02:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
woman jumping up and down in the ads all
 
02:53:28.590 --> 02:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
the time saying how white her gamly
 
02:53:30.910 --> 02:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
casinos are you've seen the ads for the
 
02:53:33.269 --> 02:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
Nashua Casino you've seen the one in
 
02:53:35.389 --> 02:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
Conway that just I just recently been
 
02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
approved and so this is not talk we're
 
02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
not talking about the you know having
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
the these gamblings in the church
 
02:53:43.870 --> 02:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
basement like we did some years ago
 
02:53:45.630 --> 02:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about thousands of slot
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
machines are going to be in New
 
02:53:48.349 --> 02:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're talking about table
 
02:53:50.030 --> 02:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
limits going to
 
02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
$50 and a lot more casinos there's going
 
02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be a lot more revenue from these uh
 
02:53:57.429 --> 02:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
from this gambling and what the purpose
 
02:53:59.830 --> 02:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to use that to reduce a
 
02:54:02.670 --> 02:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
liability that the state already has now
 
02:54:05.469 --> 02:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
the bill says Statewide property tax but
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on taxes so my goal is
 
02:54:09.750 --> 02:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
to get this to ways and means and I
 
02:54:11.550 --> 02:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
would defer to the Judgment maybe as
 
02:54:13.870 --> 02:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
someone suggested we could use it to pay
 
02:54:15.950 --> 02:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
down some of the retirement debt which
 
02:54:18.190 --> 02:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
was which is in I think billions of
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and um it would be uh save
 
02:54:24.110 --> 02:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
everybody money that way the main
 
02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
purpose is not to expand government
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
because we're getting new revenues from
 
02:54:30.309 --> 02:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
gaming if you look to our South in
 
02:54:31.950 --> 02:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
Connecticut they put in gaming some
 
02:54:34.990 --> 02:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
years ago with new casinos at one time
 
02:54:36.510 --> 02:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
there were people lined up three and
 
02:54:38.710 --> 02:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
four deep just waiting to get a seat at
 
02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
the blackjack table then the recession
 
02:54:42.830 --> 02:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
came and all of a sudden those revenues
 
02:54:44.510 --> 02:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
dropped drastically off but the new
 
02:54:46.590 --> 02:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
programs they put in hadn't they had to
 
02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
put in massive tax increases and that's
 
02:54:50.950 --> 02:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to avoid with this we
 
02:54:52.990 --> 02:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to use this enhanced Revenue
 
02:54:55.190 --> 02:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to come in to create new
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
programs because yeah we're going to
 
02:54:58.710 --> 02:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of revenue for a
 
02:55:00.190 --> 02:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
while but eventually gambling is going
 
02:55:02.429 --> 02:55:02.439 align:start position:0%
to be saturated it's going to level off
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
and if you re have another recession
 
02:55:06.229 --> 02:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
which is bound to happen sometime
 
02:55:08.429 --> 02:55:08.439 align:start position:0%
gambling is a total voluntary spending
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's one of the first things people will
 
02:55:13.349 --> 02:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
cut out if they are short on money so
 
02:55:15.910 --> 02:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking you to say let's not use
 
02:55:18.150 --> 02:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
this new Revenue source to expand
 
02:55:19.990 --> 02:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
government and if it's as small as the
 
02:55:21.950 --> 02:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
former speaker just said then what's to
 
02:55:24.670 --> 02:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
worry there's no new spending in this
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
and there I mean there's no new
 
02:55:28.030 --> 02:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation we're not cutting any
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
programs we're just saying let's be
 
02:55:32.110 --> 02:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
prudent about this increased money and
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
use it to reduce a liability that the
 
02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
state already has rather than create new
 
02:55:39.389 --> 02:55:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
you representative luno has requested a
 
02:55:47.710 --> 02:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:49.870 --> 02:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
instead of rolling Harrington requests a
 
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently that is
 
02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:43.070 align:start position:0%

02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is aut to pass on
 
02:57:10.510 --> 02:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 157 this is a roll call vote
 
02:57:12.269 --> 02:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative berer for
 
02:57:20.950 --> 02:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I question the notion that
 
02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
the Statewide property tax should depend
 
02:57:32.349 --> 02:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
upon the gaming industry as a source of
 
02:57:32.359 --> 02:57:33.429 align:start position:0%
upon the gaming industry as a source of
school

02:57:33.429 --> 02:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:57:36.110 --> 02:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
funding and if I know that the Statewide
 
02:57:39.790 --> 02:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
property tax is currently under scrutiny
 
02:57:42.269 --> 02:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
with several committees and pending
 
02:57:45.870 --> 02:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
legislation due to the recent court case
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
if I know that two years ago we reduced
 
02:57:53.070 --> 02:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
the swep by $100 million which resulted
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
in marginal property tax relief across
 
02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:56.550 align:start position:0%
in marginal property tax relief across
the

02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:56.560 align:start position:0%

02:58:01.269 --> 02:58:01.279 align:start position:0%

fellow members for allowing me to move
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
this back so I was able to speak on this
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
bill I have to say this is a the same
 
04:31:19.870 --> 04:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
old song we've heard many many times in
 
04:31:22.510 --> 04:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
the past let's bury a hidden tax and
 
04:31:24.510 --> 04:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
electric rates and never tell the
 
04:31:26.469 --> 04:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
electric rate payers about it they won't
 
04:31:28.269 --> 04:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
know they're paying more for electricity
 
04:31:29.790 --> 04:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
because of this hidden tax that's going
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
to use to subsidize electric vehicles
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
and even if they recognize that their
 
04:31:34.990 --> 04:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
rates are going up they're just going to
 
04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
blame the electric elect company it's a
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
real sweet deal for those people who
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
believe in Hidden taxes and
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
non-transparency in government so
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
where's the money coming from it's
 
04:31:46.590 --> 04:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
coming from Reggie Reggie's the regional
 
04:31:48.750 --> 04:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative that's been in
 
04:31:51.309 --> 04:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
effect for a few years what it does is
 
04:31:53.870 --> 04:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
it penalizes everybody who's a carbon
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
dioxide emitter so they have to pay a
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
penalty into the electric markets and
 
04:32:01.750 --> 04:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
then these penalties in the form of uh
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
coupons are auctioned off and the
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
results of those auctions minus the
 
04:32:07.309 --> 04:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
administrative cost and so forth the
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
return to the States now in New
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unlike most States almost all
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
of that money is returned to the rate
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
payers so the rate payers who paid the
 
04:32:16.830 --> 04:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
extra money because of the higher
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
electric wholesale electric rates get
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
their money back what this bill says is
 
04:32:23.790 --> 04:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
let's not give them all their money back
 
04:32:25.550 --> 04:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
let's take some of that money and use it
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
to spend on subsidies for people to buy
 
04:32:28.239 --> 04:32:29.269 align:start position:0%
to spend on subsidies for people to buy
electric

04:32:29.269 --> 04:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
electric
 
04:32:31.349 --> 04:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles and you're going to hear
 
04:32:33.149 --> 04:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
different levels the first time it was
 
04:32:35.189 --> 04:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
you could make up to $300,000 now you're
 
04:32:36.510 --> 04:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
going to make make only
 
04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
$150,000 but the fact remains is the
 
04:32:41.189 --> 04:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
average income of the person who buys an
 
04:32:44.590 --> 04:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
EV is over $100,000 a year where the
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
average mean household income of New
 
04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is about 78,000 and that means
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
well over half the people in New
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
households in New Hampshire couldn't
 
04:32:55.309 --> 04:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
afford an electric vehicle think about
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
it if you're making $78,000 are you
 
04:33:00.590 --> 04:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
going to spend $50,000 on a new car of
 
04:33:02.149 --> 04:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
course you're not you couldn't afford to
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
do it so this is sort of a reverse Robin
 
04:33:07.029 --> 04:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
Hood situation where the people that
 
04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
have sufficient amount of money to buy
 
04:33:10.109 --> 04:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicle are going to be
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the people who
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
don't it just doesn't make any sense and
 
04:33:18.789 --> 04:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
remember Federal uh governments already
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
Federal taxpayers are already
 
04:33:22.269 --> 04:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
subsidizing EVS to the tune of thousands
 
04:33:25.109 --> 04:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
of dollars so we simply don't need
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
another secret tax in our electric bills
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
if you really believe in what you're
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
doing and we should subsidize electric
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles put it out there in public and
 
04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
say you're going to tax something where
 
04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what they're being
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
charged and what it's going to don't
 
04:33:41.709 --> 04:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
hide it in electric bills and finally if
 
04:33:45.150 --> 04:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
EVS are so spectacular and so wonderful
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
why do we have to bribe people to buy
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
them why do we have to subsidize them
 
04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
they should be willing to do it on their
 
04:33:52.910 --> 04:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
own please vote against this amendment

04:34:19.230 --> 04:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
in favor of the uh Amendment uh 0506 H
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
as originally introduced HB
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
1472 called for the establishment of a
 
04:34:27.070 --> 04:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
2-year electric vehicle rebate pilot
 
04:34:29.789 --> 04:34:29.799 align:start position:0%
program during discussions within the
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
which there was General agreement among
 
04:34:36.629 --> 04:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
our members that to consider moving
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
forward we needed more specific program
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines and guard rails and this
 
04:34:44.910 --> 04:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
amendment does that the amendment
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
clarifies that a total of $3 million
 
04:34:50.349 --> 04:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
will be allocated to the pilot program
 
04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
over a two-year period 1.5 million in
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
year 1 and an additional 1.5 million in
 
04:34:59.310 --> 04:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
year two it delays the start of the
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
program until July 1st of 2025 so that
 
04:35:04.510 --> 04:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
has ample time to set up the program and
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment confirms the original
 
04:35:12.230 --> 04:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill as introduced that
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million set aside for the pilot
 
04:35:18.109 --> 04:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
program each year should come from the
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 to $40 million provided
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire each year from the
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%

federal program and they were included
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
in the amendment to maximize the

and lessers of

Speaker if I know that this amendment
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
makes a good bill much better and if I
 
04:40:50.670 --> 04:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
know that New Hampshire receives between
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
30 and $40 million annually as our share
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
of regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
04:40:57.750 --> 04:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
allowances and these Reggie funds are
 
04:40:59.550 --> 04:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
not collected from New Hampshire rate
 
04:41:01.868 --> 04:41:01.878 align:start position:0%
payers if I know that these Reggie funds
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
are intended to be used by New Hampshire
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
for strategic energy
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
purposes and if I further know that 1.5
 
04:41:10.470 --> 04:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
million per year of that 30 to 40
 
04:41:12.510 --> 04:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
million in Reggie funds from power
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
plants will be reallocated from pennies
 
04:41:18.110 --> 04:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
worth of monthly electric rebates to
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
fund this electric vehicle rebate pilot
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
program and if I further know that this
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
pilot rebate program would keep Reggie
 
04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
rebate money in New Hampshire as opposed
 
04:41:30.030 --> 04:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
to directing it to our energy utility
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
companies and benefit not only those low
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%

04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
wish to purchase an electric vehicle but
 
04:41:40.110 --> 04:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
also local businesses and if I know that
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
all of the New England states except for
 
04:41:44.430 --> 04:41:44.440 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:45:26.590 --> 04:45:26.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that New Hampshire
 
04:45:29.070 --> 04:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
receives representative my
 
04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
mistake is he's
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
first my mistake I'm sorry thank you Mr
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker recognize representative
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
Harington for a parliamentary in Mr
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know there's only one
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
source of Reggie funds and that's the
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
rate payers of the regie states if I
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
know there's no magical uh source of
 
04:45:48.430 --> 04:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
money in the sky that every single penny
 
04:45:50.510 --> 04:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
of Reggie money comes from higher rates
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
paid by the rate payers and if I know
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill would use that rate payer
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
money instead of re refunding it to the
 
04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
rate payers who paid it would use it to
 
04:46:01.868 --> 04:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
subsidize so affluent people could buy
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
yes now the chair recognize
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative mons for a parliamentary
 
04:46:13.470 --> 04:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
inir thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:46:15.788 --> 04:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire receives approximately 33
 
04:46:17.190 --> 04:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
million as its share of the regional
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative allowances
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
collected from Power producers across
 
04:46:24.110 --> 04:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
the 10 eastern states and that 1.5
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
million of that would be reallocated to
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
the pilot program envisioned in hp1
 
04:46:33.390 --> 04:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
1472 and that that 1.5 million would
 
04:46:35.948 --> 04:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
reduce the direct bill assistance uh to
 
04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
the average energy consumer in New
 
04:46:40.830 --> 04:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by about 17 cents per month
 
04:46:42.990 --> 04:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
per customer and if I know that the
 
04:46:44.548 --> 04:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
pilot rebate program would keep that
 
04:46:46.470 --> 04:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
money in New Hampshire and benefit not
 
04:46:47.868 --> 04:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
only those who wish to purchase an
 
04:46:50.190 --> 04:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle but also local
 
04:46:53.230 --> 04:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
businesses and if I know that when HP
 
04:46:55.830 --> 04:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
1472 is implemented Electric New

Speaker uh we've gone through some
 
04:49:19.628 --> 04:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
discussion already because we we were
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
involved with the amendment but uh I'm
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:49:26.110 --> 04:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
address I'm going to address the the
 
04:49:26.120 --> 04:49:27.830 align:start position:0%
address I'm going to address the the
original

04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:49:31.470 --> 04:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
bill as you've heard HB 1472 would
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
introduce a special New Hampshire
 
04:49:37.070 --> 04:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
subsidy for the purchase of electric
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles in addition to the existing

Federal
 
04:49:44.590 --> 04:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
subsidies so a little background here
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicle tax credit was
 
04:49:48.110 --> 04:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
first introduced as part of the energy
 
04:49:52.150 --> 04:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
Policy Act of 2005 as a way to
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
encourage the production and Adoption of

electric
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
vehicles and established a Federal
 
04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
income tax credit of up to 3,400 for the
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
purchase of new hybrid vehicles in 2009
 
04:50:05.150 --> 04:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
the American recovery and reinvestment
 
04:50:06.830 --> 04:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
act expanded the credit to include
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
plug-in electric vehicles and increased
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.628 --> 04:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
$7,500 even if you think promoting EVS
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
is good
 
04:50:21.310 --> 04:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
policy how long do we need to keep quote
 
04:50:21.320 --> 04:50:22.708 align:start position:0%
policy how long do we need to keep quote

04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%

04:50:25.470 --> 04:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
them we have been priming the pump so to
 
04:50:28.110 --> 04:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
speak for almost 20
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
years the richest man in the world sells
 
04:50:35.910 --> 04:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
EVS does he he really deserve more
 
04:50:39.150 --> 04:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
help in addition a cheating scandal was
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%

from an erroneous interpretation by the

04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
legality of the

million from these credits just in 2023
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%

their overall net
 
04:51:50.990 --> 04:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
income ultimately this money comes from
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
those people who purchase gasoline
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
powered vehicles in the form of higher
 
04:51:58.470 --> 04:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
prices clearly the federal
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
Administration really really wants you
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
to buy
 
04:52:06.788 --> 04:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
EVS HB 1472 does not provide a tax
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
credit but a direct payment of
 
04:52:11.788 --> 04:52:11.798 align:start position:0%
$2,000 on the purchase of a battery EV
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
and $1,000 for a plugin hybrid
 
04:52:16.708 --> 04:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
EV this money we've heard a lot about
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
this but this money will come from
 
04:52:20.548 --> 04:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
electricity rate
 
04:52:23.230 --> 04:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
payers a fairness issue was brought up
 
04:52:26.270 --> 04:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
in committee it was suggested that one
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
effect of these programs is to transfer
 
04:52:30.670 --> 04:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
money from workingclass people to
 
04:52:30.680 --> 04:52:31.948 align:start position:0%
money from workingclass people to
well-paid

04:52:31.948 --> 04:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
well-paid
 
04:52:34.430 --> 04:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
professionals who might find EV is fun
 
04:52:37.030 --> 04:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
or useful or be a way to demonstrate
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
their concern for the
 
04:52:41.788 --> 04:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
environment that argument did carry some
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
weight with the supporters of the bill
 
04:52:46.590 --> 04:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment we were just discussing uh
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
was the outcome of that discussion where
 
04:52:50.750 --> 04:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
the upper annual income bounds for
 
04:52:52.510 --> 04:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
qualification for the program were
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
lowered from
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.030 --> 04:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
$150,000 okay all citizens of the US are
 
04:53:03.868 --> 04:53:03.878 align:start position:0%
currently paying for the Federal
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
subsidies for
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
EVS do we want to burden the rap payers
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire with an additional
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
handout for the purchasers of
 
04:53:17.110 --> 04:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
EVS they are already getting 7500 plus
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
hidden subsidies like the one I just
 
04:53:21.628 --> 04:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
talked about do we want the people of
 
04:53:25.390 --> 04:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
this state to contribute another
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
$2,000 if you think this is outrageous
 
04:53:29.948 --> 04:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
or at least uh
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
unjustified please vote no on OTP so a
 
04:53:37.150 --> 04:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
different motion can be made thank you
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:53.948 --> 04:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you Mr
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker while the amendment would have
 
04:53:58.190 --> 04:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
made this a better tailored bill for low
 
04:54:00.310 --> 04:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
and middle- inome families the
 
04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is still worth carrying
 
04:54:05.590 --> 04:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
forward this bill creates a 2-year pilot
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
using Reggie funds which are intended to
 
04:54:11.788 --> 04:54:11.798 align:start position:0%
be used to advance energy policy in New
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this cash on the hoods program
 
04:54:15.708 --> 04:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
is designed to provide point of sale
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle rebates to EV buyers
 
04:54:23.350 --> 04:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles used hybrid and electric
 
04:54:27.670 --> 04:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles are rapidly gaining traction as
 
04:54:29.948 --> 04:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
first vehicles for new teenage drivers
 
04:54:32.110 --> 04:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire these are workingclass
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
families purchasing a local car for
 
04:54:37.350 --> 04:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
their kid to drive around town the pilot
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
program offers Granite Staters the same
 
04:54:41.430 --> 04:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities as the states around us
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
including Maine Vermont Massachusetts
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Rhode Island that all
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
offer state-based EV rebate programs
 
04:54:50.948 --> 04:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
with similar incentives the funding for
 
04:54:52.470 --> 04:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
this program comes out of the total
 
04:54:54.070 --> 04:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
funds that are presently slated to be
 
04:54:56.190 --> 04:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
rebated to individual electric rate
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
payers during the same period as the
 
04:55:00.430 --> 04:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
pilot program the reduction of the
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
average New Hampshire residential
 
04:55:03.628 --> 04:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
electric consumer Reggie rebate will be
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
pennies per customer per month for this

amount of carbon emitted by new and used
 
04:55:38.948 --> 04:55:38.958 align:start position:0%
vehicles on our roads this will provide
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that every
 
04:57:28.230 --> 04:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
rate payer in New England in the iso New
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
England territory pays for Reggie in the
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
cost of their electricity
 
04:57:37.070 --> 04:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
and then get some of that back via a
 
04:57:37.080 --> 04:57:38.190 align:start position:0%
and then get some of that back via a
Reggie

04:57:38.190 --> 04:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
Reggie
 
04:57:41.110 --> 04:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
rebate in New Hampshire it's about 10%
 
04:57:43.150 --> 04:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:57:46.590 --> 04:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
total if I also know that this bill
 
04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
increases electricity costs in order to
 
04:57:53.110 --> 04:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
give rebates to EV buyers who mostly
 
04:57:57.788 --> 04:57:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
and if I know that increased electricity
 
04:58:04.230 --> 04:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
costs affect low income citizens more
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
than all
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
others and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
that EV prices are falling right now and
 
04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
will soon be comparable to non-ev
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
Vehicles thus negating the new the need
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
for any incentives or
 
04:58:25.628 --> 04:58:25.638 align:start position:0%
rebates would I now press the red button
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%

04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%

04:58:49.948 --> 04:58:49.958 align:start position:0%

States and if I know that the original
 
04:59:00.430 --> 04:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of Reggie was to provide States
 
04:59:02.670 --> 04:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire with funds to make
 
04:59:06.030 --> 04:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
Strate iic investments in our Energy
 
04:59:08.590 --> 04:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
Future and if I know that the 3 million
 
04:59:11.150 --> 04:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
to be invested in this program will
 
04:59:13.270 --> 04:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
accre to the benefit of all New
 
04:59:15.788 --> 04:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and assist in that
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
transition and if I know that those at
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
the lower end of the income Spectrum are
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
the ones in most need of additional
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
incentives and if I know that the that a
 
04:59:31.470 --> 04:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
used EV plug-in EV vehicle can be
 
04:59:33.868 --> 04:59:33.878 align:start position:0%
purchased for as low as
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
$10,000 which is certainly affordable
 
04:59:39.430 --> 04:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
for people in the lower income uh
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%

something
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive more funding is not the

solution more funding is the
 
05:07:58.230 --> 05:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
problem it's the problem because how
 
05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
these funds are being
 
05:08:02.990 --> 05:08:03.000 align:start position:0%

schools the path forward to a genuinely
 
05:08:24.670 --> 05:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
adequate education requires reversing

05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%

staff and returning to
 
05:08:39.230 --> 05:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
academics the exorbitant funding is the
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
problem not the solution because schools
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
have demonstrated time and time again
 
05:08:47.788 --> 05:08:47.798 align:start position:0%
that when we fund them in excess of what
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
is necessary to deliver an adequate
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
education they will use those funds on
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
programs that are objectively harmful to
 
05:08:55.280 --> 05:08:57.548 align:start position:0%
programs that are objectively harmful to
their

05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
mission as to the Judiciary some would
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
make the argument that we have to meet
 
05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
them halfway
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
here my message is that our job here is
 
05:09:10.430 --> 05:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
not to count out to the Judiciary our
 
05:09:12.910 --> 05:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
job is to secure the powers of this
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
legislature as delegated To Us by the
 
05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution this is a political issue
 
05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
and this is the political body where
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
you g recognized representative
 
05:09:31.120 --> 05:09:39.948 align:start position:0%
you g recognized representative
lad

05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:42.270 --> 05:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr
 
05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
Speaker about a month
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
ago we had these four bills which
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're all Finance bills dealing with
 
05:09:52.910 --> 05:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
the adequacy funding formula come to
 
05:09:55.430 --> 05:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
education policy and I went to
 
05:09:57.470 --> 05:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
leadership and said look if we want to
 
05:09:59.788 --> 05:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
do this properly we need to have a
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee put together that involves
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
folks not just from education
 
05:10:08.590 --> 05:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
policy and Leadership working on both
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle here with the
 
05:10:13.548 --> 05:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
minority leader and the
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
speaker told me to develop a
 
05:10:20.350 --> 05:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that had 10 people on it
 
05:10:24.190 --> 05:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
two from Ways and Means two from finance
 
05:10:27.628 --> 05:10:27.638 align:start position:0%
and six from policy my modern math says
 
05:10:27.638 --> 05:10:28.590 align:start position:0%
and six from policy my modern math says
that's

05:10:28.590 --> 05:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:10:34.110 --> 05:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
10 and of the 10 five five Republicans
 
05:10:37.548 --> 05:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
and five Democrats so we truly have a
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan recommendation that came back
 
05:10:40.708 --> 05:10:40.718 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:10:42.548 --> 05:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or back from the
 
05:10:44.548 --> 05:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to the education policy
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee and forward with this amending
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
language we were tasked with the
 
05:10:53.910 --> 05:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of looking at the
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
formation of a funding
 
05:10:59.708 --> 05:10:59.718 align:start position:0%
formula that would meet the needs of the
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
state and analyze previous funding
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
formulas developed as far back as 2008
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
in the estherbrook study in the 2018
 
05:11:14.310 --> 05:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
under the um umberger study and again in
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
2020 with the commission which we had to
 
05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
look at the foundation budget
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
formula we started off with this bill
 
05:11:25.868 --> 05:11:25.878 align:start position:0%
because this bill addresses a singular
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
issue when we were provided it base cost
 
05:11:32.350 --> 05:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
what is the base cost per pupil in
 
05:11:32.360 --> 05:11:33.788 align:start position:0%
what is the base cost per pupil in
inadequate

05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
education we know based upon what we had
 
05:11:37.280 --> 05:11:39.350 align:start position:0%
education we know based upon what we had
in

05:11:39.350 --> 05:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:44.480 --> 05:11:46.910 align:start position:0%
 
$3,456

05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
$3,456
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
3456 and in 2018 it became
 
05:11:51.840 --> 05:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
3456 and in 2018 it became
3,363

05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
3,363
 
05:11:57.030 --> 05:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
$36 and more recently right now the base
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.878 --> 05:12:03.548 align:start position:0%
 
$4,180

05:12:03.548 --> 05:12:03.558 align:start position:0%
$4,180
 
05:12:06.750 --> 05:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
so we were trying to figure out what is
 
05:12:11.190 --> 05:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
then the average minimum average salary
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
for a teacher here in the state of New
 
05:12:15.350 --> 05:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because that is part of per
 
05:12:20.788 --> 05:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
pupil base cost back in 2008 the salary
 
05:12:22.270 --> 05:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
of a teacher was
 
05:12:22.280 --> 05:12:25.230 align:start position:0%
of a teacher was
$33,860

05:12:25.230 --> 05:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
$33,860
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a whole lot different what I heard
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
from the representative from straford
 
05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
here saying it was 78,000
 
05:12:34.830 --> 05:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
now is the average medium income or
 
05:12:37.270 --> 05:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
income for a person in the state today
 
05:12:40.110 --> 05:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
so we went to work and said okay we need
 
05:12:42.270 --> 05:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
to find out what the average salary is
 
05:12:46.390 --> 05:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
right now we went to doe and got a
 
05:12:49.470 --> 05:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet on every District in this
 
05:12:52.628 --> 05:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
state what is the minimum salary it
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
varies tremendously throughout this
 
05:12:57.190 --> 05:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
state you have some communities where
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
the minimum salary is over
 
05:13:00.760 --> 05:13:02.430 align:start position:0%
the minimum salary is over
$60,000

05:13:02.430 --> 05:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
$60,000
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
you have others that have 51 to
 
05:13:08.948 --> 05:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
$58,000 but then you have a few not a
 
05:13:11.868 --> 05:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
few quite a few and I'm in one of those
 
05:13:14.190 --> 05:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
towns and people in the North Country
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:22.030 --> 05:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
$31,000 now if you're a young person
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
coming out of unh Keane or Plymouth with
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
a degree in teaching and it's hard to
 
05:13:29.310 --> 05:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
find them now seeing that many people
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
are not wanting to go into the
 
05:13:32.230 --> 05:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
profession of teaching because there's
 
05:13:34.270 --> 05:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
no income there to support them in their
 
05:13:34.280 --> 05:13:35.990 align:start position:0%
no income there to support them in their
daily

05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
daily
 
05:13:39.430 --> 05:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
life and so those programs are putting
 
05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
out fewer and fewer teachers that are
 
05:13:44.030 --> 05:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
prepared to teach in our schools today
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
and our population though is
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
declining when I first got on board here
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
in the house we had over 210,000
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
students in the state K through 12 we're
 
05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
down to 154,000
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
now so what we have to do we looked at
 
05:14:02.990 --> 05:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
that and we determined that the average
 
05:14:04.708 --> 05:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
minimum salary for a teacher in this
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
42,5 60 that's the figure we used so
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
then we went back to the formula that's
 
05:14:17.470 --> 05:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
in the base cost as generated in the
 
05:14:20.430 --> 05:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
esterbrook study back in 2008 where you
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
have a base cost and you have a what the
 
05:14:25.470 --> 05:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
cost is the what we call the universal
 
05:14:29.350 --> 05:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
cost for K through 2 and then grades 3
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
through 12 we Chang K through two we
 
05:14:35.628 --> 05:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
felt it should be K through three where
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
the pupil teacher ratio is 25
 
05:14:42.150 --> 05:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
to1 and then for grades 4 through 12
 
05:14:45.030 --> 05:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's 30 to1 now I know a lot of
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
districts aren't there the average is
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
probably closer to 16 to 171 but that's
 
05:14:52.270 --> 05:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
not the state's decision making that's a
 
05:14:54.030 --> 05:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
local decision as to what they're doing
 
05:14:56.670 --> 05:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of Staffing in their schools
 
05:14:59.110 --> 05:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
but when we added that in the cost of a
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
salary today or what the average is and
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
also the other factors which are part of
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
that per pupil base cost including
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
instruction maintenance Transportation
 
05:15:12.868 --> 05:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
instructional supplies Media Services
 
05:15:16.110 --> 05:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
technology Services Counseling Services
 
05:15:19.030 --> 05:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of a principal we found out
 
05:15:21.868 --> 05:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
that that base cost the universal cost
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
$444 that is
 
05:15:29.390 --> 05:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
$222 more than what we're paying right
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
now and when you look at the cost over
 
05:15:34.510 --> 05:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
what the we're paying for base costs in
 
05:15:36.910 --> 05:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
our adequacy formula right
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
now there is an increase of course there
 
05:15:43.230 --> 05:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
going to be an increase the increase is
 
05:15:45.788 --> 05:15:45.798 align:start position:0%
$ 34.3
 
05:15:49.390 --> 05:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
million that in terms of a Educational
 
05:15:51.150 --> 05:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
Funding which we're talking in the
 
05:15:55.150 --> 05:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
billions is small stuff but we need to
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
start moving forward and analyzing what
 
05:16:00.590 --> 05:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing with our education formula
 
05:16:03.070 --> 05:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of adade
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
and I feel right now that we brought
 
05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
forward a reasonable step to move
 
05:16:12.310 --> 05:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
forward with adequacy funding in the
 
05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
state you know there's issues going on
 
05:16:18.310 --> 05:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
outside now in the other branch of
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
government and we know that there's
 
05:16:23.110 --> 05:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
other sides of the formula besides base
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
cost on the right hand side the base
 
05:16:29.310 --> 05:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
cost is what every student in the state
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
receives regardless of the community
 
05:16:33.310 --> 05:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
wealth or poverty that they may be
 
05:16:36.350 --> 05:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
living in same thing with differentiated
 
05:16:39.548 --> 05:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
Aid as well but beyond that on the grant
 
05:16:42.030 --> 05:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
side that's how we make up or try to
 
05:16:45.628 --> 05:16:45.638 align:start position:0%
make up the differences with how we work
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
with those small school districts or
 
05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
those districts which are poverty Laden
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
that have significant
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
challenges economy a scale so we've also
 
05:16:59.310 --> 05:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
included within this package here funds
 
05:17:03.070 --> 05:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
to support those schools districts and
 
05:17:05.230 --> 05:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
that is a grant program and you can see
 
05:17:07.230 --> 05:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
that in the in the report there one of
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
those programs is based off of poverty
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
and for those schools that have up to
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
48% or more poverty in this school I.E
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester I.E
 
05:17:24.590 --> 05:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
Berlin and those down to 12% will
 
05:17:28.030 --> 05:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
receive support for those
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
schools changing things are changing in
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
education today today and yes I know
 
05:17:35.230 --> 05:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
there's areas that I've dealt with in
 
05:17:36.990 --> 05:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
the education policy committee which I'm
 
05:17:39.990 --> 05:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
not pleased with hearing what's going on
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you I've been in a number
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
of classrooms and a number of schools
 
05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
the majority the vast majority of the
 
05:17:49.230 --> 05:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
Educators out there truly want to help
 
05:17:49.240 --> 05:17:50.590 align:start position:0%
Educators out there truly want to help
the

05:17:50.590 --> 05:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:52.750 --> 05:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
children and they want to get these
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
basic skills into the kids but we're
 
05:17:58.548 --> 05:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
also dealing with numerous issues in the
 
05:18:01.110 --> 05:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
state which we have to deal with one of
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
which is if you're in in Manchester
 
05:18:05.788 --> 05:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
right now they have a social worker in
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
all their schools they have to have that
 
05:18:10.350 --> 05:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
due to the situation the social skills
 
05:18:12.430 --> 05:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
kids are arriving with so in conclusion
 
05:18:13.750 --> 05:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap it up I know we have other
 
05:18:15.270 --> 05:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
bills coming at us that are dealing with
 
05:18:15.280 --> 05:18:16.270 align:start position:0%
bills coming at us that are dealing with
this

05:18:16.270 --> 05:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:18:19.750 --> 05:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
issue this this part of our our plan
 
05:18:21.548 --> 05:18:21.558 align:start position:0%
here to move forward we need to get it
 
05:18:23.590 --> 05:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
to finance where they can work the
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
figures out we have data to show and
 
05:18:29.070 --> 05:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
reflect why we have recommended what we
 
05:18:31.948 --> 05:18:31.958 align:start position:0%
are so I'd be pleased to work with them
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
but I urge this body to forward this
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill to the finance folks division two
 
05:18:41.548 --> 05:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
so we can move forward thank you very
 
05:18:43.990 --> 05:18:44.000 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that New Hampshire

currently funds
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:20:59.948 --> 05:20:59.958 align:start position:0%
the state school funding formula is a is
 
05:21:02.230 --> 05:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
unfair to students and property
 
05:21:04.470 --> 05:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and if I know that this bill
 
05:21:06.910 --> 05:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
helps districts reduce property taxes
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
and provide better opportunities for
 
05:21:11.070 --> 05:21:11.080 align:start position:0%

science when we bring forth bills to try
 
05:25:28.150 --> 05:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
to fix this you have parents you have
 
05:25:30.910 --> 05:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
students showing up and they talk talk
 
05:25:34.628 --> 05:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
about outcomes and special ed services
 
05:25:34.638 --> 05:25:36.548 align:start position:0%
about outcomes and special ed services
and

05:25:36.548 --> 05:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
bullying the other side the government
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
education side talks about money money
 
05:25:47.708 --> 05:25:47.718 align:start position:0%
money money and
 
05:25:50.430 --> 05:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
money so the point of this
 
05:25:53.788 --> 05:25:53.798 align:start position:0%
bill was to try to speak that language
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
money so the idea is we want proficiency
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
we want good outcomes
 
05:26:05.670 --> 05:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
so the idea is you get your money when
 
05:26:06.868 --> 05:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
we get our
 
05:26:10.110 --> 05:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
proficiency we will pay for
 
05:26:13.628 --> 05:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
that schools every year every year we
 
05:26:15.310 --> 05:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
give more money to the
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
schools and yet we haven't seen good
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
outcomes why is that perhaps schools
 
05:26:25.868 --> 05:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
aren't focusing and what they need to be
 
05:26:25.878 --> 05:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
aren't focusing and what they need to be
focusing

05:26:27.990 --> 05:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
focusing
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
on I'll use as an example government
 
05:26:33.510 --> 05:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
Governor Wentworth Regional School
 
05:26:37.110 --> 05:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
District they recently did a whole
 
05:26:39.628 --> 05:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
Retreat and everything to try to figure
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
out what they needed to be focusing on
 
05:26:44.628 --> 05:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
and to come up with a plan of attack
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
number one student wellness number two
 
05:26:52.510 --> 05:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
culture of Wellness number three family
 
05:26:54.510 --> 05:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
and Community communication and
 
05:26:58.350 --> 05:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
engagement and finally number four
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
academic achievement so those first ones
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to start working on right
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
now finally the and 26 and 27 they're
 
05:27:14.150 --> 05:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:16.548 --> 05:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
academics you look at what schools are
 
05:27:18.788 --> 05:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
spending their money on as you heard
 
05:27:23.628 --> 05:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
before we have Dei seal Wellness
 
05:27:26.070 --> 05:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
administrators they make twice as much
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
money as the teachers
 
05:27:31.070 --> 05:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
do how about if we don't hire them how
 
05:27:32.430 --> 05:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
about if we give more money to the
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
teachers how about if we hire math
 
05:27:38.030 --> 05:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
Specialists and reading Specialists
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
instead teachers work
 
05:27:45.430 --> 05:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
hard but they work in a way that isn't
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
working because they have to pay
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
attention to what those administrators
 
05:27:51.948 --> 05:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
are telling them to
 
05:27:54.590 --> 05:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
do they're not looking at what the
 
05:27:56.548 --> 05:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
science is for reading no they're
 
05:27:59.548 --> 05:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
teaching an outdated method that is
 
05:28:01.670 --> 05:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually harmful to
 
05:28:03.948 --> 05:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
learning they use calculators for
 
05:28:06.070 --> 05:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
elementary schools instead of teaching
 
05:28:08.510 --> 05:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
kids multiplication tables and then they
 
05:28:10.708 --> 05:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
wonder when they have to do factoring
 
05:28:19.750 --> 05:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:24.548 --> 05:28:24.558 align:start position:0%
fail there are a host of issues I'm not
 
05:28:26.430 --> 05:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
going to take that time I'm just going
 
05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
to say let's pay for what we want let's
 
05:28:35.788 --> 05:28:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:43.350 --> 05:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr
 
05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker as the majority report States
 
05:28:49.270 --> 05:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
this is a well-intentioned bill but it
 
05:28:52.350 --> 05:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
misses the mark the sponsor wants to
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
link funding to proficiency scores in
 
05:28:58.868 --> 05:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
hopes of providing a financial incentive
 
05:29:02.030 --> 05:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
to increase proficiency level
 
05:29:04.190 --> 05:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
beginning in the school year
 
05:29:08.110 --> 05:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
2026 districts would get 100% of their
 
05:29:11.868 --> 05:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
Pew per pupil amount for the prior year
 
05:29:13.590 --> 05:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
but only
 
05:29:18.430 --> 05:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
75% of funding for each student below
 
05:29:21.788 --> 05:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
proficiency so for example if half the
 
05:29:26.110 --> 05:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
students in one or all of subject areas
 
05:29:28.750 --> 05:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
are not proficient then half the
 
05:29:31.868 --> 05:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
students would be funded at at just 75%
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the normal amount or in effect a 25%
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
Aid that percentage would continue to
 
05:29:45.110 --> 05:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
decrease over the next two years 75%
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
dropping to
 
05:29:51.470 --> 05:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
25% so in that third year for a student
 
05:29:53.670 --> 05:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
not proficient the district will only
 
05:29:53.680 --> 05:29:54.430 align:start position:0%
not proficient the district will only
get

05:29:54.430 --> 05:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:29:56.708 --> 05:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
25% of their normal
 
05:29:59.470 --> 05:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
funding the net result will be
 
05:30:02.310 --> 05:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
decreasing funding for all district
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
because no district and I wish it would
 
05:30:10.750 --> 05:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
be um the opposite but no district will
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
be at 100%
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
proficiency and who will get hurt by
 
05:30:19.230 --> 05:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
this the students we are trying to help
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the past we have tried a different
 
05:30:24.708 --> 05:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
approach we tried incentive
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
grants uh something in our the opinion
 
05:30:30.590 --> 05:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
of many of us on the committee something
 
05:30:32.830 --> 05:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
that we should explore further and there
 
05:30:34.750 --> 05:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
are states that are actually building
 
05:30:37.948 --> 05:30:37.958 align:start position:0%
incentive grants into their adequacy for
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
formula for schools and students that
 
05:30:44.670 --> 05:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
are showing growth show showing academic
 
05:30:46.548 --> 05:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
increases I think that's the way we
 
05:30:49.230 --> 05:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
should go rather than penalizing
 
05:30:51.590 --> 05:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
districts I want to thank the sponsor
 
05:30:54.190 --> 05:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
for at least bringing attention to our
 
05:30:56.590 --> 05:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates and the need for
 
05:30:59.270 --> 05:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
improvement but we need to find a
 
05:31:01.548 --> 05:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
different path than provided in this
 
05:31:04.830 --> 05:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
you motion before
 
05:31:09.868 --> 05:31:09.878 align:start position:0%
is majority committee report of
 
05:31:12.830 --> 05:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislated on House Bill
 
05:31:16.390 --> 05:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
1675 are you ready for the question all

amended on House Bill
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
1577 representative Lanes recognized
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:17.270 --> 05:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
motion I think I'm speaking for motion
 
05:44:20.830 --> 05:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
pass oh no sorry wrong Bill okay that
 
05:44:27.270 --> 05:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
was the LA that was the last bill okay
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
I think everybody over here kind of went
 
05:44:34.510 --> 05:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
oh my God all
 
05:44:37.390 --> 05:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
right so this bill would allow an
 
05:44:40.030 --> 05:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
unlimited number of citizens to inspect
 
05:44:42.270 --> 05:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
ballots for a period of four months
 
05:44:45.030 --> 05:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
after an election under the supervision
 
05:44:47.670 --> 05:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State it allows
 
05:44:50.270 --> 05:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
independent groups to carry out their
 
05:44:52.910 --> 05:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
unofficial I'm sorry their unofficial
 
05:44:55.830 --> 05:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
recounts and tests of voting machines
 
05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
and will allow access to digital copies
 
05:45:02.430 --> 05:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
of the ballots because such independent
 
05:45:05.390 --> 05:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
audit will not follow any regular
 
05:45:08.670 --> 05:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
procedure their erent and in unreliable
 
05:45:11.350 --> 05:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
results will erode confidence in
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
elections not increase it passing this
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill gives Credence to the view that our
 
05:45:20.830 --> 05:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
elections are rigged and fraudulent it
 
05:45:23.468 --> 05:45:23.478 align:start position:0%
perpetuates the myth that the 20120 New
 
05:45:25.390 --> 05:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections were
 
05:45:28.510 --> 05:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
unreliable our governor our secretary of
 
05:45:30.910 --> 05:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
state and the special committee on voter
 
05:45:34.350 --> 05:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
confidence have all recently expressed
 
05:45:37.310 --> 05:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
confidence in the security and lack of
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
widespread Fred fraud sorry in New
 
05:45:43.868 --> 05:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections the committee found
 
05:45:46.948 --> 05:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
that voters most voters have confidence
 
05:45:50.430 --> 05:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
in our elections New Hampshire elections
 
05:45:54.468 --> 05:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
are accurate and ballot counting devices
 
05:45:54.478 --> 05:45:55.310 align:start position:0%
are accurate and ballot counting devices
are

05:45:55.310 --> 05:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:45:59.150 --> 05:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
reliable in short this bill is not NE
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
necessary and let me remind you that
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
virtually all errors that are found in
 
05:46:08.830 --> 05:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
recounts are due to human errors and not
 
05:46:08.840 --> 05:46:10.468 align:start position:0%
recounts are due to human errors and not
machine

05:46:10.468 --> 05:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
machine
 
05:46:13.750 --> 05:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
errors there are plenty of me measures
 
05:46:17.270 --> 05:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
already in place in our law to safeguard
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
against errors in our voting vote
 
05:46:22.868 --> 05:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
counting machines each vote voting
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%

05:46:30.830 --> 05:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
each moderator must reconcile the votes
 
05:46:33.350 --> 05:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
before leaving the polling
 
05:46:36.190 --> 05:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
location we have multiple
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
recounts of State Rep and state senate
 
05:46:43.990 --> 05:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
races each election cycle that will
 
05:46:47.430 --> 05:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
uncover any issues widespread issues
 
05:46:50.590 --> 05:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
with the machines in multiple
 
05:46:54.590 --> 05:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
districts we enacted a new law in
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
2022 that adopted even more protective
 
05:47:00.590 --> 05:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
measures for general election recounts
 
05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
of State Rep races the secretary of
 
05:47:06.750 --> 05:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
state must also conduct an audit of the
 
05:47:09.390 --> 05:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
votes cast on those ballots for
 
05:47:12.948 --> 05:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
president US state senate United States
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives or governor and
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State picks those at
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
random the SOS must conduct such audit
 
05:47:25.030 --> 05:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
using the ballots for 10 of the state
 
05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative races to be recounted
 
05:47:31.230 --> 05:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
these recounts are open to public
 
05:47:33.830 --> 05:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
viewing I went up and watched some and I
 
05:47:36.310 --> 05:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
think I was one of maybe 10 people that
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
went up there to look they're open
 
05:47:40.270 --> 05:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're in addition to the
 
05:47:42.750 --> 05:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
recounts so there's another way to
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
verify the secretary of state must
 
05:47:49.150 --> 05:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
conduct a full recount of any race where
 
05:47:52.150 --> 05:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
there is a discrepancy of greater than
 
05:47:55.350 --> 05:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
1% from the election results reported to
 
05:47:58.670 --> 05:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State also the ballot
 
05:48:01.868 --> 05:48:01.878 align:start position:0%
accounting devices are con not connected
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
to the internet so they can't be
 
05:48:08.270 --> 05:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
hacked this bill will Rec will also
 
05:48:11.390 --> 05:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
create an enormous administrative burden
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
on the Secretary of State resulting in
 
05:48:17.070 --> 05:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
significant new costs that the bill does
 
05:48:21.110 --> 05:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
not fund for all these reasons I ask
 
05:48:24.350 --> 05:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
that we vote again against otpa so that
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
a different motion can be brought and I
 
05:48:31.230 --> 05:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.670 --> 05:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative Barry's recognized to
 
05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the motion uh thank
 
05:48:37.990 --> 05:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker uh so earlier today we
 
05:48:41.830 --> 05:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
adopted measures um that would allow for
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
the introduction of the new voting
 
05:48:46.390 --> 05:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
machines and I'm not here to rehash that
 
05:48:48.590 --> 05:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that is cool about
 
05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
the new voting machines is they use
 
05:48:53.548 --> 05:48:53.558 align:start position:0%
Digital Imaging versus OCR technology so
 
05:48:56.468 --> 05:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
in the future we will be able to store
 
05:48:58.350 --> 05:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
digital images of the ballot and after
 
05:49:00.750 --> 05:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
the election is certified done and
 
05:49:03.270 --> 05:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
settled we will have the ability to
 
05:49:05.788 --> 05:49:05.798 align:start position:0%
upload those and people can go and do
 
05:49:07.948 --> 05:49:07.958 align:start position:0%
their own citizen audits they can do
 
05:49:09.948 --> 05:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
their own recounts and the technology
 
05:49:11.670 --> 05:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
will exist that you will actually be
 
05:49:14.030 --> 05:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
able to see how the machine counted the
 
05:49:15.910 --> 05:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
ballot there's further things that are
 
05:49:17.230 --> 05:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
not in this bill that we could do that
 
05:49:18.910 --> 05:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
are actually really cool in the future
 
05:49:20.548 --> 05:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
you might be able to look at your ballot
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
and no one would know it's your ballot
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
no one would know only you would know
 
05:49:25.628 --> 05:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
but you'll be able to see how the
 
05:49:29.110 --> 05:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
machine counted your ballot
 
05:49:30.990 --> 05:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
we have to do these things we have to
 
05:49:33.190 --> 05:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
start having this conversation now I do
 
05:49:35.190 --> 05:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the ranking member from the
 
05:49:37.708 --> 05:49:37.718 align:start position:0%
other side talking about of granted
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
stators having faith in the elections
 
05:49:41.670 --> 05:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
she's right voter confidence in the
 
05:49:43.230 --> 05:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
election in a UNH survey that came out
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday was at an all-time high
 
05:49:48.190 --> 05:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's still 23 to 25% of
 
05:49:50.270 --> 05:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
the voters who have questions and we
 
05:49:52.110 --> 05:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
need to get that number as low as
 
05:49:54.030 --> 05:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
possible we the machines are not going
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere but let's make them as
 
05:49:57.628 --> 05:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible so that people
 
05:49:58.990 --> 05:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
can have confidence
 
05:50:01.270 --> 05:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that's why I urge the body to vote
 
05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%

05:52:16.548 --> 05:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
members of the house if I know that one
 
05:52:19.110 --> 05:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
aspect of voter confidence relies on the
 
05:52:21.150 --> 05:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
ability of the voters to verify an
 
05:52:23.708 --> 05:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
election machines accuracy and
 
05:52:26.070 --> 05:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
reliability if I know that this bill
 
05:52:28.468 --> 05:52:28.478 align:start position:0%
allows a voter to verify that the
 
05:52:30.510 --> 05:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
submitted ballot has been interpreted
 
05:52:32.708 --> 05:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
accurately and correctly and if I know
 
05:52:34.948 --> 05:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
that the verification process would be
 
05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
done with transparency under the
 
05:52:38.990 --> 05:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
supervision of the Secretary of State's
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
office and finally if I know that the
 
05:52:43.628 --> 05:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill would protect
 
05:52:45.750 --> 05:52:45.760 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Mr Speaker and honorable
 
05:54:37.990 --> 05:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues the New Hampshire Organic
 
05:54:40.510 --> 05:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
certification program has been in effect
 
05:54:42.030 --> 05:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
for over 30
 
05:54:47.070 --> 05:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
years we are only one of only 12 states
 
05:54:48.948 --> 05:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
that have this type of
 
05:54:53.350 --> 05:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
program unfortunately it is not
 
05:54:55.948 --> 05:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
sustainable the cost of this program is
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
close to14 million
 
05:54:58.558 --> 05:55:00.070 align:start position:0%
close to14 million
per

05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
per
 
05:55:04.230 --> 05:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
year we have over 4,000 farms in the
 
05:55:05.948 --> 05:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
05:55:08.788 --> 05:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of those
 
05:55:11.788 --> 05:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
110 are organically
 
05:55:14.628 --> 05:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
certified and of
 
05:55:20.788 --> 05:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
those only 58 are certified through this
 
05:55:23.230 --> 05:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
program the
 
05:55:25.548 --> 05:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
program is funded through the end of

program is funded through the end of
this

05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:55:27.000 --> 05:55:28.510 align:start position:0%
this
year

05:55:28.510 --> 05:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:55:31.310 --> 05:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
it's not going to harm them for this
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
growing season but we also know that
 
05:55:37.110 --> 05:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
there are several options available to
 
05:55:41.110 --> 05:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
these farms in fact there are over seven
 
05:55:44.070 --> 05:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
companies currently certifying the other
 
05:55:47.390 --> 05:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
52 organic crop farms in New
 
05:55:50.270 --> 05:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is there an increased
 
05:55:50.280 --> 05:55:51.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is there an increased
cost

05:55:51.910 --> 05:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:55:54.468 --> 05:55:54.478 align:start position:0%
yes but the costs will increase under
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture next year
 
05:55:58.910 --> 05:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
too because through the Department of
 
05:56:00.230 --> 05:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
Agriculture there has not been an
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
increase in over 30 years since the
 
05:56:02.320 --> 05:56:03.910 align:start position:0%
increase in over 30 years since the
program

05:56:03.910 --> 05:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:56:07.750 --> 05:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
began these Farms have the ability to
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
have the fees offset through USDA
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
programs and get reimbursed up to 75% of
 
05:56:17.788 --> 05:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
the cost of an Organic certification up
 
05:56:22.030 --> 05:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:26.150 --> 05:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
$750 I understand that change is
 
05:56:28.750 --> 05:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
difficult but the agricult cultural
 
05:56:31.868 --> 05:56:31.878 align:start position:0%
Community is constantly changing no
 
05:56:35.310 --> 05:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
matter what type of farm you have we in
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
agriculture are in a constant flux
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
whether we want to be or
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
not agriculture is part of New
 
05:56:45.948 --> 05:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's roots and I value those
 
05:56:49.708 --> 05:56:49.718 align:start position:0%
routs immensely it is not easy to end a
 
05:56:52.270 --> 05:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
program but knowing there are several
 
05:56:55.590 --> 05:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
other options available that those costs
 
05:56:58.030 --> 05:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
can be offset again through the USD
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
certification program with grants of up
 
05:57:01.040 --> 05:57:02.150 align:start position:0%
certification program with grants of up
to

05:57:02.150 --> 05:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
75% is the good
 
05:57:08.708 --> 05:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
news extending this program for two or
 
05:57:11.868 --> 05:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
three years will not change the outcome
 
05:57:13.510 --> 05:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the cost of these Farms through the
 
05:57:16.548 --> 05:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
new Hamp certification program could be
 
05:57:16.558 --> 05:57:17.510 align:start position:0%
new Hamp certification program could be
over

05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:57:20.948 --> 05:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
$3500 per year which is not
 
05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable it is almost triple what
 
05:57:26.670 --> 05:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
they would pay through a private program
 
05:57:28.510 --> 05:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
and that is before re re
 
05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
imbursement and Mr Speaker I would ask
 
05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
the body to vote r on the otpa mo OTP
 
05:57:37.230 --> 05:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
motion and I would ask for a division
 
05:57:37.240 --> 05:57:39.430 align:start position:0%
motion and I would ask for a division
vote

05:57:39.430 --> 05:57:39.440 align:start position:0%

damp the idea of organic agriculture
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
goes back to the first half of the 20th
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
century when it was developed as a way
 
05:58:07.750 --> 05:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
to build soil Health which would in turn
 
05:58:09.628 --> 05:58:09.638 align:start position:0%
provide crops the nutrients they need
 
05:58:11.830 --> 05:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
for strong growth organic agriculture
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:58:33.830 --> 05:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
Niche to being a more highly valued

programs NOA New Hampshire started such
 
05:58:54.548 --> 05:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
a program in the mid 1980s the
 
05:58:56.510 --> 05:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of damp at the at the time
 
05:58:58.788 --> 05:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
Steve Taylor recognized that the that
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
NOA needed assistance in managing the
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
program and offered to take it over in
 
05:59:07.750 --> 05:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
1987 in the 1990s the USDA developed
 
05:59:09.868 --> 05:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
uniform national standards for organic
 
05:59:11.788 --> 05:59:11.798 align:start position:0%
labeling which went into effect in the
 
05:59:11.798 --> 05:59:12.670 align:start position:0%
labeling which went into effect in the
early

05:59:12.670 --> 05:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
early
 
05:59:15.190 --> 05:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
2000s damp became an accredited
 
05:59:18.590 --> 05:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
certifying agent under the USDA National
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
organic program at that point the
 
05:59:23.590 --> 05:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
certification program was run under the
 
05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
division of regulatory services with
 
05:59:28.270 --> 05:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
costs partially offset by Fe
 
05:59:30.190 --> 05:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
for the past two decades the department
 
05:59:32.990 --> 05:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
has provided USDA organic certification
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire's organic farmers and
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
has earned their trust and their
 
05:59:39.468 --> 05:59:39.478 align:start position:0%
respect over that period of time
 
05:59:41.310 --> 05:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
requirements under the national organic
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
program have become more complicated

06:04:31.030 --> 06:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
know that the Department of Agriculture

1987 but in the last 20 years has failed
 
06:04:41.390 --> 06:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
to increase the fees and if I know that
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
large Farms are under Decline and are
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
being replaced by smaller organic farms
 
06:04:50.510 --> 06:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the consumer is
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
demanding organic products that are

06:05:05.150 --> 06:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
to approve future funding so that our
 
06:05:08.070 --> 06:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
organic farmers can continue to provide
 
06:05:11.390 --> 06:05:11.400 align:start position:0%

06:12:05.150 --> 06:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
considered the same and being unable to
 
06:12:07.230 --> 06:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority Report with the
 
06:12:09.270 --> 06:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill be referred
 
06:12:11.830 --> 06:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
for interim study representative Sher

Duty for the minority of the
 
06:12:16.468 --> 06:12:16.478 align:start position:0%
committee the question is on the
 
06:12:18.670 --> 06:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
majority committee report of inexpedient
 
06:12:20.750 --> 06:12:20.760 align:start position:0%

06:12:25.440 --> 06:12:28.110 align:start position:0%
against the committee
report

06:12:28.110 --> 06:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
report
 
06:12:29.830 --> 06:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker you saved me the
 
06:12:31.868 --> 06:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
work of saying that I'm up here to speak
 
06:12:35.310 --> 06:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:38.030 --> 06:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
report I can imagine that many of you
 
06:12:40.150 --> 06:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
like me spend a lot of hours looking
 
06:12:42.628 --> 06:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
through the state Solid Waste Management
 
06:12:44.830 --> 06:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
report and savoring all of the
 
06:12:47.830 --> 06:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
details uh when you do that you wouldn't
 
06:12:51.390 --> 06:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
fail to see a triangle in the first few
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
pages of that text that shows our Solid
 
06:12:56.670 --> 06:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
Waste Management plan and what our
 
06:12:59.030 --> 06:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
strategy is supposed to be at the very
 
06:13:00.788 --> 06:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
top of that triangle what we're supposed
 
06:13:04.030 --> 06:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
to be doing first and foremost is
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of waste that we're
 
06:13:08.628 --> 06:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
producing in the state at the bottom of
 
06:13:10.910 --> 06:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
that is landfilling landfilling should
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
be the last thing that we're doing with
 
06:13:16.708 --> 06:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
the natural resources of our state and
 
06:13:19.430 --> 06:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
yet if you take a look at that report
 
06:13:21.788 --> 06:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
you'll see that that triangle is upside
 
06:13:24.868 --> 06:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
down the fact of the matter is we use
 
06:13:27.910 --> 06:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
landfill first first and foremost and
 
06:13:29.628 --> 06:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
more often than we're using the other
 
06:13:31.190 --> 06:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
vital elements of our Solid Waste
 
06:13:31.200 --> 06:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
vital elements of our Solid Waste
reduction

06:13:32.310 --> 06:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
06:13:34.990 --> 06:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
strategy our efforts at reductions so
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
far have proven unfortunately to be
 
06:13:40.110 --> 06:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
inadequate to say the
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
least our goal as stated in the 1990
 
06:13:46.590 --> 06:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste reduction plan was to reduce
 
06:13:48.150 --> 06:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
our waste by
 
06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
45% by the year
 
06:13:54.708 --> 06:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
2050 current projections have us missing
 
06:13:57.150 --> 06:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
that Mark by more than
 
06:14:00.750 --> 06:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
50% by the middle of this
 
06:14:03.708 --> 06:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
Century onethird of the waste that we
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
continue to put into our landfills comes
 
06:14:06.958 --> 06:14:08.230 align:start position:0%
continue to put into our landfills comes
from

06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
packaging this bill would establish an
 
06:14:13.590 --> 06:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
06:14:16.510 --> 06:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
Responsibility program the bill is
 
06:14:18.948 --> 06:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
definitely complicated because the
 
06:14:22.350 --> 06:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
problem is complicated it's
 
06:14:26.548 --> 06:14:26.558 align:start position:0%
multifaceted the subject needs more more
 
06:14:30.270 --> 06:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
study and so what I am here to do today
 
06:14:33.750 --> 06:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker is to ask my colleagues to
 
06:14:35.868 --> 06:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl motion so that we
 
06:14:37.830 --> 06:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
can send this to an interim study
 
06:14:40.230 --> 06:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
committee where we can start to look at
 
06:14:44.230 --> 06:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
specific pieces of eppr taken as a whole
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
it is enormous it is complicated is it
 
06:14:49.150 --> 06:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
is difficult but we can start to make
 
06:14:51.670 --> 06:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
progress in the direction of our stated
 
06:14:54.590 --> 06:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management goals if we start
 
06:14:57.150 --> 06:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
to take it apart one piece at a time and
 
06:14:59.390 --> 06:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
an interim study would allow us to take
 
06:15:03.230 --> 06:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
a more concentrated approach to the
 
06:15:06.030 --> 06:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
problem the key word I think in this
 
06:15:08.350 --> 06:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
phrase extended producer
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility is
 
06:15:12.590 --> 06:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility each and every one of us
 
06:15:15.788 --> 06:15:15.798 align:start position:0%
as individuals has responsibility the
 
06:15:17.628 --> 06:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
kind of unspoken very top of that
 
06:15:19.948 --> 06:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
triangle that I referred to earlier is
 
06:15:23.548 --> 06:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
actually refuse that is that each of us
 
06:15:25.868 --> 06:15:25.878 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility I would argue to
 
06:15:28.670 --> 06:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
ref refuse to contribute to the waste
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
production to find ways not to consume
 
06:15:33.750 --> 06:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
things that are going to have to end up
 
06:15:35.468 --> 06:15:35.478 align:start position:0%
in our waste management system that's
 
06:15:37.590 --> 06:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
the very first thing that we can do and
 
06:15:39.670 --> 06:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
each of us has a responsibility to do
 
06:15:43.468 --> 06:15:43.478 align:start position:0%
that this legislative body which
 
06:15:46.190 --> 06:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
approves which uh looks at studies and
 
06:15:47.868 --> 06:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
approves the goals set in that Solid
 
06:15:50.070 --> 06:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
Waste Management plan we have a
 
06:15:52.230 --> 06:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the constituents who
 
06:15:55.468 --> 06:15:55.478 align:start position:0%
sent us here to get at least a lot
 
06:15:57.468 --> 06:15:57.478 align:start position:0%
closer to the the Target that we
 
06:16:00.708 --> 06:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
promised them that we would hit in 1990
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
and we are more than 50% off from
 
06:16:05.628 --> 06:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
hitting by the year
 
06:16:09.708 --> 06:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
2050 but producers also have a
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility there is at this point in
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
time some effort on the part of some
 
06:16:19.110 --> 06:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
producers to reduce the packaging but
 
06:16:21.270 --> 06:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are still looking at a
 
06:16:23.670 --> 06:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
third of what's going into our landfill
 
06:16:25.350 --> 06:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
coming from packaging and we all know it
 
06:16:28.948 --> 06:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
we all see it whenever you order from a
 
06:16:31.868 --> 06:16:31.878 align:start position:0%
company and you get the packaging you
 
06:16:35.468 --> 06:16:35.478 align:start position:0%
can see how much wastefulness there is
 
06:16:37.390 --> 06:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
and you can project that across the
 
06:16:39.350 --> 06:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
citizens of the Granite State and get
 
06:16:40.910 --> 06:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
some idea of what it is that we're
 
06:16:42.070 --> 06:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
putting in our
 
06:16:44.910 --> 06:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
landfills we have to acknowledge our
 
06:16:46.948 --> 06:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility but we also have to
 
06:16:50.468 --> 06:16:50.478 align:start position:0%
expect the producers to live up to their
 
06:16:53.110 --> 06:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility and so Mr Speaker I ask
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
my colleagues in the house please vote
 
06:16:58.270 --> 06:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion so that we can
 
06:17:00.670 --> 06:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
move ahead with an interim study which
 
06:17:02.830 --> 06:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
will allow us to take a big problem a
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
complicated problem and to look at it in
 
06:17:08.190 --> 06:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
more discret parts so that we can take a
 
06:17:09.670 --> 06:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
step in the direction of living up to
 
06:17:12.708 --> 06:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
our responsibility of a legislative body
 
06:17:14.430 --> 06:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
to serve the interests of the people who
 
06:17:17.670 --> 06:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
sent us here thank you Mr Speaker I ask
 
06:17:19.788 --> 06:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
for a division
 
06:17:22.390 --> 06:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
vote representative aens recognized to
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the committee
 
06:17:25.000 --> 06:17:29.070 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the committee
report

06:17:29.070 --> 06:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:31.670 --> 06:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:17:34.230 --> 06:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker dear friends and
 
06:17:36.390 --> 06:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues HB
 
06:17:39.390 --> 06:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
1630 would establish an extended
 
06:17:42.750 --> 06:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
producer Responsibility program in New
 
06:17:45.910 --> 06:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while we all recognize that
 
06:17:49.468 --> 06:17:49.478 align:start position:0%
improved recycling is important as is
 
06:17:52.430 --> 06:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
keeping toxic substances out of our
 
06:17:56.548 --> 06:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
landfills the truth is this bill is too
 
06:18:00.628 --> 06:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
broad and that epr legislation should be
 
06:18:06.548 --> 06:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
enacted carefully and in a more targeted
 
06:18:08.510 --> 06:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
peace this
 
06:18:10.628 --> 06:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm sorry this
 
06:18:12.708 --> 06:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
legislature is already working on
 
06:18:15.150 --> 06:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
diverting food waste and hazardous
 
06:18:17.910 --> 06:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
materials from our landfills we've had
 
06:18:21.390 --> 06:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
17 landfill bills in my committee and
 
06:18:23.430 --> 06:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
we're studying ways to accomplish our
 
06:18:24.910 --> 06:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
waste reduction
 
06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
goals this Bill had many con concerning
 
06:18:31.830 --> 06:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
provisions and it would also cost our
 
06:18:35.948 --> 06:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayers between a milon
 
06:18:39.670 --> 06:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
$1,624 th000 a year to
 
06:18:42.390 --> 06:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
administer this bill sets up a huge
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
state bureaucracy with great Reliance on
 
06:18:48.110 --> 06:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
06:18:48.120 --> 06:18:48.910 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
for

06:18:48.910 --> 06:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:18:51.948 --> 06:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
administration as well as establishing a
 
06:18:55.070 --> 06:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
packaging reduction organization there's
 
06:18:57.750 --> 06:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely no guarantee that the
 
06:19:00.270 --> 06:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
proposals in this bill will accomplish
 
06:19:03.030 --> 06:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
the goals it sets forth and it also
 
06:19:06.310 --> 06:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
establishes unattainable standards it
 
06:19:08.670 --> 06:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
will also have significant impact to
 
06:19:11.468 --> 06:19:11.478 align:start position:0%
consumers in our state by Banning
 
06:19:13.390 --> 06:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
specific critical products from being
 
06:19:16.310 --> 06:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
used or sold in New Hampshire other
 
06:19:19.468 --> 06:19:19.478 align:start position:0%
states like Maine have embarked on this
 
06:19:22.830 --> 06:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
type of extensive epr program and they
 
06:19:25.230 --> 06:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
have encountered many problems in its
 
06:19:25.240 --> 06:19:26.670 align:start position:0%

implementation
 
06:19:29.468 --> 06:19:29.478 align:start position:0%
which after a lot of time and taxpayer
 
06:19:32.990 --> 06:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
money invested is still not
 
06:19:35.948 --> 06:19:35.958 align:start position:0%
functional in New Hampshire we are
 
06:19:38.270 --> 06:19:38.280 align:start position:0%

Solid Waste going into our landfills and

through other pieces of legislation
 
06:19:46.708 --> 06:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
additionally our legislator's Solid

Waste working group is seeking ways to
 
06:19:51.510 --> 06:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish waste reduction through
 
06:19:54.750 --> 06:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
suggested legislation as it works with
 
06:19:58.070 --> 06:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
legislators stakeholders waste haulers

Regulators so please join me in pressing
 
06:20:06.110 --> 06:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
the green button to itl this costly and

06:20:13.590 --> 06:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
you the questions on the majority
 
06:20:16.270 --> 06:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexpedient to
 
06:20:19.868 --> 06:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 1630
 
06:20:23.990 --> 06:20:24.000 align:start position:0%

06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh thank you uh
 
06:20:32.788 --> 06:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:20:36.030 --> 06:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
given that the vast majority of consumer
 
06:20:38.910 --> 06:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
products consumed in New Hampshire are
 
06:20:42.390 --> 06:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
in fact produced out of state and
 
06:20:45.590 --> 06:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
produced on a national scale for all 50
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
states would it be appropriate to say
 
06:20:52.910 --> 06:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
that an Erp program really is a state
 
06:20:56.390 --> 06:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
tax on packaging that gets applied to
 
06:21:00.070 --> 06:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
the business that produces the goods but
 
06:21:03.270 --> 06:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
yet gets downshifted onto consumer goods
 
06:21:08.910 --> 06:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:11.350 --> 06:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
consumer yes you consider you can
 
06:21:13.230 --> 06:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
consider it that
 
06:21:13.240 --> 06:21:15.788 align:start position:0%
consider it that
way

06:21:15.788 --> 06:21:15.798 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:21:19.430 --> 06:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
follow does the member yield for another
 
06:21:22.030 --> 06:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
06:21:24.990 --> 06:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh for taking my my question given that
 
06:21:27.230 --> 06:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of consumer products
 
06:21:29.670 --> 06:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
are made on a national scale wouldn't an
 
06:21:33.628 --> 06:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
Erp program be epr program be more
 
06:21:35.788 --> 06:21:35.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate at the federal level
 
06:21:38.270 --> 06:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be a federal responsibility
 
06:21:40.270 --> 06:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
instead of each state setting up their
 
06:21:42.990 --> 06:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
own uh fifs that that then companies
 
06:21:48.670 --> 06:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:51.468 --> 06:21:51.478 align:start position:0%
rules well with regard to packaging and
 
06:21:53.948 --> 06:21:53.958 align:start position:0%
labeling and that kind of thing it seems
 
06:21:56.030 --> 06:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
to make sense that some of that would
 
06:21:58.868 --> 06:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
have to be accomplished through Federal
 
06:22:02.150 --> 06:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
legislation um and yeah you there's a
 
06:22:05.110 --> 06:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh 50 different states
 
06:22:07.150 --> 06:22:07.160 align:start position:0%
coming up with 50 different kinds of
 
06:22:10.830 --> 06:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
plans could complicate a lot of things
 
06:22:10.840 --> 06:22:13.910 align:start position:0%
plans could complicate a lot of things
thank

06:22:13.910 --> 06:22:13.920 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:24:21.110 --> 06:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
if I know that the minority of the

committee is in support of an interim
 
06:24:24.750 --> 06:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
interim study of this issue not the
 
06:24:27.270 --> 06:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
under L epr Bill and its related
 
06:24:29.708 --> 06:24:29.718 align:start position:0%
expenses and I also know that extended
 
06:24:31.590 --> 06:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility is an important
 
06:24:33.190 --> 06:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
means of reducing our dependency on
 
06:24:35.310 --> 06:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
landfills reducing the toxins in our
 
06:24:37.030 --> 06:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
waist stream and decreasing the

06:25:00.670 --> 06:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill though well-
 
06:25:03.070 --> 06:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
intended would cost the state between a
 
06:25:06.830 --> 06:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
million to approximately a milon 600,000
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
annually to
 
06:25:12.868 --> 06:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
administer and Mr Speaker if I know this
 
06:25:15.628 --> 06:25:15.638 align:start position:0%
there is no guarantee that the proposals
 
06:25:17.590 --> 06:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill will accomplish the goals
 
06:25:20.750 --> 06:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
set forth and that it sets up
 
06:25:24.190 --> 06:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
unattainable standards and Mr Speaker
 
06:25:26.708 --> 06:25:26.718 align:start position:0%

06:25:32.990 --> 06:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
extensive epr programs like this one and
 
06:25:36.150 --> 06:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
have encountered many problems in its
 
06:25:38.230 --> 06:25:38.240 align:start position:0%

if I believe that
 
06:29:22.350 --> 06:29:22.360 align:start position:0%

06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know the focus
 
06:30:04.468 --> 06:30:04.478 align:start position:0%
of legislation should not be attacking
 
06:30:06.270 --> 06:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
or Banning pet retail stores in New
 
06:30:08.670 --> 06:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but rather regulating the
 
06:30:11.830 --> 06:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
sourcing of these animals for resale and
 
06:30:14.510 --> 06:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
if I know the biggest concerns we heard
 
06:30:16.270 --> 06:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
from the public were a potential
 
06:30:16.280 --> 06:30:17.510 align:start position:0%
from the public were a potential
sourcing

06:30:17.510 --> 06:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
sourcing
 
06:30:20.670 --> 06:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
problem puppy mills not a pet store
 
06:30:22.990 --> 06:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
problem and if I know that this bill
 
06:30:25.750 --> 06:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
punishes all versus gets to the heart of
 
06:30:29.030 --> 06:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
the issue people were most upset with
 
06:30:31.590 --> 06:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that passing this
 
06:30:34.190 --> 06:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
bill would eliminate future private
 
06:30:37.190 --> 06:30:37.200 align:start position:0%

motion thank you Mr Speaker you may all
 
06:34:25.110 --> 06:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
remember this from last year year or the
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
year before possibly five years ago
 
06:34:29.070 --> 06:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard it
 
06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
before and what was notable about the
 
06:34:35.510 --> 06:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and the discussion this year
 
06:34:39.070 --> 06:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
is that the music therapists did not say
 
06:34:41.948 --> 06:34:41.958 align:start position:0%
we need to have a license so that we can
 
06:34:44.468 --> 06:34:44.478 align:start position:0%
keep we can set minimum standards and
 
06:34:46.910 --> 06:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
keep unqualified people from practicing
 
06:34:48.590 --> 06:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:34:52.150 --> 06:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
state they also did not say we need to
 
06:34:55.670 --> 06:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
have a license so we will have a way to
 
06:34:59.388 --> 06:34:59.398 align:start position:0%
discipline misbehaving or
 
06:35:02.750 --> 06:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
incompetent practitioners it's a protect
 
06:35:05.628 --> 06:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
Public Safety no they didn't mention
 
06:35:08.310 --> 06:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
that the reason they want a license is
 
06:35:10.948 --> 06:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
that their customers don't want to pay
 
06:35:15.910 --> 06:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
full price or for their services so that
 
06:35:18.230 --> 06:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
they want to have a license so they can
 
06:35:21.868 --> 06:35:21.878 align:start position:0%
build Medicaid they can build Medicare
 
06:35:24.150 --> 06:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
they can build the V build the VA and
 
06:35:26.110 --> 06:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
they can can build private insurers for
 
06:35:28.628 --> 06:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
their services that's the only reason
 
06:35:30.948 --> 06:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
they brought forward this
 
06:35:34.190 --> 06:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and I don't think it's an
 
06:35:37.150 --> 06:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate use of State Authority and
 
06:35:39.750 --> 06:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
Licensing which is intended to protect
 
06:35:43.110 --> 06:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
the public safety to bring it in so that
 
06:35:45.670 --> 06:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
the practitioners have a more convenient
 
06:35:46.750 --> 06:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
way to get
 
06:35:50.150 --> 06:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursed um please vote against ought
 
06:35:50.160 --> 06:35:51.868 align:start position:0%
reimbursed um please vote against ought
to

06:35:51.868 --> 06:35:51.878 align:start position:0%

06:36:00.230 --> 06:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr
 
06:36:03.030 --> 06:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill establishes The Lure
 
06:36:05.070 --> 06:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
and regulation of Music therapists under
 
06:36:07.708 --> 06:36:07.718 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
06:36:09.788 --> 06:36:09.798 align:start position:0%
certification the committee heard a lot
 
06:36:11.910 --> 06:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
of testimony about the value the service
 
06:36:14.590 --> 06:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
offers residents most notably our
 
06:36:17.868 --> 06:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
veterans we heard a lot of detail about
 
06:36:21.708 --> 06:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is a science and that
 
06:36:23.910 --> 06:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
when applied inappropriately by people
 
06:36:26.468 --> 06:36:26.478 align:start position:0%
who have not been trained properly in it
 
06:36:29.190 --> 06:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
in fact is harmful it's not just
 
06:36:31.628 --> 06:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
enjoying music
 
06:36:36.070 --> 06:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
lightly so lure is an important part of
 
06:36:39.190 --> 06:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
it without licensing clients cannot use
 
06:36:41.548 --> 06:36:41.558 align:start position:0%
their insurance to pay for a service
 
06:36:44.510 --> 06:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
that notably improves their well-being
 
06:36:46.310 --> 06:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
and it's especially important to our
 
06:36:48.750 --> 06:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
veterans a similar bill passed this
 
06:36:50.868 --> 06:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
house last year some changes found
 
06:36:53.110 --> 06:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
enough support to clear on the other
 
06:36:55.030 --> 06:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
side of the wall too
 
06:36:56.910 --> 06:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
it's stalled in Committee of conference
 
06:36:59.110 --> 06:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
we believe this amended bill will make
 
06:37:01.150 --> 06:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
it through the general court into law

proposed a bill this type of legislation
 
06:48:17.628 --> 06:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
has been front of been in front of us at
 
06:48:22.190 --> 06:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
least six or seven times in the last 10

years
 
06:48:27.628 --> 06:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
I've tried to work with my fellow labor
 
06:48:30.868 --> 06:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
committee members and we're close to
 
06:48:33.948 --> 06:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
having an agreement but we're not quite
 
06:48:36.430 --> 06:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
there yet one of the problems with this
 
06:48:39.788 --> 06:48:39.798 align:start position:0%
amendment if you want to look um the one
 
06:48:46.270 --> 06:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:49.150 --> 06:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
5A I was okay with the the sentence
 
06:48:51.830 --> 06:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
about uh providing these benefits for
 
06:48:54.708 --> 06:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
employees or employee business closes or
 
06:48:56.270 --> 06:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
a changes
 
06:48:58.310 --> 06:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
ownership but the next sentence is
 
06:49:00.150 --> 06:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
something I just can't live
 
06:49:03.590 --> 06:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
with with no reasonable
 
06:49:05.948 --> 06:49:05.958 align:start position:0%
assurances you're you're you're um
 
06:49:07.430 --> 06:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
unemployed for no reasonable assurances
 
06:49:09.548 --> 06:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
of employee being you being return to
 
06:49:12.430 --> 06:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
work when we make these laws these are
 
06:49:14.430 --> 06:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
laws that need to be interpreted by the
 
06:49:16.990 --> 06:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and then hearings
 
06:49:20.230 --> 06:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
officers reasonable insurance is is like
 
06:49:21.708 --> 06:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
you know it's not something we should be
 
06:49:23.350 --> 06:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
doing in the legislature something
 
06:49:26.590 --> 06:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:26.600 --> 06:49:27.890 align:start position:0%
 
vague

06:49:27.890 --> 06:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
vague
 
06:49:27.900 --> 06:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
vague

[Music]
 
06:49:32.990 --> 06:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
the thing about New Hampshire is it and
 
06:49:36.788 --> 06:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
and like most States no business is the
 
06:49:39.070 --> 06:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
same and we're trying to put everything
 
06:49:42.110 --> 06:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
into one simple package here when every
 
06:49:45.708 --> 06:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
business is not one simple package CPAs
 
06:49:47.910 --> 06:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
for instance they tell their employees
 
06:49:49.750 --> 06:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
you can't take any time off between
 
06:49:52.670 --> 06:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
January and April 15th a lot of people
 
06:49:54.670 --> 06:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
in the hospitality industry the same
 
06:49:56.590 --> 06:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
thing around the Thanksgiving to the
 
06:49:59.430 --> 06:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
Christmas holiday there's one company in
 
06:50:01.670 --> 06:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester that makes uh chocolates I'm
 
06:50:03.590 --> 06:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
sure you all know them they close down
 
06:50:07.110 --> 06:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
the entire month of June to retool their
 
06:50:09.110 --> 06:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
Factory what if
 
06:50:12.350 --> 06:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
you're uh lay asphalt for a living well
 
06:50:14.708 --> 06:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
you know basically from December till
 
06:50:18.110 --> 06:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
March you're not going to have any
 
06:50:20.590 --> 06:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
work so we're trying to put all of these
 
06:50:22.750 --> 06:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
things into one package and you just
 
06:50:22.760 --> 06:50:23.750 align:start position:0%
things into one package and you just
can't

06:50:23.750 --> 06:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
can't
 
06:50:26.270 --> 06:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
and reasonable Assurance really doesn't
 
06:50:28.590 --> 06:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
help it doesn't give the Department of
 
06:50:30.388 --> 06:50:30.398 align:start position:0%
Labor what they
 
06:50:33.830 --> 06:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
need so I would ask that you vote uh
 
06:50:35.110 --> 06:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
down this
 
06:50:38.110 --> 06:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
amendment um and I'm going to ask for a
 
06:50:43.030 --> 06:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:49.070 --> 06:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:52.230 --> 06:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
kill thank you Mr Speaker and I'd like
 
06:50:54.110 --> 06:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
to thank uh
 
06:50:56.190 --> 06:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
my good friend Mr infantine for raising
 
06:50:58.190 --> 06:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
some of the points that he did because
 
06:51:01.110 --> 06:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment is is based largely on
 
06:51:04.948 --> 06:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
this idea that there are no no one
 
06:51:07.430 --> 06:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
simple solution no blanket
 
06:51:11.708 --> 06:51:11.718 align:start position:0%
rules um in fact the the language that
 
06:51:15.628 --> 06:51:15.638 align:start position:0%
he's referenced to uh changed ownership
 
06:51:17.468 --> 06:51:17.478 align:start position:0%
or because their employment ended with
 
06:51:19.948 --> 06:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
no reasonable Assurance of the employee
 
06:51:23.070 --> 06:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
being able to return to said employer
 
06:51:24.670 --> 06:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's because of the people
 
06:51:27.388 --> 06:51:27.398 align:start position:0%
working out there Paving roads that was
 
06:51:30.150 --> 06:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention by uh a lobbyist
 
06:51:33.230 --> 06:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
who represents that that industry and
 
06:51:37.670 --> 06:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
because you can't just say um lay off
 
06:51:39.150 --> 06:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
because they intend to come back to that
 
06:51:41.350 --> 06:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
job and that's why they have a reason
 
06:51:42.510 --> 06:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
they have an assurance that they're
 
06:51:44.990 --> 06:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
coming back when the season permits it's
 
06:51:46.430 --> 06:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be a certain date because
 
06:51:48.750 --> 06:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
our weather is kind of mish AAS right
 
06:51:52.310 --> 06:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
now but uh it's that's why that phrase
 
06:51:54.788 --> 06:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
is there and got that language from the
 
06:51:56.868 --> 06:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
gentleman in OS who happens to have
 
06:52:00.548 --> 06:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
recently worked as a wage claim officer
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
so this language is subject to
 
06:52:05.708 --> 06:52:05.718 align:start position:0%
interpretation but fairly easy to
 
06:52:09.510 --> 06:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
interpret if I if my employer says uh
 
06:52:11.830 --> 06:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'll see you next see you in the spring
 
06:52:13.310 --> 06:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
that means I have a reasonable
 
06:52:14.830 --> 06:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
assumption that I'm coming back and I
 
06:52:17.750 --> 06:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
have the option of having the vacation
 
06:52:20.628 --> 06:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
stay there or be or perhaps be paid off
 
06:52:22.468 --> 06:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
if if that's what the the people want to
 
06:52:22.478 --> 06:52:23.708 align:start position:0%
if if that's what the the people want to
do

06:52:23.708 --> 06:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:52:25.830 --> 06:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
now I'm not even sure if Paving
 
06:52:28.110 --> 06:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
Contractors offer vacation because they
 
06:52:29.830 --> 06:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
want people out there Paving every day
 
06:52:32.110 --> 06:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
they can but anyway we're not just
 
06:52:33.510 --> 06:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
talking about Paving operators we're
 
06:52:35.468 --> 06:52:35.478 align:start position:0%
talking about all kinds of jobs all
 
06:52:37.868 --> 06:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
kinds of employers and there may be
 
06:52:40.708 --> 06:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
people who shut down for two weeks and
 
06:52:42.430 --> 06:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
and everybody gets the same vacation
 
06:52:44.948 --> 06:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
that's fine no problem here but perhaps
 
06:52:47.948 --> 06:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
looking back at your own work history
 
06:52:49.590 --> 06:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
maybe you've been in that situation
 
06:52:51.150 --> 06:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
where they say we're having a
 
06:52:54.868 --> 06:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
meeting and whether or not the company
 
06:52:57.270 --> 06:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
is sold you if the company was sold you
 
06:52:59.910 --> 06:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
would think you probably had the
 
06:53:02.788 --> 06:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue on with the new
 
06:53:04.548 --> 06:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
owner because you knew the job you were
 
06:53:06.948 --> 06:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
doing the job well and the new owner
 
06:53:08.868 --> 06:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep trained people you that's
 
06:53:12.150 --> 06:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
probably what happened in most cases or
 
06:53:14.670 --> 06:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
your your vacation that you had earned
 
06:53:18.468 --> 06:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
that maybe acred or given uh all all
 
06:53:21.030 --> 06:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
front loaded was paid to you it wasn't
 
06:53:23.388 --> 06:53:23.398 align:start position:0%
take it didn't disappear from that final
 
06:53:27.388 --> 06:53:27.398 align:start position:0%
paycheck so we agree uh Mr
 
06:53:28.750 --> 06:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative infantine and I the
 
06:53:30.990 --> 06:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
previous speaker agree that when you
 
06:53:33.230 --> 06:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
change when when the company closes or
 
06:53:35.708 --> 06:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
changes ownership you certainly should
 
06:53:38.990 --> 06:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
pay your help because they had you know
 
06:53:40.468 --> 06:53:40.478 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this they're not at
 
06:53:43.788 --> 06:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
fault they're not fired and and uh
 
06:53:45.150 --> 06:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
that's the right thing to do that's what
 
06:53:47.310 --> 06:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
happens often but it doesn't have to
 
06:53:49.590 --> 06:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
happen because in New Hampshire uh the
 
06:53:52.030 --> 06:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
employer can just say in their policy
 
06:53:52.040 --> 06:53:53.670 align:start position:0%
employer can just say in their policy
that

06:53:53.670 --> 06:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:53:55.628 --> 06:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't upon
 
06:53:58.510 --> 06:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
termination vacation isn't paid and it
 
06:54:00.190 --> 06:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if you the employee of
 
06:54:02.750 --> 06:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
the month through three straight months
 
06:54:04.548 --> 06:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh you worked there for six years it
 
06:54:07.110 --> 06:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter that's the policy if you
 
06:54:09.708 --> 06:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
file a wage claim you will
 
06:54:13.590 --> 06:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
lose and again the uh I have examples
 
06:54:16.910 --> 06:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:19.628 --> 06:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
before uh in my community an assisted
 
06:54:22.350 --> 06:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
living center changed hands and the
 
06:54:26.510 --> 06:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
owner had that policy so the five people
 
06:54:29.190 --> 06:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
that bothered to file wage claims that
 
06:54:30.750 --> 06:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
took it upon themselves to think well
 
06:54:34.548 --> 06:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
this can't be right this this isn't fair
 
06:54:37.270 --> 06:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
um they lost combined
 
06:54:41.150 --> 06:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
2261 and 44 cents all stayed in the
 
06:54:44.030 --> 06:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
owner's pocket nothing was no adjustment
 
06:54:45.948 --> 06:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
was made to allow them to continue they
 
06:54:47.990 --> 06:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
did continue with the new employer but
 
06:54:50.110 --> 06:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
what was missing was this
 
06:54:52.388 --> 06:54:52.398 align:start position:0%
$2,200 now ask yourself if that's what
 
06:54:55.110 --> 06:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
you would do if it was your company or
 
06:54:56.230 --> 06:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's what you would want to have
 
06:54:58.590 --> 06:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
happen if it was your
 
06:55:01.670 --> 06:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
employer uh another case uh person was
 
06:55:03.750 --> 06:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
working for a company I think seven
 
06:55:05.788 --> 06:55:05.798 align:start position:0%
years and all of a sudden there was a
 
06:55:08.430 --> 06:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
layoff and because she had several weeks
 
06:55:10.350 --> 06:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
of vacation
 
06:55:13.030 --> 06:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
accured uh but she lost like
 
06:55:16.750 --> 06:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
$2,300 because she had no notice and
 
06:55:18.628 --> 06:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
therefore was not able to request the
 
06:55:21.708 --> 06:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
vacation with two weeks advance notice
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
now that's catch
 
06:55:26.548 --> 06:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
22 uh you you you can't win you lose you
 
06:55:28.590 --> 06:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
lose because you can't do you can't do
 
06:55:30.670 --> 06:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
the other that that's required and the
 
06:55:32.750 --> 06:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
employer gave no opportunity to do that
 
06:55:35.150 --> 06:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
so you have people who are going to work
 
06:55:37.270 --> 06:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
with the idea that what they're told is
 
06:55:40.350 --> 06:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
you have this vacation whether it's uh
 
06:55:44.788 --> 06:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
ACR or front loaded uh and you have it
 
06:55:46.430 --> 06:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's yours you're earning it's it's you
 
06:55:49.190 --> 06:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
know so much so much ACR per week it's
 
06:55:51.388 --> 06:55:51.398 align:start position:0%
yours and then all of a sudden something
 
06:55:53.548 --> 06:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
happens beyond your control
 
06:55:56.990 --> 06:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh you weren't fired but now your job is
 
06:55:59.948 --> 06:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
over or it Seas or it's your or you're
 
06:56:01.670 --> 06:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
coming back that's another situation you
 
06:56:03.468 --> 06:56:03.478 align:start position:0%
can work that out with your employer but
 
06:56:06.310 --> 06:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
in this situation where uh the employer
 
06:56:07.948 --> 06:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
says I'm not paying you because I don't
 
06:56:10.430 --> 06:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
have to I don't think we want to have
 
06:56:12.868 --> 06:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire and I'd ask you to
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
approve the amendment and then approve
 
06:56:16.788 --> 06:56:16.798 align:start position:0%

06:56:18.628 --> 06:56:18.638 align:start position:0%

06:59:12.708 --> 06:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if you know as I do
 
06:59:15.270 --> 06:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
that the term reasonable assurances is
 
06:59:17.750 --> 06:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
vague and up to various
 
06:59:19.910 --> 06:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
interpretations if you know that this
 
06:59:22.788 --> 06:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
law this amendment tries to pre
 
06:59:26.510 --> 06:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
preempt business's employee manuals
 
06:59:27.628 --> 06:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
which is not something I think our
 
06:59:30.468 --> 06:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:34.910 --> 06:59:34.920 align:start position:0%

bill and this amendment are not ready
 
06:59:38.628 --> 06:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
and I know they will have a reasonable
 
06:59:40.430 --> 06:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
assurances they probably will not pass
 
06:59:43.350 --> 06:59:43.360 align:start position:0%

07:04:08.948 --> 07:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
you know say x doll per hour so I looked
 
07:04:11.270 --> 07:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
at three kind of starting type
 
07:04:13.948 --> 07:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
jobs McDonald's
 
07:04:17.750 --> 07:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
Haniford supermarkets and uh Dunkin
 
07:04:21.230 --> 07:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
Donuts and I looked on their state of
 
07:04:22.628 --> 07:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire your web page to see
 
07:04:24.310 --> 07:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
all the jobs that are open for each one
 
07:04:26.750 --> 07:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
of these
 
07:04:29.270 --> 07:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
positions I didn't see a wage starting
 
07:04:32.868 --> 07:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
wage lower than $16 an hour at
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
McDonald's Hannah fer is between 15 and
 
07:04:41.030 --> 07:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
22 for uh baggage and and checkout
 
07:04:43.628 --> 07:04:43.638 align:start position:0%
clerks Duncan's the lowest at between $
 
07:04:45.190 --> 07:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
13 and
 
07:04:47.510 --> 07:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
$18 so I would suggest that New
 
07:04:49.270 --> 07:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers are already doing
 
07:04:50.948 --> 07:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
this themselves they know what they need
 
07:04:53.230 --> 07:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
to do to
 
07:04:55.548 --> 07:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
employees New Hampshire does a lot of
 
07:04:58.150 --> 07:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
things that other states you know
 
07:04:59.590 --> 07:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't do a lot of things other states
 
07:05:01.190 --> 07:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
do we don't have a bottle Bill why
 
07:05:02.830 --> 07:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
because we recycle
 
07:05:04.910 --> 07:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves we don't have a mandatory
 
07:05:06.510 --> 07:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
insurance law but more people in New
 
07:05:08.388 --> 07:05:08.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have insurance than in states
 
07:05:11.388 --> 07:05:11.398 align:start position:0%
where it's mandatory employers know what
 
07:05:14.388 --> 07:05:14.398 align:start position:0%
they have to do to get
 
07:05:16.708 --> 07:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
employees the second part of the bill
 
07:05:18.708 --> 07:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
that is disconcerting to me has to do
 
07:05:21.788 --> 07:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
with the that this bill will increase
 
07:05:24.948 --> 07:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
every year with a New England Consumer
 
07:05:24.958 --> 07:05:26.270 align:start position:0%
every year with a New England Consumer
Price

07:05:26.270 --> 07:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
Price
 
07:05:29.830 --> 07:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
Index nothing for negative inflation but
 
07:05:32.270 --> 07:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
just for you know on a positive scale
 
07:05:34.310 --> 07:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
positive inflation you know I've always
 
07:05:36.030 --> 07:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
believed I was taught this a long time
 
07:05:37.670 --> 07:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
ago I've been hanging around these halls
 
07:05:40.350 --> 07:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
for almost 20 years now and when I was a
 
07:05:43.590 --> 07:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
young buck someone told
 
07:05:46.150 --> 07:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
me we
 
07:05:49.230 --> 07:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
don't shy away from our responsibilities
 
07:05:51.070 --> 07:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
to vote on things we don't let things
 
07:05:52.230 --> 07:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
just happen
 
07:05:54.430 --> 07:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
every year
 
07:05:56.510 --> 07:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
automatically I don't think we we should
 
07:05:58.310 --> 07:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
be passing something where increases
 
07:05:58.320 --> 07:05:59.230 align:start position:0%
be passing something where increases
happen

07:05:59.230 --> 07:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
happen
 
07:06:00.990 --> 07:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
automatically I don't like it when the
 
07:06:03.628 --> 07:06:03.638 align:start position:0%
United States Congress walks around and
 
07:06:07.270 --> 07:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
gets a raise every year and says oh we
 
07:06:09.708 --> 07:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
didn't vote for it it was automatic in
 
07:06:11.070 --> 07:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we
 
07:06:13.868 --> 07:06:13.878 align:start position:0%
vote so I would appreciate I'm I would
 
07:06:15.990 --> 07:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
like a roll call Mr Speaker but I'm
 
07:06:17.468 --> 07:06:17.478 align:start position:0%
asking my colleagues to vote against
 
07:06:17.478 --> 07:06:19.030 align:start position:0%
asking my colleagues to vote against
this

07:06:19.030 --> 07:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:06:26.548 --> 07:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:29.270 --> 07:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker our rise today in
 
07:06:31.150 --> 07:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
support of the ought to pass motion on
 
07:06:32.910 --> 07:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
07:06:35.708 --> 07:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
1322 this bill would gradually raise New
 
07:06:37.350 --> 07:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's minimum wage beginning with
 
07:06:39.150 --> 07:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
an increase to
 
07:06:41.990 --> 07:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
$99.50 followed by Modest yearly
 
07:06:45.190 --> 07:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
increases until it reaches $17 an hour
 
07:06:45.200 --> 07:06:46.430 align:start position:0%
increases until it reaches $17 an hour
in

07:06:46.430 --> 07:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:06:49.430 --> 07:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
2029 and then after that increases
 
07:06:51.788 --> 07:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
yearly based on the CPI which is what
 
07:06:54.910 --> 07:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
the states of Vermont and Maine do why
 
07:06:58.708 --> 07:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
$17 you might ask the MIT living wage
 
07:07:01.230 --> 07:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
calculator estimates that
 
07:07:04.110 --> 07:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
$17.23 an hour is what a single person
 
07:07:06.070 --> 07:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
needs to live a decent life in New
 
07:07:07.990 --> 07:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and isn't that what we want
 
07:07:09.388 --> 07:07:09.398 align:start position:0%
for all Granite
 
07:07:11.548 --> 07:07:11.558 align:start position:0%
Staters it is true that our current
 
07:07:13.590 --> 07:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
labor shortage has given workers The
 
07:07:16.110 --> 07:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
Leverage to demand higher wages but
 
07:07:17.910 --> 07:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's still one group of workers who
 
07:07:19.110 --> 07:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
can make
 
07:07:22.590 --> 07:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour tipped workers
 
07:07:24.670 --> 07:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
if a waitress in New Hampshire comes in
 
07:07:27.230 --> 07:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
on a quiet day and doesn't make much in
 
07:07:29.948 --> 07:07:29.958 align:start position:0%
tips the employer is required to make up
 
07:07:32.230 --> 07:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
their wages to the minimum wage of a
 
07:07:32.240 --> 07:07:35.150 align:start position:0%
their wages to the minimum wage of a
mere

07:07:35.150 --> 07:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:38.830 --> 07:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
$725 that same waitress would make $15
 
07:07:42.230 --> 07:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
for her time in Massachusetts and
 
07:07:45.190 --> 07:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
$14.15 in Maine and aren't our workers
 
07:07:47.270 --> 07:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
worth as much as workers in
 
07:07:50.430 --> 07:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine New Hampshire
 
07:07:53.750 --> 07:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
has not raised it minimum wage in 15
 
07:07:57.030 --> 07:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
years every state around us has by a lot
 
07:07:59.030 --> 07:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
and their economies have not
 
07:08:01.708 --> 07:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
collapsed if we want to grow our state's
 
07:08:04.310 --> 07:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
economy we need to attract and retain
 
07:08:07.070 --> 07:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
working people reestablishing and
 
07:08:09.070 --> 07:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage sends the
 
07:08:11.628 --> 07:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
message that we value our workers and
 
07:08:13.510 --> 07:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is a place where they
 
07:08:15.750 --> 07:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
can make a living and enjoy a good
 
07:08:19.788 --> 07:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
quality of life Mr Speaker when I vote
 
07:08:22.150 --> 07:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
for this bill I will will be thinking of
 
07:08:24.788 --> 07:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
the people who will benefit most the
 
07:08:27.230 --> 07:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
waitress who fills your coffee cup on a
 
07:08:29.948 --> 07:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
quiet Tuesday Morning the people who
 
07:08:31.910 --> 07:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
keep the convenience stores and gas
 
07:08:34.468 --> 07:08:34.478 align:start position:0%
stations open so you can get a gallon of
 
07:08:36.708 --> 07:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
milk when you need it or fill your tank
 
07:08:39.628 --> 07:08:39.638 align:start position:0%
when you come rolling in on fumes and
 
07:08:42.030 --> 07:08:42.040 align:start position:0%

get out of bed make sure she takes her
 
07:08:48.708 --> 07:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
medication and has a at least one good
 
07:08:52.150 --> 07:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
meal that day if you believe as I do
 
07:08:53.670 --> 07:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
that the
 
07:08:56.030 --> 07:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
124,000 workers in New Hampshire who
 
07:08:59.350 --> 07:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
make less than $17 an hour are important
 
07:09:01.990 --> 07:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
contributors to our state's economy and
 
07:09:03.868 --> 07:09:03.878 align:start position:0%
enhance the quality of life for all of
 
07:09:06.230 --> 07:09:06.240 align:start position:0%

infantine for a parliamentary
 
07:11:18.590 --> 07:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
07:11:21.430 --> 07:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that New Hampshire
 
07:11:24.110 --> 07:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
employers know what they need to do to
 
07:11:24.120 --> 07:11:25.070 align:start position:0%
employers know what they need to do to
attract

07:11:25.070 --> 07:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
attract
 
07:11:27.628 --> 07:11:27.638 align:start position:0%
employees and a vast majority are paying
 
07:11:30.270 --> 07:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
more per hour than what is proposed in
 
07:11:30.280 --> 07:11:31.230 align:start position:0%
more per hour than what is proposed in
this

07:11:31.230 --> 07:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:11:34.628 --> 07:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
legislation and Mr Speaker if I also
 
07:11:37.910 --> 07:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
know that this bill is tied to automatic
 
07:11:40.628 --> 07:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
increases with the New England consumer
 
07:11:42.270 --> 07:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
price index
 
07:11:44.788 --> 07:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
index and I don't feel that the
 
07:11:46.350 --> 07:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
legislature should have automatic
 
07:11:49.590 --> 07:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
increases we should sit and vote on any
 
07:11:52.030 --> 07:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
increases what I vote no on this Bill
 
07:11:53.830 --> 07:11:53.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
07:12:05.670 --> 07:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that a strong
 
07:12:08.270 --> 07:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
capitalism and a strong New Hampshire
 
07:12:10.628 --> 07:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
means we don't pay workers so poorly
 
07:12:12.830 --> 07:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
that they have to go on public
 
07:12:16.150 --> 07:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
assistance and if I know that too many
 
07:12:18.788 --> 07:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
workers can't afford rent food in the
 
07:12:18.798 --> 07:12:19.750 align:start position:0%
workers can't afford rent food in the

Granger thank you Mr Speaker this
 
07:21:54.468 --> 07:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
legislation is called right to work but
 
07:21:55.708 --> 07:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
it should be more it would be more
 
07:21:57.270 --> 07:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
accurate to call it the right to work
 
07:21:58.830 --> 07:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
and not have money from your paycheck
 
07:22:00.270 --> 07:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
stolen by people who have crippled your
 
07:22:02.590 --> 07:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
ability to independently negotiate who
 
07:22:02.600 --> 07:22:03.708 align:start position:0%
ability to independently negotiate who
then

07:22:03.708 --> 07:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:22:06.548 --> 07:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
act like they've done you a favor by
 
07:22:09.070 --> 07:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
doing so that's a bit long-winded but
 
07:22:11.230 --> 07:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
you get the point I am an independent
 
07:22:14.388 --> 07:22:14.398 align:start position:0%
worker I do not work in a union job I
 
07:22:16.230 --> 07:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
come from a long line of proud
 
07:22:19.150 --> 07:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
independent workers who also do not take
 
07:22:21.510 --> 07:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
union jobs
 
07:22:23.788 --> 07:22:23.798 align:start position:0%
I'm someone who isn't in a union and
 
07:22:25.708 --> 07:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
also supports right to work it's a
 
07:22:27.830 --> 07:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
change of pace for this
 
07:22:29.990 --> 07:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislation labor laws can be confusing
 
07:22:31.708 --> 07:22:31.718 align:start position:0%
so I'll provide a fairly clear example
 
07:22:34.468 --> 07:22:34.478 align:start position:0%
of why I support right to work let's say
 
07:22:36.708 --> 07:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
you work for a company and the workers
 
07:22:39.110 --> 07:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
form a union you're not in the union but
 
07:22:40.670 --> 07:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
they form a
 
07:22:44.190 --> 07:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
union let's say the union chooses the
 
07:22:47.468 --> 07:22:47.478 align:start position:0%
union chooses the member will be in
 
07:22:52.070 --> 07:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
order let's no talk
 
07:22:55.510 --> 07:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
about let's say that the union chooses
 
07:22:58.590 --> 07:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
for exclusive representation that means
 
07:23:01.150 --> 07:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
that they represent all employees even
 
07:23:03.628 --> 07:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
non-union employees the union chooses
 
07:23:06.190 --> 07:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
that question for you how would you go
 
07:23:08.708 --> 07:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
about independently negotiating your own
 
07:23:10.590 --> 07:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
wage and benefit package directly with
 
07:23:13.388 --> 07:23:13.398 align:start position:0%
the company answer you can't it's
 
07:23:15.948 --> 07:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
illegal you are not allowed to negotiate
 
07:23:17.910 --> 07:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
your own wages you are not allowed to
 
07:23:19.708 --> 07:23:19.718 align:start position:0%
negotiate your own benefit package as an
 
07:23:21.110 --> 07:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
independent depent worker you have had
 
07:23:24.150 --> 07:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
your agency stolen from you by Union
 
07:23:25.548 --> 07:23:25.558 align:start position:0%
that will then come to the labor
 
07:23:28.590 --> 07:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
committee and then call you a free rider
 
07:23:30.070 --> 07:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
they will come to my committee and they
 
07:23:31.788 --> 07:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
will come in droves to complain about
 
07:23:34.830 --> 07:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
independent workers like me who are Free
 
07:23:37.590 --> 07:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
Riders because we get the negotiated
 
07:23:40.030 --> 07:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
wage that they negotiated for them even
 
07:23:42.110 --> 07:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
if we don't want it even if we don't
 
07:23:44.030 --> 07:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
want their benefit package even if we
 
07:23:48.990 --> 07:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:51.030 --> 07:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
handouts they will come over and call
 
07:23:54.190 --> 07:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
you a free rider so regardless of how
 
07:23:56.190 --> 07:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
this vote goes know this evil is
 
07:23:58.628 --> 07:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
self-defeating private sector L labor
 
07:23:59.948 --> 07:23:59.958 align:start position:0%
unions who have relied on this
 
07:24:02.510 --> 07:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
Antiquated peculiar institution to stay
 
07:24:05.350 --> 07:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
alive are slowly disappearing there was
 
07:24:06.990 --> 07:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
a Time in America when almost half of
 
07:24:08.430 --> 07:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
all the workers were in a union we've
 
07:24:09.750 --> 07:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
now gotten to the point where the unions
 
07:24:11.628 --> 07:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
have driven away the majority of those
 
07:24:14.110 --> 07:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
they represent and now only 10% of
 
07:24:16.708 --> 07:24:16.718 align:start position:0%
workers are in a union what more most of
 
07:24:18.590 --> 07:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
these workers are in the public sector
 
07:24:21.910 --> 07:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
which already has right to work thanks
 
07:24:24.430 --> 07:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
to the Janice decision on top of that
 
07:24:26.548 --> 07:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
not every private sector Union engages
 
07:24:28.510 --> 07:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
in the practice of forcing non-union
 
07:24:31.548 --> 07:24:31.558 align:start position:0%
members to subsidize the unions some
 
07:24:33.388 --> 07:24:33.398 align:start position:0%
actually try to provide a decent service
 
07:24:35.308 --> 07:24:35.318 align:start position:0%
to their members without needlessly
 
07:24:37.030 --> 07:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
resorting to throwing independent
 
07:24:39.230 --> 07:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
workers under the bus we will bring this
 
07:24:40.868 --> 07:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
bill back every two years until it
 
07:24:43.070 --> 07:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
either passes or until this unethical
 
07:24:44.948 --> 07:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
practice stops if you want to not listen
 
07:24:47.590 --> 07:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
to this debate ever again please oppose
 
07:24:55.270 --> 07:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:08.590 --> 07:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:10.750 --> 07:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
postponed the motion before us is
 
07:25:13.628 --> 07:25:13.638 align:start position:0%
indefinitely postpone House Bill
 
07:25:17.548 --> 07:25:17.558 align:start position:0%
1377 this is a roll call
 
07:25:29.788 --> 07:25:29.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:34.990 --> 07:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:38.150 --> 07:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
Clark thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
07:25:39.628 --> 07:25:39.638 align:start position:0%
might not have as much experience here
 
07:25:41.750 --> 07:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the state house as most of you but I
 
07:25:43.350 --> 07:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
do have experience in opposing this
 
07:25:44.548 --> 07:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
Right to Work bill as I've been a
 
07:25:47.388 --> 07:25:47.398 align:start position:0%
carpenter in the carers union for 28
 
07:25:47.398 --> 07:25:48.270 align:start position:0%
carpenter in the carers union for 28
years

07:25:48.270 --> 07:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:25:51.308 --> 07:25:51.318 align:start position:0%
now I reached to WS they asked when
 
07:25:53.150 --> 07:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
Right to Work legislation was first
 
07:25:55.510 --> 07:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
introduced to this body it was told that
 
07:25:57.308 --> 07:25:57.318 align:start position:0%
the first substantia bill was introduced
 
07:25:57.318 --> 07:25:58.468 align:start position:0%
the first substantia bill was introduced
in

07:25:58.468 --> 07:25:58.478 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:26:01.590 --> 07:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
1979 when introduced I was 16 going on
 
07:26:03.430 --> 07:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
17 years old but didn't do much about
 
07:26:05.708 --> 07:26:05.718 align:start position:0%
unions except that my dad was a member
 
07:26:06.708 --> 07:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
of the
 
07:26:08.830 --> 07:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
teamsters he was a root salesman for
 
07:26:10.590 --> 07:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
Sunbeam bread working out of Cody
 
07:26:13.628 --> 07:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
Brothers Bakery in Manchester and uh if
 
07:26:15.230 --> 07:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
you grew up in and around Manchester you
 
07:26:17.430 --> 07:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
might have gone down South Elm Street
 
07:26:19.270 --> 07:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
roll your windows down and smell fresh
 
07:26:20.628 --> 07:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
baked bread
 
07:26:22.910 --> 07:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
it was awesome I remember those
 
07:26:26.388 --> 07:26:26.398 align:start position:0%
days so in 1980 I earned my PhD that's
 
07:26:28.230 --> 07:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
my public high school
 
07:26:30.628 --> 07:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
diploma from Manchester Memorial High
 
07:26:33.070 --> 07:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
School I only mention this because at
 
07:26:35.430 --> 07:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
the time the teamsters were having
 
07:26:37.230 --> 07:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
issues with those that were not in favor
 
07:26:39.510 --> 07:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
of unions I don't remember all the
 
07:26:41.788 --> 07:26:41.798 align:start position:0%
details but I do know that my dad got
 
07:26:44.590 --> 07:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
called to write shotgun literally in
 
07:26:46.270 --> 07:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
case an overnight delivery got
 
07:26:48.430 --> 07:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
interrupted because of this he missed my
 
07:26:50.670 --> 07:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
high school graduation now you might be
 
07:26:52.708 --> 07:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
thinking why would a father miss their
 
07:26:55.070 --> 07:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
oldest son's graduation and you know
 
07:26:57.868 --> 07:26:57.878 align:start position:0%
what I kind of thought that too but then
 
07:26:59.430 --> 07:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
we talked about it when he got home and
 
07:27:01.868 --> 07:27:01.878 align:start position:0%
I understood that he did what he had to
 
07:27:04.548 --> 07:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
do he obviously didn't want to miss my
 
07:27:06.030 --> 07:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
high school graduation but he also
 
07:27:07.750 --> 07:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want to lose what was fought by
 
07:27:10.388 --> 07:27:10.398 align:start position:0%
so many before him those who had made
 
07:27:12.788 --> 07:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
huge sacrifices for the greater good he
 
07:27:14.110 --> 07:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
was proud of the fact that being a
 
07:27:17.150 --> 07:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
Teamster allowed him to provide for his
 
07:27:19.270 --> 07:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
wife and four sons and was not about to
 
07:27:21.750 --> 07:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
let anyone won't take that away from him
 
07:27:23.388 --> 07:27:23.398 align:start position:0%
when I graduated from trade school a few
 
07:27:26.468 --> 07:27:26.478 align:start position:0%
years later he was able to make that he
 
07:27:29.190 --> 07:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
remained a Teamster even when he changed
 
07:27:31.270 --> 07:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
um careers and started working for the
 
07:27:33.750 --> 07:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department we lost him
 
07:27:36.548 --> 07:27:36.558 align:start position:0%
in 2011 after fighting long and hard
 
07:27:38.150 --> 07:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
against two different cancers and then
 
07:27:41.590 --> 07:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
finally succumbing to
 
07:27:44.468 --> 07:27:44.478 align:start position:0%
leukemia at the rip old age of 66 by the
 
07:27:45.990 --> 07:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
way just one month before he was going
 
07:27:46.000 --> 07:27:46.750 align:start position:0%
way just one month before he was going
to

07:27:46.750 --> 07:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:27:49.030 --> 07:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
retire thanks to the MPD and the
 
07:27:51.230 --> 07:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
teamsters his benefits paid for all the
 
07:27:53.150 --> 07:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
medications and treat treatments he had
 
07:27:55.868 --> 07:27:55.878 align:start position:0%
to deal with along the way they stayed
 
07:27:58.230 --> 07:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
by his side until the end and because
 
07:28:00.590 --> 07:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
his wife was able to receive his pension
 
07:28:02.910 --> 07:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
she was able to stay in their home until
 
07:28:06.150 --> 07:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
we lost her just a little over a year
 
07:28:09.830 --> 07:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
ago in 1995 my wife Francine and I had
 
07:28:12.230 --> 07:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
our Second Son I'd been working in
 
07:28:14.110 --> 07:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
construction for open SHOP Company since
 
07:28:16.910 --> 07:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
the mid 80s before during and after
 
07:28:19.708 --> 07:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
going to trade school I was tired of
 
07:28:21.430 --> 07:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
begging for lame raises and getting
 
07:28:24.308 --> 07:28:24.318 align:start position:0%
terrible benefits that I had to pay for
 
07:28:26.628 --> 07:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
my wife and I with a wife and two young
 
07:28:28.670 --> 07:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
Sons I knew that I needed to make a
 
07:28:31.110 --> 07:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
change my brother-in-law had just joined
 
07:28:32.868 --> 07:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
the Carpenters Union suggested I'd do
 
07:28:34.430 --> 07:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
the same so I
 
07:28:36.990 --> 07:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
did my only regret was that I waited
 
07:28:39.350 --> 07:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
till I was 33 years old and didn't do it
 
07:28:43.468 --> 07:28:43.478 align:start position:0%
at 23 years old fast forward to today
 
07:28:47.190 --> 07:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
I'm 61 years old this close to retiring
 
07:28:49.308 --> 07:28:49.318 align:start position:0%
I have a full pension in annuity waiting
 
07:28:51.990 --> 07:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
for Francine and me to carry us through
 
07:28:54.230 --> 07:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
our retirement years I've been paying
 
07:28:54.240 --> 07:28:55.750 align:start position:0%
our retirement years I've been paying
dues

07:28:55.750 --> 07:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
dues
 
07:28:57.910 --> 07:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
voluntarily for all those years because
 
07:29:00.110 --> 07:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
I know the rate of return we'll receive
 
07:29:02.350 --> 07:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
cannot be matched by any financial
 
07:29:04.548 --> 07:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
institution there's no way we could have
 
07:29:06.708 --> 07:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
saved up what we're going to get in our
 
07:29:09.510 --> 07:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
retirement years this legislation
 
07:29:12.150 --> 07:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes all of that even with its
 
07:29:14.110 --> 07:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
misleading title we can all agree that
 
07:29:16.230 --> 07:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
everyone has the right to work but I
 
07:29:17.948 --> 07:29:17.958 align:start position:0%
really hope that everyone in this room
 
07:29:19.750 --> 07:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
knows that this bill has nothing to do
 
07:29:22.628 --> 07:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
with that make no mistake the only
 
07:29:25.788 --> 07:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
intent of HB 1377 is to destroy unions
 
07:29:28.510 --> 07:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
and what many many long before us have
 
07:29:32.628 --> 07:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
fought and died for safe wages safe
 
07:29:34.468 --> 07:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
working conditions and a chance to
 
07:29:37.830 --> 07:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
retire with dignity just to name a few
 
07:29:39.270 --> 07:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
even though the federal government
 
07:29:41.548 --> 07:29:41.558 align:start position:0%
already protects workers Freedom not to
 
07:29:45.150 --> 07:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
join a union HB 1377 wants to give some
 
07:29:47.948 --> 07:29:47.958 align:start position:0%
workers a free ride by allowing anti-un
 
07:29:50.788 --> 07:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
workers to opt out of paying any fees
 
07:29:52.468 --> 07:29:52.478 align:start position:0%
but still be able to receive all the
 
07:29:55.270 --> 07:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and by law Union representation
 
07:29:57.590 --> 07:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
would still be provided even a
 
07:29:59.830 --> 07:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
business's largest Planet Fitness would
 
07:30:02.948 --> 07:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
not survive if nobody paid fees to be a
 
07:30:05.230 --> 07:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
member during the two days of hearings
 
07:30:06.788 --> 07:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
at the labor committee the best
 
07:30:08.670 --> 07:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
Committee in the house Mr
 
07:30:11.830 --> 07:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker we heard we heard testimony from
 
07:30:13.868 --> 07:30:13.878 align:start position:0%
the executive director for Northeast
 
07:30:15.910 --> 07:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
citizens for Right to Work who are
 
07:30:16.990 --> 07:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
really from
 
07:30:20.030 --> 07:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
Virginia his written testimony stated
 
07:30:22.070 --> 07:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
the facts show businesses are naturally
 
07:30:25.030 --> 07:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
inclined to locate new jobs in and when
 
07:30:27.590 --> 07:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
feasible transfer existing jobs to
 
07:30:30.350 --> 07:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
states where right to work is protected
 
07:30:32.708 --> 07:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
when we asked for proof none was
 
07:30:34.948 --> 07:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
provided we do know that Republican
 
07:30:36.910 --> 07:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
Governor Jim Justice pushed to pass a
 
07:30:38.670 --> 07:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
right to work law promising he would
 
07:30:41.990 --> 07:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
bring new jobs but in February of 2021
 
07:30:43.830 --> 07:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
about half an hour or so into a town
 
07:30:46.270 --> 07:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
meeting he admitted really and truly
 
07:30:48.788 --> 07:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
let's be brutally honest we passed the
 
07:30:50.990 --> 07:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
right to work law in West Virginia and
 
07:30:52.910 --> 07:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
we ran to the windows looking to see all
 
07:30:55.430 --> 07:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
the people that were going to come and
 
07:30:56.548 --> 07:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
they didn't
 
07:30:58.910 --> 07:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
come last Thursday during the State of
 
07:31:00.670 --> 07:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
the State address Governor sonunu said
 
07:31:02.110 --> 07:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
that many businesses have come to New
 
07:31:03.990 --> 07:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and were not a right to work
 
07:31:08.070 --> 07:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
state and as of February 13 2014 I mean
 
07:31:11.948 --> 07:31:11.958 align:start position:0%
2024 just last week after 50 plus years
 
07:31:14.468 --> 07:31:14.478 align:start position:0%
of being a right to work state Michigan
 
07:31:17.030 --> 07:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
is no longer a right to work
 
07:31:19.590 --> 07:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
state we also heard from the president
 
07:31:22.030 --> 07:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
CEO the house will be in order thank you
 
07:31:24.510 --> 07:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker we also heard from the
 
07:31:26.548 --> 07:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
president and CEO of associated builders
 
07:31:29.150 --> 07:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
and contractors that's the ABC who
 
07:31:32.468 --> 07:31:32.478 align:start position:0%
represents many dues paying construction
 
07:31:34.990 --> 07:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
firms he testified that in New Hampshire
 
07:31:38.070 --> 07:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
union bosses use violence coercion and
 
07:31:40.270 --> 07:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
intimidation to force people to join
 
07:31:43.308 --> 07:31:43.318 align:start position:0%
unions as a former Union
 
07:31:46.750 --> 07:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
boss I uh resent those
 
07:31:49.430 --> 07:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
remarks and again when asked for proof
 
07:31:51.750 --> 07:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
none was brought forth I'd like to point
 
07:31:53.868 --> 07:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
out that our union bosses here in New
 
07:31:56.230 --> 07:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have helped many open shop
 
07:31:58.948 --> 07:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
Carpenters get compensation owed to them
 
07:32:00.708 --> 07:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
working with the state do we got them
 
07:32:03.670 --> 07:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
the money they earn sometimes thousands
 
07:32:05.350 --> 07:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
because we believe in protecting all
 
07:32:07.670 --> 07:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
workers rights and when you work you get
 
07:32:12.308 --> 07:32:12.318 align:start position:0%
paid Union or not the ABC also testified
 
07:32:14.070 --> 07:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
that Union construction workers can only
 
07:32:15.830 --> 07:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
make with their contract States and need
 
07:32:18.868 --> 07:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
to beg the union boss for more money
 
07:32:22.270 --> 07:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
again hurtful but not
 
07:32:24.910 --> 07:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
true the rate of pay in our contract is
 
07:32:27.388 --> 07:32:27.398 align:start position:0%
a minimum amount if a carer would like
 
07:32:29.230 --> 07:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
to earn more he or she can work with
 
07:32:32.030 --> 07:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
their employer to do so no Union boss
 
07:32:35.308 --> 07:32:35.318 align:start position:0%
involved by the way Union corporate's
 
07:32:37.670 --> 07:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is way higher than the open
 
07:32:40.670 --> 07:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
shop Center's minimum wage of 725 an
 
07:32:43.430 --> 07:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
hour colleagues let's be clear the
 
07:32:45.350 --> 07:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
reality is that right to work isn't just
 
07:32:47.150 --> 07:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
wrong for New Hampshire workers it's
 
07:32:49.590 --> 07:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
also wrong for New Hampshire businesses
 
07:32:50.670 --> 07:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
at the hearings and through
 
07:32:52.868 --> 07:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
correspondence we heard from firms that
 
07:32:54.910 --> 07:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
employ thousands of New Hampshire
 
07:32:57.070 --> 07:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
workers they were clear in telling us
 
07:32:59.270 --> 07:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
that right to work is bad for business
 
07:33:00.430 --> 07:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
because it will intrude in their
 
07:33:02.388 --> 07:33:02.398 align:start position:0%
business's ability to freely negotiate
 
07:33:04.788 --> 07:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
contracts that they determine are in
 
07:33:07.430 --> 07:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
their best interest to their
 
07:33:09.670 --> 07:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
companies they expressed dismay that
 
07:33:11.548 --> 07:33:11.558 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the Live Free or
 
07:33:14.308 --> 07:33:14.318 align:start position:0%
Die state that this legislative body
 
07:33:15.868 --> 07:33:15.878 align:start position:0%
would pass a law that mandates
 
07:33:17.548 --> 07:33:17.558 align:start position:0%
government interference in the free
 
07:33:19.750 --> 07:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
market they also point pointed out that
 
07:33:21.628 --> 07:33:21.638 align:start position:0%
passing right to work will harm our
 
07:33:23.708 --> 07:33:23.718 align:start position:0%
communities because studies show states
 
07:33:25.308 --> 07:33:25.318 align:start position:0%
that have passed Right to Work have
 
07:33:27.948 --> 07:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
lower wages higher rates of job site
 
07:33:30.468 --> 07:33:30.478 align:start position:0%
injuries and death lower rates of Health
 
07:33:32.590 --> 07:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
Care coverage and higher rates of
 
07:33:34.670 --> 07:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
poverty pushing more people toward
 
07:33:36.708 --> 07:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance is not something they
 
07:33:39.150 --> 07:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
and I hope we can all agree is not good
 
07:33:41.990 --> 07:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
for our state Mr Speaker I could
 
07:33:43.830 --> 07:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
continue pointing out the untruths told
 
07:33:45.628 --> 07:33:45.638 align:start position:0%
by the folks in favor of right to work
 
07:33:47.030 --> 07:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
but I would like to just point out two
 
07:33:50.788 --> 07:33:50.798 align:start position:0%
more things before closing
 
07:33:54.750 --> 07:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
first while executing hp37 it was said
 
07:33:57.150 --> 07:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
in the best Committee in the house that
 
07:33:58.788 --> 07:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
unions are irrelevant and probably won't
 
07:34:01.548 --> 07:34:01.558 align:start position:0%
be around in 50 years if that was true
 
07:34:03.388 --> 07:34:03.398 align:start position:0%
why the hell are so many anti-union
 
07:34:05.750 --> 07:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
organizations like the afor mention
 
07:34:07.670 --> 07:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
working so diligently and spending so
 
07:34:10.230 --> 07:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
much money to get rid of them I'll wager
 
07:34:13.468 --> 07:34:13.478 align:start position:0%
my entire gross salary for this session
 
07:34:15.190 --> 07:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the members of this house receive
 
07:34:17.110 --> 07:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
more correspondence in opposition to
 
07:34:19.830 --> 07:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
this Bill from True voting New Hampshire
 
07:34:22.788 --> 07:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
constituents than those in support I'm
 
07:34:24.308 --> 07:34:24.318 align:start position:0%
confident in this wager because more
 
07:34:26.830 --> 07:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
than after more than 5 hours of P
 
07:34:29.868 --> 07:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
testimony over two days more than 1,400
 
07:34:31.750 --> 07:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
members of the public either spoke or
 
07:34:34.150 --> 07:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
registered their opposition to
 
07:34:37.990 --> 07:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
1377 while less than 50 spoke in
 
07:34:40.750 --> 07:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
positive secondly this body gets
 
07:34:42.510 --> 07:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
together to debate and vote on whether
 
07:34:44.270 --> 07:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
or not a bill introduced from committee
 
07:34:47.230 --> 07:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
should become law typically bad bills go
 
07:34:49.070 --> 07:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
no further no matter how many times
 
07:34:51.388 --> 07:34:51.398 align:start position:0%
times or in what form they're introduced
 
07:34:52.948 --> 07:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and the opinion of
 
07:34:55.708 --> 07:34:55.718 align:start position:0%
legislators over the past 40 plus years
 
07:34:58.150 --> 07:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
no matter which side had the majority
 
07:35:00.190 --> 07:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
this is once again a bad Bill that
 
07:35:03.590 --> 07:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
should not go any further Mr Speaker I
 
07:35:05.350 --> 07:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that we all push the
 
07:35:07.868 --> 07:35:07.878 align:start position:0%
red button I mean the green button to
 
07:35:07.878 --> 07:35:09.110 align:start position:0%
red button I mean the green button to
indefinitely

07:35:09.110 --> 07:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
indefinitely
 
07:35:11.788 --> 07:35:11.798 align:start position:0%
postpone like so many before us at the
 
07:35:13.590 --> 07:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
request of our voting New Hampshire
 
07:35:16.510 --> 07:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
constituents let's all prove again that
 
07:35:19.750 --> 07:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
right to work in HB 1377 are wrong for
 
07:35:21.990 --> 07:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wrong for New Hampshire
 
07:35:23.830 --> 07:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
businesses and wrong for all the
 
07:35:25.350 --> 07:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of this great state of New
 
07:35:27.708 --> 07:35:27.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Mr Speaker I also respectfully
 
07:35:30.868 --> 07:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
ask for a division vote it's already a
 
07:35:30.878 --> 07:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
ask for a division vote it's already a
roll

07:35:31.990 --> 07:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
roll
 
07:35:38.670 --> 07:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:41.150 --> 07:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
motion members take your seats this is
 
07:35:43.910 --> 07:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to be a roll call
 
07:35:46.270 --> 07:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
vote the motion before us is inde
 
07:35:49.708 --> 07:35:49.718 align:start position:0%
defitely postpone House Bill 1377 it's a
 
07:36:17.110 --> 07:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:35.350 --> 07:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:36.830 --> 07:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is definitely
 
07:36:39.308 --> 07:36:39.318 align:start position:0%
postponement for House Bill 1377 this is
 
07:36:41.030 --> 07:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote chair recognized
 
07:36:47.110 --> 07:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:50.030 --> 07:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:36:54.510 --> 07:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
07:36:57.030 --> 07:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
body has been killing right to work for
 
07:36:58.468 --> 07:36:58.478 align:start position:0%
over 40
 
07:37:02.308 --> 07:37:02.318 align:start position:0%
years and if I know that over 1,400
 
07:37:04.628 --> 07:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
people signed in in opposition to right
 
07:37:08.350 --> 07:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
to work and only 50 signed in in favor
 
07:37:12.468 --> 07:37:12.478 align:start position:0%
of it and if I know that right to work
 
07:37:15.070 --> 07:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
is wrong for New Hampshire then would I
 
07:37:17.230 --> 07:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
press the green button in favor of
 
07:37:20.670 --> 07:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement thank you chair
 
07:37:23.708 --> 07:37:23.718 align:start position:0%
recognize represent P papuchi Miller for
 
07:37:23.718 --> 07:37:26.388 align:start position:0%
recognize represent P papuchi Miller for
parliamentary

07:37:26.388 --> 07:37:26.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:29.510 --> 07:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know that many
 
07:37:31.990 --> 07:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
workers do not want a union job and this
 
07:37:33.868 --> 07:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
bill protects the right of every worker
 
07:37:36.070 --> 07:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
to choose to join a union and pay for
 
07:37:38.910 --> 07:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
their services or not if I know that
 
07:37:40.548 --> 07:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
this bill would eliminate restrictions
 
07:37:42.910 --> 07:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
on the freedoms of indid individuals and
 
07:37:45.388 --> 07:37:45.398 align:start position:0%
businesses alike allowing them to choose
 
07:37:46.990 --> 07:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
what is best for them without being
 
07:37:49.628 --> 07:37:49.638 align:start position:0%
coerced into different choices
 
07:37:51.910 --> 07:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
if I know that the so-called Free Riders
 
07:37:54.468 --> 07:37:54.478 align:start position:0%
are a myth since the nlr explicitly
 
07:37:57.308 --> 07:37:57.318 align:start position:0%
allows unions to negotiate members only
 
07:37:59.590 --> 07:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
contracts which do not require unions to
 
07:38:02.910 --> 07:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
represent non-members and lastly if I
 
07:38:05.270 --> 07:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
know that there is no doubt that forcing
 
07:38:07.308 --> 07:38:07.318 align:start position:0%
someone to pay to exercise a
 
07:38:09.510 --> 07:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional right is a clear
 
07:38:11.590 --> 07:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
interference with their rights would I
 
07:38:13.308 --> 07:38:13.318 align:start position:0%
then press the red button so that a

07:50:50.830 --> 07:50:50.840 align:start position:0%

federal and state agencies when it
 
07:50:57.308 --> 07:50:57.318 align:start position:0%
became apparent that our state forestry

the work on the national forest or at

being

07:51:04.270 --> 07:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
being
 
07:51:06.868 --> 07:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
interpreted I drafted an amendment it's
 
07:51:09.430 --> 07:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
in your uh seat Pockets that uh
 
07:51:11.190 --> 07:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was not considered by the
 
07:51:13.430 --> 07:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee this amendment would reduce
 
07:51:13.440 --> 07:51:14.270 align:start position:0%
committee this amendment would reduce

over

07:51:18.150 --> 07:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
over

little over 200,000 Acres of State
 
07:51:25.070 --> 07:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
managed park lands this reduction in
 
07:51:26.868 --> 07:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
scope will reduce the need for
 
07:51:28.910 --> 07:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
additional staff from 7 to two we heard
 
07:51:30.750 --> 07:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
from the Department in the public
 
07:51:34.388 --> 07:51:34.398 align:start position:0%
hearing old growth forests are receiving
 
07:51:36.150 --> 07:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
scrutiny as we seek to fight the threat

of climate
 
07:51:39.628 --> 07:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
change it's a given now that in terms of
 
07:51:41.070 --> 07:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
fighting climate change not only are we
 
07:51:42.230 --> 07:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
07:51:45.350 --> 07:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
to uh give up our addiction to fossil
 
07:51:46.590 --> 07:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
fuels but we're also going to have to
 
07:51:48.430 --> 07:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
draw down a sign significant portion of
 
07:51:50.750 --> 07:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
the carbon currently in the atmosphere
 
07:51:52.150 --> 07:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
due to human
 
07:51:54.388 --> 07:51:54.398 align:start position:0%
activities this need to take carbon back
 
07:51:55.948 --> 07:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
out of the atmosphere is leading to a
 
07:51:58.468 --> 07:51:58.478 align:start position:0%
rethink of the best and most valued use
 
07:52:00.670 --> 07:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
of our forest lands New Hampshire is
 
07:52:02.830 --> 07:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
uniquely blessed as we know with
 
07:52:04.750 --> 07:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
abundant Forest cover and that's why we
 
07:52:07.430 --> 07:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to play a crucial
 
07:52:10.070 --> 07:52:10.080 align:start position:0%

States absorb 133% of our carbon

emissions and if we let them continue to
 
07:52:36.308 --> 07:52:36.318 align:start position:0%
grow they could do so much more that's
 
07:52:37.830 --> 07:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
what this bill is intended to do on
 
07:52:39.590 --> 07:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of the people the owners of the
 
07:52:42.030 --> 07:52:42.040 align:start position:0%

07:52:44.388 --> 07:52:44.398 align:start position:0%
mature forests on public lands that have
 
07:52:47.468 --> 07:52:47.478 align:start position:0%
the potential to be most useful and to
 
07:52:48.948 --> 07:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
map them so that we know what we have
 
07:52:51.110 --> 07:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
and how best to manage what is ours and
 
07:52:51.120 --> 07:52:52.110 align:start position:0%
and how best to manage what is ours and
ours

07:52:52.110 --> 07:52:52.120 align:start position:0%

07:52:54.948 --> 07:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
alone so please vote r on this
 
07:52:57.070 --> 07:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement so that we can
 
07:52:59.030 --> 07:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment and the
 
07:53:01.708 --> 07:53:01.718 align:start position:0%

Speaker we broadly opposed this

particular Amendment and also the things
 
07:53:28.548 --> 07:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for mainly because we
 
07:53:30.548 --> 07:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
heard from the New Hampshire forestry

growth a mature forest in addition
 
07:54:23.350 --> 07:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
inventorying Mappy old growth will take
 
07:54:25.990 --> 07:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of time staff and resources more
 
07:54:28.110 --> 07:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
than what's been depicted on that fiscal
 
07:54:31.270 --> 07:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
note so please understand that there's
 
07:54:34.468 --> 07:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
no scientific basis for the universal
 
07:54:37.030 --> 07:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
definition of mature or old growth
 
07:54:39.190 --> 07:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
because some of our forests have slow
 
07:54:43.150 --> 07:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
growth happening in Old growth New
 
07:54:46.190 --> 07:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire forests so this bill we need
 
07:54:47.708 --> 07:54:47.718 align:start position:0%

forests are among New Hampshire's most
 
07:57:57.030 --> 07:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
precious resources and if I know that
 
07:57:59.670 --> 07:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
collecting data on the maturity and
 
07:58:03.548 --> 07:58:03.558 align:start position:0%

our ability to mitigate floods droughts
 
07:58:11.308 --> 07:58:11.318 align:start position:0%

07:58:13.708 --> 07:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
want New Hampshire to join our
 
07:58:16.110 --> 07:58:16.120 align:start position:0%

Service in inv inventorying State Forest
 
07:58:23.230 --> 07:58:23.240 align:start position:0%

07:59:10.510 --> 07:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
meeting the state's obligation expressed
 
07:59:12.388 --> 07:59:12.398 align:start position:0%

$2,240 th000 over a threeyear
 
07:59:29.990 --> 07:59:30.000 align:start position:0%

08:05:08.948 --> 08:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
the NRC which oversees the sighting and
 
08:05:12.868 --> 08:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
installation of any new nuclear energy
 
08:05:17.150 --> 08:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
facilities it is as clear as mud how the
 
08:05:19.628 --> 08:05:19.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy would
 
08:05:21.308 --> 08:05:21.318 align:start position:0%
interact with the
 
08:05:25.308 --> 08:05:25.318 align:start position:0%
NRC and who would own what roles in any
 
08:05:26.628 --> 08:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
08:05:29.430 --> 08:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
process New Hampshire already has a
 
08:05:32.190 --> 08:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
nuclear facility and supposedly it is
 
08:05:34.750 --> 08:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
already being overseen by the staff at
 
08:05:37.628 --> 08:05:37.638 align:start position:0%
the department of energy so why the need
 
08:05:39.830 --> 08:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
for an entire office to oversee a
 
08:05:42.070 --> 08:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
process that wouldn't be needed for
 
08:05:45.948 --> 08:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
several years let's talk about funding
 
08:05:48.750 --> 08:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
this Bill if passed wouldn't be
 
08:05:50.270 --> 08:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
effective until
 
08:05:52.708 --> 08:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
2025 which is why there is the claim
 
08:05:55.270 --> 08:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
that there is no funding for this bill
 
08:05:57.868 --> 08:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
however this little backdoor bill would
 
08:06:01.270 --> 08:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
require eventual funding and Personnel
 
08:06:03.830 --> 08:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
hiring in order to staff the new office
 
08:06:06.190 --> 08:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
with people who have nuclear
 
08:06:08.868 --> 08:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
experience someone will need to fund
 
08:06:12.230 --> 08:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
those positions starting in
 
08:06:14.430 --> 08:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
2025 the New Hampshire Department of
 
08:06:16.350 --> 08:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
energy gave testimony that they would
 
08:06:18.670 --> 08:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
need additional staff to cover the new
 
08:06:22.548 --> 08:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
roles outlined in this bill workers come
 
08:06:26.270 --> 08:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
with a cost and nuclear experts do not
 
08:06:26.280 --> 08:06:27.150 align:start position:0%
with a cost and nuclear experts do not
come

08:06:27.150 --> 08:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
come
 
08:06:29.990 --> 08:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
cheap and let us not forget that we have
 
08:06:32.150 --> 08:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
been warned by the house finance
 
08:06:34.190 --> 08:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee that any bills with fiscal
 
08:06:37.230 --> 08:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
notes will not continue this calendar
 
08:06:39.030 --> 08:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
year and that we should expect to be
 
08:06:42.788 --> 08:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
quote disappointed at the outcome of any
 
08:06:42.798 --> 08:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
quote disappointed at the outcome of any
such

08:06:43.750 --> 08:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
such
 
08:06:46.388 --> 08:06:46.398 align:start position:0%
Bill during committee discussion we
 
08:06:47.910 --> 08:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
heard that this bill would essentially
 
08:06:51.230 --> 08:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
be putting a sign out for all businesses
 
08:06:55.788 --> 08:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
to see that says New Hampshire welcomes
 
08:06:58.030 --> 08:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear come on
 
08:07:00.990 --> 08:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
down but with the permits and planning
 
08:07:03.388 --> 08:07:03.398 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done for any nuclear
 
08:07:06.868 --> 08:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
facility New Hampshire is a good 10
 
08:07:10.230 --> 08:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
years that's 10 years away from any
 
08:07:13.628 --> 08:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plant a
 
08:07:16.510 --> 08:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
decade are we really going to create an
 
08:07:18.750 --> 08:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
office of nuclear oversight that will be
 
08:07:22.868 --> 08:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
paid to sit for 10 years before anything
 
08:07:25.308 --> 08:07:25.318 align:start position:0%
happens yet another problem with this
 
08:07:27.468 --> 08:07:27.478 align:start position:0%
bill is that it calls for participation
 
08:07:30.750 --> 08:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
of the Public Utilities Commission on on
 
08:07:33.670 --> 08:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
any nuclear energy projects which is
 
08:07:37.430 --> 08:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
just not in their purview they don't do
 
08:07:40.750 --> 08:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
that the pu's mission is to Ure that
 
08:07:43.990 --> 08:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
customers of regulated utilities receive
 
08:07:46.070 --> 08:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
safe adequate and reliable service
 
08:07:49.670 --> 08:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
service at just and reasonable
 
08:07:53.070 --> 08:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
costs lastly we already have an energy
 
08:07:56.708 --> 08:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
sighting of an energy facility sighting
 
08:07:59.350 --> 08:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
process in New Hampshire and it is
 
08:08:02.110 --> 08:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
unclear what if anything else is needed
 
08:08:04.070 --> 08:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
for any new nuclear
 
08:08:07.510 --> 08:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
business House Bill 1645 is a bill that
 
08:08:11.510 --> 08:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
requires significant study revision and
 
08:08:14.468 --> 08:08:14.478 align:start position:0%
work before ever being passed by the
 
08:08:17.548 --> 08:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
Full House I urge you to oppose the
 
08:08:19.150 --> 08:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
current motion of
 
08:08:23.948 --> 08:08:23.958 align:start position:0%
OTP and instead please kill this bill so
 
08:08:26.030 --> 08:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
that we can go home thank you does a
 
08:08:28.468 --> 08:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
member yield the
 
08:08:32.070 --> 08:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
questions no member does not yield chair
 
08:08:42.830 --> 08:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:44.910 --> 08:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr
 
08:08:44.920 --> 08:08:47.990 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr
Speaker

08:08:47.990 --> 08:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:49.910 --> 08:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to clear up some uh
 
08:08:52.510 --> 08:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
misconceptions from the the
 
08:08:56.070 --> 08:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
prev thank you Mr
 
08:08:58.230 --> 08:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker I'm going to clear up some
 
08:09:01.190 --> 08:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
misconceptions uh of the previous
 
08:09:04.190 --> 08:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
speaker um the the claim that this bill
 
08:09:05.788 --> 08:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
requires further
 
08:09:09.230 --> 08:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
study this bill is uh a product of a
 
08:09:11.868 --> 08:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
study commission that this body created
 
08:09:14.388 --> 08:09:14.398 align:start position:0%
two years ago and that ran the entire
 
08:09:16.708 --> 08:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
entirety of last year to
 
08:09:19.350 --> 08:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
2023 and on that commission we had the
 
08:09:22.230 --> 08:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
chair of the Pu the general Council of
 
08:09:24.510 --> 08:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy uh a
 
08:09:26.030 --> 08:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative from the Bureau of
 
08:09:29.590 --> 08:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
Economic Development uh energy experts
 
08:09:32.990 --> 08:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
we brought in federal experts industry
 
08:09:35.388 --> 08:09:35.398 align:start position:0%
experts manufacturers of advanced
 
08:09:38.190 --> 08:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
nuclear you can read our 50-page report
 
08:09:41.388 --> 08:09:41.398 align:start position:0%
if you go to nuclear n. energy and this
 
08:09:43.070 --> 08:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
bill is in one of the recommendations on
 
08:09:45.270 --> 08:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
that report so I'll get into what this
 
08:09:46.510 --> 08:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
08:09:51.628 --> 08:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
does in our research we looked at uh RSA
 
08:09:55.548 --> 08:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
162b which is our atomic energy statutes
 
08:09:57.468 --> 08:09:57.478 align:start position:0%
this bill updates those statutes and it
 
08:09:58.830 --> 08:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
does three
 
08:10:01.510 --> 08:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
things it updates some of the the
 
08:10:03.670 --> 08:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
obsolete terms that are in that statute
 
08:10:05.990 --> 08:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
for instance the NRC is not in the
 
08:10:09.468 --> 08:10:09.478 align:start position:0%
statute with this bill the the old the
 
08:10:11.510 --> 08:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
old term will be updated to
 
08:10:15.110 --> 08:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
NRC it puts it ties our statutes to the
 
08:10:16.948 --> 08:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
federal definition
 
08:10:18.590 --> 08:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
of advanced nuclear this is one of the
 
08:10:20.030 --> 08:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations we heard on the
 
08:10:22.548 --> 08:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
commission so the definition of advanced
 
08:10:25.308 --> 08:10:25.318 align:start position:0%
nuclear will be in our statutes and the
 
08:10:28.270 --> 08:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
third thing it does there's an obsolete
 
08:10:30.750 --> 08:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
position that's been in our statutes for
 
08:10:33.070 --> 08:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
decades it's been ignored for at least a
 
08:10:35.868 --> 08:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
decade that there's a coordinator of
 
08:10:38.150 --> 08:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
atomic energy uh
 
08:10:40.510 --> 08:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
studies so every two years this
 
08:10:42.788 --> 08:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
coordinator was supposed to work with
 
08:10:45.910 --> 08:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
various state agencies deliver a report
 
08:10:48.230 --> 08:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
on the atomic energy industry to the
 
08:10:50.750 --> 08:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
governor and the general counsel that's
 
08:10:53.830 --> 08:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
current statute and it's been ignored so
 
08:10:55.670 --> 08:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it proposes to
 
08:10:58.628 --> 08:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
resurrect that position put it under the
 
08:11:00.308 --> 08:11:00.318 align:start position:0%
the newly the since created Department
 
08:11:05.788 --> 08:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:08.190 --> 08:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and so it's a refresh
 
08:11:10.230 --> 08:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
of current statute and the idea is that
 
08:11:12.868 --> 08:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
our state government would pay attention
 
08:11:15.350 --> 08:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the progress of advanced nuclear
 
08:11:17.190 --> 08:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
which could should be coming to
 
08:11:20.430 --> 08:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
commercialization the next 5 to 10 years
 
08:11:22.788 --> 08:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
so it continues this the study process
 
08:11:24.548 --> 08:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
the department of energy was involved
 
08:11:27.830 --> 08:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
with an amendment on this bill uh of
 
08:11:29.468 --> 08:11:29.478 align:start position:0%
course they take no position but they
 
08:11:31.350 --> 08:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
they are aware of the amendment and had
 
08:11:34.190 --> 08:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
been working on it in the wisdom of the
 
08:11:36.030 --> 08:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh the committee amendment
 
08:11:38.628 --> 08:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
that we just passed would expand the
 
08:11:41.350 --> 08:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
role of the office of offshore wind
 
08:11:43.868 --> 08:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
development to expand it to include all
 
08:11:46.270 --> 08:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
energy Innovation so not just just wind
 
08:11:49.308 --> 08:11:49.318 align:start position:0%
but also Advanced nuclear solar battery
 
08:11:51.788 --> 08:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
storage hydrogen there's many things
 
08:11:54.388 --> 08:11:54.398 align:start position:0%
that could help our economy improve our
 
08:11:55.948 --> 08:11:55.958 align:start position:0%
electric rates we heard earlier today
 
08:11:57.388 --> 08:11:57.398 align:start position:0%
that we have the highest electric rates
 
08:12:00.070 --> 08:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
in the country so I I think this is a
 
08:12:03.788 --> 08:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
this is planting a seed this bill and uh
 
08:12:06.788 --> 08:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
I urge you to pass it um let me just
 
08:12:10.510 --> 08:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
give you uh a couple of stats there are
 
08:12:13.270 --> 08:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
over 40 companies working in the
 
08:12:16.948 --> 08:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear sector and including a
 
08:12:18.830 --> 08:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
company called Terra power that's owned
 
08:12:21.308 --> 08:12:21.318 align:start position:0%
by Bill Gates out of Wyoming but many
 
08:12:21.318 --> 08:12:22.388 align:start position:0%
by Bill Gates out of Wyoming but many
other

08:12:22.388 --> 08:12:22.398 align:start position:0%
other
 
08:12:24.708 --> 08:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
companies our state can position itself
 
08:12:26.430 --> 08:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
to be in the supply chain for advanced
 
08:12:28.150 --> 08:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear the workforce for advanced
 
08:12:30.468 --> 08:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
nuclear and and the development of
 
08:12:33.548 --> 08:12:33.558 align:start position:0%
companies themselves in Newington New
 
08:12:35.270 --> 08:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you represent Newington we
 
08:12:37.350 --> 08:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
have Westinghouse manufacturing plant
 
08:12:40.070 --> 08:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
they manufacture components of nuclear
 
08:12:42.190 --> 08:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
power plants and right here in

08:13:25.830 --> 08:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
England will not have sufficient natural
 
08:13:27.910 --> 08:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
gas to meet power supply needs for the
 
08:13:30.388 --> 08:13:30.398 align:start position:0%

08:13:33.590 --> 08:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
cold this winter that as we continue to
 
08:13:35.190 --> 08:13:35.200 align:start position:0%

solutions I do believe that and I'd also
 
08:13:45.548 --> 08:13:45.558 align:start position:0%
like to mention that the bill doesn't
 
08:13:48.708 --> 08:13:48.718 align:start position:0%

order thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
08:17:01.030 --> 08:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the long-term
 
08:17:03.350 --> 08:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
accumulation of carbon in the Trees of
 
08:17:06.670 --> 08:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
our forests referred to as carbon
 
08:17:09.350 --> 08:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
sequestration has become a new source of
 
08:17:12.788 --> 08:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
revenue for land owners and
 
08:17:15.388 --> 08:17:15.398 align:start position:0%
investors and if I also know that New
 
08:17:18.070 --> 08:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has no registry in in which to
 
08:17:21.468 --> 08:17:21.478 align:start position:0%

08:17:28.110 --> 08:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
offsets to be sold into existing carbon
 
08:17:30.750 --> 08:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
markets and if I further know that
 
08:17:33.468 --> 08:17:33.478 align:start position:0%
Timber tax revenue is reduced for the
 
08:17:36.270 --> 08:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
abing towns because the amount of Timber
 
08:17:38.868 --> 08:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
harvested off of land that is managed
 
08:17:42.548 --> 08:17:42.558 align:start position:0%
for carbon sequestration is greatly
 
08:17:45.430 --> 08:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
reduced then would I now press the green
 
08:17:47.548 --> 08:17:47.558 align:start position:0%

History Month and this will Mark the end
 
08:25:47.750 --> 08:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
of Black History
 
08:25:51.670 --> 08:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
Month I uh I grew up white in this state
 
08:25:53.910 --> 08:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
to put it plainly I grew up to a single
 
08:25:58.510 --> 08:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
mother in the manad region who had a
 
08:26:00.788 --> 08:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
didn't have a lot of melon in her skin
 
08:26:03.468 --> 08:26:03.478 align:start position:0%
and I didn't uh meet my first black
 
08:26:05.228 --> 08:26:05.238 align:start position:0%
person until I was about maybe five or
 
08:26:07.788 --> 08:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
six years old I didn't understand black
 
08:26:10.468 --> 08:26:10.478 align:start position:0%
history I didn't know the importance of
 
08:26:13.270 --> 08:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
it and sometimes when I was I found
 
08:26:15.788 --> 08:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
myself as a teenager and I'd hear it's
 
08:26:17.270 --> 08:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
Black History Month it's Black History
 
08:26:18.510 --> 08:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
Month well why do we need a Black
 
08:26:20.030 --> 08:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
History Month I'd say to
 
08:26:23.070 --> 08:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
myself but in being here in the
 
08:26:25.788 --> 08:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
legislature it was not truly until last
 
08:26:29.548 --> 08:26:29.558 align:start position:0%
year when I met representative Linda
 
08:26:29.558 --> 08:26:30.510 align:start position:0%
year when I met representative Linda
Harriet

08:26:30.510 --> 08:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
Harriet
 
08:26:33.430 --> 08:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
goth uh that I truly understood the
 
08:26:35.910 --> 08:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
importance of this month that I
 
08:26:38.468 --> 08:26:38.478 align:start position:0%
understood what being black was
 
08:26:40.948 --> 08:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
especially here in this legislature when
 
08:26:43.548 --> 08:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
I can look out and see representative D
 
08:26:46.510 --> 08:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo and representative Judy when I
 
08:26:48.990 --> 08:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
get to meet representative Harvey key
 
08:26:52.190 --> 08:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
these people who blazed a trail to allow
 
08:26:57.110 --> 08:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
a young idealistic kid from petero with
 
08:27:00.228 --> 08:27:00.238 align:start position:0%
dreadlocks to serve in the legislature I
 
08:27:03.150 --> 08:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
mean that is the importance of Black
 
08:27:04.750 --> 08:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
History Month that's the importance of
 
08:27:07.708 --> 08:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
celebrating the history of a people
 
08:27:09.910 --> 08:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
black history month was originated by a
 
08:27:12.150 --> 08:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
man named Carter J
 
08:27:15.110 --> 08:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
Woodson and he originated it as
 
08:27:17.350 --> 08:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
something called negro history
 
08:27:21.388 --> 08:27:21.398 align:start position:0%
week he created that week to highlight
 
08:27:23.830 --> 08:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
the contributions black people have made
 
08:27:27.750 --> 08:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
to our all of us the American story and
 
08:27:29.830 --> 08:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
he had hoped that so-called Black
 
08:27:32.670 --> 08:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
History Month eventually would no longer
 
08:27:35.788 --> 08:27:35.798 align:start position:0%
be necessary as the two would become
 
08:27:37.868 --> 08:27:37.878 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable as black history would
 
08:27:39.590 --> 08:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
become American history as American
 
08:27:41.750 --> 08:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
history would become black history as we
 
08:27:43.510 --> 08:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think of it as anything other
 
08:27:45.228 --> 08:27:45.238 align:start position:0%
than American
 
08:27:48.788 --> 08:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
history and we stand here
 
08:27:52.388 --> 08:27:52.398 align:start position:0%
today honoring him in his in his vision
 
08:27:54.670 --> 08:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is deeply
 
08:27:57.228 --> 08:27:57.238 align:start position:0%
intertwined with black history our
 
08:28:00.468 --> 08:28:00.478 align:start position:0%
cities and towns abolish slavery as
 
08:28:02.948 --> 08:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
early as
 
08:28:06.228 --> 08:28:06.238 align:start position:0%
1805 that was Portsmith that's right
 
08:28:06.238 --> 08:28:07.228 align:start position:0%
1805 that was Portsmith that's right
that's

08:28:07.228 --> 08:28:07.238 align:start position:0%
that's
 
08:28:11.430 --> 08:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
right our Inseparable history with
 
08:28:15.350 --> 08:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
abolition with black history ranges from
 
08:28:19.030 --> 08:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
as macro as our churches being among the
 
08:28:22.270 --> 08:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
first to call for abolition sparking a
 
08:28:24.670 --> 08:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
movement of change in this country that
 
08:28:27.830 --> 08:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
would end Catt slavery as we know it and
 
08:28:30.948 --> 08:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
free so many people in this country From
 
08:28:35.270 --> 08:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
Slavery to as micro as Oda let me get
 
08:28:37.830 --> 08:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
her name right let me get her name right
 
08:28:42.270 --> 08:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
as Oda a slave of George Washington's
 
08:28:45.070 --> 08:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
who escaped here to Smith and her house
 
08:28:46.788 --> 08:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
still stands there today if you get a
 
08:28:48.948 --> 08:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
chance I definitely recommend going to
 
08:28:51.388 --> 08:28:51.398 align:start position:0%
check it out and she stood here and
 
08:28:53.110 --> 08:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
lived a peaceful life here in New
 
08:28:55.510 --> 08:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as the president sent his
 
08:28:58.430 --> 08:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
goons out to try and find her black
 
08:29:01.308 --> 08:29:01.318 align:start position:0%
history history of a people history of
 
08:29:05.750 --> 08:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
abolition runs so deep in this state
 
08:29:09.030 --> 08:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
and I cannot do the history of our state
 
08:29:11.270 --> 08:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
and its connection to civil rights and
 
08:29:12.910 --> 08:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
the abolition movements here on the
 
08:29:14.948 --> 08:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
floor any justice
 
08:29:18.308 --> 08:29:18.318 align:start position:0%
but what I can do is honor those members
 
08:29:20.430 --> 08:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
