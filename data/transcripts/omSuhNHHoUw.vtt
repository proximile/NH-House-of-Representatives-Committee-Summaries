thank you for having us I'm Bill Cass

the commissioner from New Hampshire dot
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
with me is Danielle Shandra she's our
 
00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
director of uh Finance uh there are
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
several other folks that if they get
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
called on to help answer the questions
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
we can um we can bring up and and
 
00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
introduce at the time so but I have uh
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
several staff here that so we should be
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
able to walk you through the budget and
 
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
ask and answer any questions that that
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
that you might have so so I guess in
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
terms of process it looks have a nice
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
slide deck which we can open open up
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
with I assume that's your plan but we
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
would like to go through the actual
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
budget Page by Page yes okay right I
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be I mean I I'll be very brief
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
from the presentation just it's very
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
high level hopefully it I yeah we we
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
tried to organize it to make it a a
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
higher level summary but uh I'd just
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
like to step through that very quickly
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
and if that's fine and then we have
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
plenty of time I think hopefully we'll
 
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 align:start position:0%
all survive the time and I know I know
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
at our an introductory um uh meeting an
 
00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 align:start position:0%
overview the were a number of questions
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
I know we provided through Mickey uh a a
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
lot of information to answer those
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
questions and if there are any questions
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
on any of that material we can answer
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
those questions as well too and along
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
those lines do you mind being
 
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
interrupted while you're presenting or
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
not at all no okay so feel free to let
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
me know that you you have any questions
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
while he's going for okay yours and I'll
 
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
try to be clear and and uh you know
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes I know I do laps maybe into
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
acronyms or things like that so please
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
if something we say isn't clear
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
definitely uh uh ask I'll try to be
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
clear so I can start with our uh step
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
through the presentation I also wanted
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
to point out um traditionally we have
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
provided a uh a a budget book which um
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know kind of summarizes in pictures
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
our our budget and the organizational
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
structure and and a little more detail
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
on each of the um Aus each of the
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
organizational units um some pictures
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
and the accomplishments of what they use
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
this forms the basis of our annual
 
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
report but we found it a a helpful
 
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
internal reference and if you want a
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more information about what
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
bridge maintenance or project
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
development or any one of the orgs that
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's a little less sterile than the
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
than the than the budget summary so
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's uh hopefully that that helps but
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
we won't go through that that is there
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a reference if you find it
 
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
helpful Does it include count numbers so
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
I can tie it to the it does yes yep it's
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
organized in the same uh the same stru
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
structure by the uh uh Aus and the
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
organal organizational units yes great
 
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.430 align:start position:0%
organal organizational units yes great

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
you so um I will step through our uh
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
budget presentation very very quickly
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
the first page was our mission and and
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
purpose the second page was our
 
00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
organizational structure just a
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
a650 uh Personnel organization divided
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
into uh five Ma divisions each division
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
overseen by a director and the summary
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
of The divisions and and the uh uh
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
bureaus underneath those divisions are
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
on that organizational chart um the next
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
Slide the next two slides just give a
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
very top level funding summary of our of
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
our overall budget and the type of
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
funding that that goes in there so our
 
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.070 align:start position:0%
funding that that goes in there so our
FY

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
FY
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
2026 Governor's recommended budget total
 
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
for the agency is 79 $95.99 million it's
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
virtually the same as our FY 25 adjusted
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
authorized um and the percentage
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
breakdown of of the of the funding is is
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
is shown there primarily funded by uh
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds Highway funds um other
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
funds bulk of our funding is is
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
federally funded in our construction
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
programs and things like that and that
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
little blue that little green insert is
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
the very thin slice of of uh General
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
funds that support our um
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
non-highway uh organizational
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
units um on the next page the pie charts
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
there just kind of show a little bit of
 
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
how we tend to break up our our our
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
budget into two major components uh
 
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal Aid and construction on on the
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
left it's about 54 55% of our budget um
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is our construction
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
program and just as a refresher a lot of
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
the decisions about those Investments
 
00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:04.839 align:start position:0%
and and how uh the program is developed
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
is uh taken up in the off budget year
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
when we developed the state's 10-year um
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
um transportation Improvement program um
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
the operating budget which is the uh
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
Browner half of of that pie chart really
 
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
represents our operational budget uh
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
primarily uh I think the focus of of of
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
division 2 in this uh this budget
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
process um and that's about 46% of our
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
overall budget all the funding and and
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
stuff here is shown there but but like I
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
said most of the discretionary most of
 
00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
the budgetary stuff that we talk about
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
with our operating budget is contained
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
in that half of the pie and some of the
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
percentages um we didn't break them down
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
but the majority of of the municipal Aid
 
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.829 align:start position:0%
but the majority of of the municipal Aid
and

00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
construction uh funding that comes from
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
the federal federal program our Federal
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
Highway program FTA for the transit FAA
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
for the Aeronautics you know all of
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
those programs that flow through on the
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
operating side the the the primary
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
funding source for our operational needs
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
is the state highway fund so uh very
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
just brief reminder there perh on Murray
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry to stop so early but I
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
was just um Turnpike funds are for
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
turnpikes correct okay so I was just
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
confused when it's you have it under
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
unrestricted funds but technically isn't
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
a a restricted fund because it is only
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
can be used in turnpikes as opposed to
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
you know moving it over to something
 
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
else and isn't that also the case with
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
the highway funds restricted for use but
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
they're still considered unrestricted
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
from the state perspective okay thank
 
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.150 align:start position:0%
from the state perspective okay thank
you

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it's an Enterprise fund but it's
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
not a restricted fund is that a good way
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
to say it I mean it's self-funded within
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system it can only be used
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
for the turnpike system and and that's
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
tied to the RSA um the highway tied to
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution but from a Statewide
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
Financial perspective they they're
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
looked at as unrestricted funds
 
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
okay um if you turn the page um we don't
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
have page numbers I apologize but uh
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
that just gives a a a sense of our
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
positions and the trends um we have been
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
very level in terms of number of full
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
budgeted full-time positions since uh
 
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
2014 we've maintained uh uh that uh
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
level of Staffing but uh the red line
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
there represents vehicle miles traveled
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
or or use of the transportation system
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
um and and that has increased so um the
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
bottom part of that chart also shows you
 
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
know some of the recent Trends uh that
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing with a ever
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
increasing uh vacancy rate um and I I
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
like to point out that this this in my
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
mind demonstrates that I think do is an
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
efficient a agency we uh continue to
 
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
perform and continue to do more with
 
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.069 align:start position:0%
perform and continue to do more with
less

00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
so the the next um how are those the
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
vacant positions are they funded or
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
unfunded they are funded okay thank you
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
in an Ideal World they would we would we
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
would we would fill those positions you
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
know we believe that's a staffing level
 
00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:28.519 align:start position:0%
we we need to um deliver the services uh
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
to the level of uh to the levels that
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
people would expect um again I think
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
further on in the budget I I talk about
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting done what we what we have
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
to have to get done as we continually
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
prioritize um but maybe not all that we
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
should be doing or would like to be
 
00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.269 align:start position:0%
should be doing or would like to be
doing

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.350 align:start position:0%
doing
so

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
um the next the next slide uh just kind
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
of summarizes um some of the Aus in
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
there but it really highlights the uh
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
the budget targets that we were given to
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
meet our general fund budget Target was
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
$1.88 million Turnpike fund was
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
$458 Million which represents about a
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know a flat um a flat Revenue
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
Outlook in the highway fund was about
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
$250 million again a flat level
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
projection to meet these um to meet
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
these budget targets the you know one of
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
the things we had done and I've got a
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
very brief summary of where they
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
happened we unfunded seven permanent
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
positions and nine temporary full-time
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
positions uh as part of the effort to
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
meet these uh budget targets uh and
 
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
there are a few areas that we can
 
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
highlight as we get into the budget
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
where we feel we're purposely
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
underfunding uh some efforts uh and we
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
did that in order to meet the budget
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
targets is that noted on here on the
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
slide it's it's uh uh I it's it's it's
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
not it's not highlighted there uh it's
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
summarized in the next several slid so
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
I'm just rolling up from the next
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
several slides but it ALS there I'll a
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
place where notes that they're actually
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
s unfunded positions yes okay thank you
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
so if you turn the page um where we talk
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
about Aeronautics Rail and Transit um
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
very that very top box of of um how we
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
met those budget targets so that's the
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's the one area that is um generally
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
funded in the department um so uh in
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
order to meet that uh budget Target of
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
about it was on the previous page our
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
general fund budget Target was about
 
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.430 align:start position:0%
general fund budget Target was about
$1.8

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
$1.8
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
million um previous budgets had funded
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh State Transit operating match at
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
around $1.8 million per year uh of
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
General funds that was a special um
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation for that
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
match in the last budget um in order to
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
meet the budget targets we weren't able
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
to fund that this year uh in this budget
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
about $200,000 of
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
reallocated uh
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
drone handles uh drones what does uas
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
stand for unmanned unmanned aerial
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
system I apologize um uh and uh shifted
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
that position from Bureau of Aeronautics
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
to be funded with Highway funds so a
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
couple questions here sure can you just
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
for me being new to this what is the
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
state Transit operating match yes so um
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
we provide the the the through through
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
the department we provide FTA funds for
 
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh FTA is Federal Transit Authority for
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
local um and Community Transit uh
 
00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:07.069 align:start position:0%
local um and Community Transit uh
operations

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
um typically those federal funds require
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
a a match um most of the operating most
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
of the operating um federal funds
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
require about a 50% match historically
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
um the state has provided very little
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
assistance to the local Transit agencies
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
in in coming up with and and meeting
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
that match in the last budget cycle with
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
increasing um federal funds there was a
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
um willingness from the from the
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
legislature to provide some uh
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
additional support for local um Transit
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
operators in um Meeting those match
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
requirements to the tune of about $1.8
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
million a
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
year so by reducing that you also lost
 
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
some federal funds that you would have
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
matched with it or that remains to be
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
seen there is it the there is there is
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
the potential there is I guess the
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
potential that uh some Federal Transit
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
funds may not be able to be utilized for
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
for lack of match um that uh again that
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen uh whether whether
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
local communities uh whether the local
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
Transit agencies can can find find or
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
come up with that match um the one
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
interesting thing with Federal it funds
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
is the utilization of those funds extend
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
over a number of a number of years so
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the implications of of
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
um of potential loss of FTA funds may
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
not be realized for for several years
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
down the
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
road and regarding the alternately
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
altern the way refunded the uas position
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
with the highway fund so as opposed to
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
what how had it been funded it had been
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
previously funded as part of the
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
operating uh uh costs for the Bureau of
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics with General funds a big
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
part of that position we feel good job
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
it it well thank you it's a uh a bit one
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that allows us to do that
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
is those positions support uh a lot of
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
the project development activities some
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
of the survey some of the uh supporting
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
um mapping and so forth for um Federal
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
federally funded projects um so it'll so
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
a there was a Nexus there was a
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh accommodation to make is
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
that a fa way to State it it is and uh
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
it will be restricted by the
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution so so that us uas Position
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
will need to only work on Highway
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
related work it will not be able to work
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
on other it can't work on Turnpike work
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
and it cannot work on any general funded
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh work as well so at a high level could
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
you explain to me how
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
Highway fund is sort of as I understand
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
it comes in through safety and they gets
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
split into I guess mostly transportation
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
and safety MH do they control it do you
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
control it how does that work you
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
control it the legis I
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
totally maybe I should rephrase my
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
question how have we set it up to be
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
controlled so for instance if I was
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
going to do things that would increase
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
the revenue flowing into the highway
 
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919 align:start position:0%
fund how would I direct that to you if I
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to to your to the transportation
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
if I want
 
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:36.990 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:48.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
you there are some statutory you know
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines as far as uh limiting the uh
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation to uh safety or or other
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
things and but I know in the past the
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
legislature has has waved some of those
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
um restrictions Mr but I would say okay
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
Mr land again just to remind everyone
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
how it works so unrestricted Highway
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
funds which mainly the road toll lot of
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle fees goes into the Highway
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
F we have the Surplus statement that we
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
walk uh the committee through all of
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
those Appropriations are made by Finance
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
by the house bill House Bill one
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes House Bill two so there is no
 
00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:30.919 align:start position:0%
mechanism for Department to access those
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
on their own so to speak so safety
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't pull or whatever it's all
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the budget uh both
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
departments do have a mechanism to draw
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
from Surplus with fiscal committee and
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
GNC approval but all the Appropriations
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
are made through the operating budget
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
process so clearly must have some idea
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
of what that appropriation is because
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
they've made this switch from General
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
funds to Highway funds knowing that they
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
had the highway funds available to do
 
00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:53.870 align:start position:0%
had the highway funds available to do
this

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
position and that is the Surplus
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
statement as a balancing document to
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
know what is available for Highway fund
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
so when the governor's office put
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
together its budget uh it would have
 
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
looked at and I'm speaking at attorney
 
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
or somewh they would have looked at that
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's available Highway funds to fund
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
this or maybe there weren't General
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
funds to do so
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay and this that that that switch of
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
the position here was our own internal
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
balancing of the Department's budget and
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
the Department's funding streams
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
so represent of wer chairman wer what's
 
00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
the main use of the unmanned aerial
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
system system how many hours a year
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
would you say it gets used how many
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
different drones are there we have two
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
full-time positions that that support it
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
um I can have Andre our Deputy
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioner give you more more details
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
but primarily uh it's it's used to
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
support uh Department activities uh
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
mapping surveillance not surveillance
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
but but survey I should say survey
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
um survey I mean when we have uh you
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
know projects there's there's uh uh you
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
know a lot of mapping and things that
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
that that go on to develop the plans and
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
stuff um and uh utilizing the um the
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
drones and and stuff support support
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
that it also is utilized um when we had
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh storms last summer for emergency um
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
assessment of damage and stuff there
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
were areas um in the North Country uh
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
last July June July when there were big
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
storms um along some of the railroad
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
corridors where we couldn't get access
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
and using the uh the drones helped us
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
assemble that information provide um
 
00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:41.559 align:start position:0%
estimates to FEMA for reimbursement and
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
things like that the first time hearing
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
of it how long have you been using these
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh so we're about at the a little over
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
the fiveyear point uh and Andre Brier
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner thank you and uh I
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
do remember uh representative wer um
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
talking to you this was probably coming
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
on two years ago maybe a year and a half
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
ago talking to you about uh how we were
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
utilizing a uh a deployment study that
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
that was funded by the legislature gave
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity to kind of rethink and
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
organize the uas um Enterprise moving
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
forward and um we did so I'm I'm happy
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
to report that we are able to hold the
 
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.070 align:start position:0%
to report that we are able to hold the
first

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh uas community of Interest
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
meeting um we convened that over at dot
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
last month so all agencies and state
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
government that operate uas uh are
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
coming together now once a quarter to
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
talk about best acquisition practices
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
efficiencies if we can um achieve
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
economies of scale by doing Mass
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
purchases um and really coordinating how
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
we use it there's two broad Mission sets
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
um one being law enforcement the other
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
being what we do which is really survey
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
and um aiding construction aiding uh
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
natural disaster recovery so we are
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
really progressing as a state when it
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
comes to efficiently using these
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
platforms we've got all kinds of neat
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
things that are going to enable us to
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
more real time monitor the quality of
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
construction that's happening on our
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
roads um we have some great uh some
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
great video that I'd be happy to show
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
any member that shows really some
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
amazing things that we can get value to
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
the state using these we can see real
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
time when a uh when a Paving um contract
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
is happening and they're doing an
 
00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
incorrect seam where in the past we it
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
may have taken a year to discover poor
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
construction now we can see it real time
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
using infrared we can estimate amounts
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
quantities of construction material so
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
we know that we're not getting chiseled
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
you know real time so it's that type of
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
thing but it's incredibly useful you
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
just have do you have one or two or we
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
have we have uh I think it's around five
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
now yeah and and uh ranging from large
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
to small the real Innovation moving
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
forward is purchasing more uh small uas
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
that can be uh deployed by construction
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
teams in the field size are these 20 ft
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
long 10 ft long um they range from you
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
know dinner plate uh all the way to
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
something you know that's wingspan is
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
about the size of this table when you're
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
talking uh heavier platforms liar um
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
where we can see through trees
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
and things like that so a lot cheaper
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
than an airplane a lot cheaper a lot
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper to run and a lot more efficient
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
and there's really uh Innovative and
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
interesting laws that are going to come
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the books from the feds in the coming
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
years which are going to allow things
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
like Beyond line of sight use where you
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
could launch it from do headquarters go
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
20 miles away do do a do a mission and
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
come back without the operator having to
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
go you can sit there in the headquarters
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
real time and say okay look what's
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
happening rather than wait for somebody
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
to give you a report much more efficient
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh that way Del yes sir we once had a
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
chairman of this committee that was
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
anti drones because he thought they were
 
00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
just going to go around peeking in
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
people's windows right which and we got
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
we have to guard against that but like
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
I've said in various Forum uh for we
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
don't look at people we look at roads so
 
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we do with the Department of
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you yes
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
sir uh rep have can Phil up hack can
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
Phil thank you uh thank you so much just
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up question I want to make
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm understanding correctly
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
that there are two U positions and one
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
is that you're um funding that Source
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
differently with Highway funds
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
exclusively so that the other position
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
is still a general funded position and
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
that they can carry on that scope of
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
scope of work I assume that you're still
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
covering both your bases but you're just
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
um reallocating funding and their scope
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
of I guess work that's correct that's
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
correct yep and as a follow-up question
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
um what is the impact of um the split
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
what are you unable or no longer able to
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
do with the second position if or is
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
everything still covered and should be
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
copacetic I would say everything is
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
covered and copacetic it said it creates
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit more administrative uh uh
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh burden because of uh the fact that
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
that it is uh you know to fund that
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
position it has to be restricted to only
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
working on federal aid eligible uh
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
projects and activities but um when we
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
looked at the uh the workload and the
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
amount of uh you know support that that
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
position that those activities provide
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
it was a it was a reasonable um it was a
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable um switch to make and it is
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
important to note that those uh the way
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're structured we knew we couldn't add
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
any more positions so those aren't are
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
only uh drone operators we're also our
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
plan moving forward and we're currently
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
implementing it is to cross Trin
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
existing dot employees to operate drones
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
as well get them their licenses that way
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
we can draw on a a larger expert pool
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
without adding positions moving forward
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's been our strategy and there's
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
more than enough Highway work we're NE
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
none of these people none of these
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
positions no matter how they're funded
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
are ever uh short of work so we have a
 
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
very long uh cue for um for drone work
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
moving ahead and this seems to
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
work you want to proceed so um the next
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
if we if we if they flip the page over
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh we just kind of summarize uh uh the
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
policy and
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
administration um uh division uh
 
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
again Finance did I Mis Finance I'm
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
sorry oh Finance is at the bottom so
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
don't flip the page over right below
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics Rail and Transit is the
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
division of of of Finance thank you
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
because there were some changes there we
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
needed to make so in order to meet
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
budget targets and and
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
um uh address the budget there we
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
reduced uh we eliminated two full-time
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
positions there um there was some
 
00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
reduction in the print shop equipment
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
purchases um and we had some deeper Cuts
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
in FY 27 overtime temporary help in
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
equipment and supplies in order to meet
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
targets um so when you had asked uh
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
represent the ver about the you know so
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
I've summarized the my my initial
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
statement I kind of rolled those all up
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
Department wide but these are where the
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
um you know position eliminations were
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
were made to uh to meet budget targets
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
you hav know what account that
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
is this particular account 301 31 yes
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
and when we get to going through the the
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
um the org by org we we can highlight
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
those as well too yeah thank you and um
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
now turning the page to policy and
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
administration uh again that was an an
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
area where to meet budget targets we
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
eliminated a temporary full-time
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
position reduced budget budgeted
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
overtime and temporary help to meet
 
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
budget targets um there are some
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
implications with with that as uh as as
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
we move forward that we'll have to
 
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
manage on the uh the bottom of that uh
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
on on the next page there talking about
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
the the vision of project development
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
which includes um also the municipal Aid
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
and our federal aid program uh to meet
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
budget targets there um we reduced uh
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
had a reduction of 12 positions and and
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
I should point out um in the bottom
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
right corner of each one of these is the
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
is the total number of of uh permanent
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
positions in that division so you get a
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
sense of you know how many you know
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
where the reductions are and what the
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
impacts are so in uh project development
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
we had a reduction of 12 positions three
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
permanent full-time positions nine
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time positions um out of
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
uh that division has about 374 total
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
permanent positions so so going
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
backwards you actually added positions
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the previous no we're actually
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
reclassing uh positions they were in a
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
in the wrong division so in the in the
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
turnpike division you'll see a change
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
when we go through that could you just
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
tie the two together so I can make note
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
of that y
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
um the other the other change in the
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
budget you see some numbers when we go
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
go through it we we did realign the
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
safety section um to make them uh to
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
elevate that safety section and make it
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
a direct report to the commissioner's
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
office in ter in terms of um so there
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
were eight positions that were within
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
that safety section that that had moved
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
out from project development under under
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
um under the commissioner's office so
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
you'll see that that that change but
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
it's just a swap from one One Division
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
um um the next page after that we do had
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
I think we had covered this the last
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
time was just some of those um facts and
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
figures about the uh about the highway
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
fund uh and uh how particularly in the
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
middle of that you know we had some
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
questions earlier about the split of of
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
how Highway fund Revenue has been
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
appropriated so in FY 24 I think % ver
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
to your question 57% of the uh Highway
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
fund Revenue was appropriated to dot
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
about 30% to other agencies primarily
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
the department of safety but there are
 
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
some other agencies that get one or 2%
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
and about 133% of the highway fund
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue appropriated to
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and who is it that I mean
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
I know it's us that controls this but
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
who is it that collects for instance
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
registration fees and that sort of thing
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's the department of safety
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
department of safety yeah they can they
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
the DMV collects the registration fees
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
and the um the road toll Bureau collects
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
the gas tax so they'd be the one best
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
suited to make recommendations and that
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and how how like how long
 
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
ago they were raised and so on so forth
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you certainly the
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
interesting thing is that the uh court
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
has been a dollar amount forever $2
 
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
million a year I'm surprised they
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
haven't come and said oh we need to
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
inflate that with inflation huh yeah
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's the same 2 million for as long as
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
we remember right yeah yeah yeah 30
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
years or so yeah I don't know if it's
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
been scrutinized or looked at closely
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
recently but and the Lilac
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
fund we have that in in we have that in
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
the in the details so um but but again
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom of that talks about the
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
revenue is flat and incrementally
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
declining in in the long term um the
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of one-time
 
00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
fixes to the highway fund general fund
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
infusions over the years years in order
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
to uh address shortages and and balance
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
the highway
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
fund um the next page just summarizes
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the division of operations which
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
is by far and uh by by large our our
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
largest uh
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
division uh total personnel there of
 
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
division uh total personnel there of
about

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
1150 um full-time permanent positions to
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh meet budget targets there uh this is
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
where we had uh eliminated or or
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded three permanent full-time
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
positions two temporary full-time
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
positions and we also I again I had
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
alluded to that we were underfunding
 
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
purposely underfunding some areas in
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
order to meet budget targets
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
historically we have uh underfunded uh
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance uh we tend to try to
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
m m we tend to try to budget for a
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
three-year average um every every year
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
can be higher or or lower um through
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
discussions with with with the with the
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
legislature it has been um viewed as as
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
as you know purposefully underfunding or
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
or funding very optimistically and and
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
if if it is a uh more um severe winter
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
to go back to uh fiscal committee um
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
with the exact numbers so that has been
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we've done a couple of times
 
00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:22.839 align:start position:0%
this year to date but and how's it
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
looking this year in terms of the rest
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
of the year as far as we have uh fiscal
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
will be seeing next month another
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
another uh transfer to support um the
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
activities that have uh happened through
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
February and through the end of the year
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
so to date we've transferred uh in in
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
this fy2 425 budget about well FY 25
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
budget it's a close to $10 million that
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
that we've had to uh transfer into
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance to cover winter costs
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
and if you include if you include the uh
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
retention incentive they would bring it
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
up to about 12 and a half 13 what is it
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
that you're including there the
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
retention incentive for staff the $5,000
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
y so we can get into more detail when we
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
get to the budget there but th those are
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
the um the the real the real highlights
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
um the next the next page just
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
summarizes the the turnpike Fund in the
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
turnpike system I think representative
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
Murray you had had asked about the
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
turnpike fund again that is
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
um 89 miles of of freeway that are uh
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
solely supported by the by the um by the
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
tolls not the road toll but the actual
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
toll plazas on on those on those
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
facilities and um um you know that fund
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
is um again not restricted funds but the
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
but the funding on the turnike system is
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
is is is is restricted to just take care
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the turnpike system um and the
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
revenue projections are are there um the
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
very last page is uh before we get into
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
the the detailed uh sheet by sheet uh
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
budget review um just some I just wanted
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
to highlight uh some of the additional
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
needs and uh we we hit on them but um
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
the top of that page uh you know really
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
kind of summarizes what we had
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
identified for ident additional needs
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
that weren't funded in the governor's
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
budget we've prioritized them there um
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
Danielle had just mentioned the
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
retention incentive program for the last
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
three years um in order to uh combat
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies and to meet um you know winter
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance um needs we've had a uh uh
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
about a 2.83 $3 million what's that
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
three and A5 million um uh winter um
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
incentive bonus retention incentive
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
bonus um and that has has
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
um you know brought you know volunteers
 
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
to uh people that work for the dot and
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
other areas that have uh CDL licenses
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
that can plow um by offering that that
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
um that that incentive bonus they
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer to to plow and uh it it makes
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
up this year it made up about half of
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
the vacancies and allowed us to be
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
successful through through the through
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
through the winter so um
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
again from one of our priority needs we
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
that uh vacancy issue being meaningfully
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
changed in the foreseeable future and in
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
order to continue to keep up with winter
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs we see the need to
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
continue this this this program um and
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
that would be our highest uh additional
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
need to look to fund or include in the
 
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
budget more so than deferred maintenance
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
more so than deferred maintenance yeah
 
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.150 align:start position:0%
more so than deferred maintenance yeah
yeah

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're both they're both High needs but
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
we can't do what we do without without
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
people um to uh man those trucks
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
so um the equipment replacement program
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
um again to maintain Fleet efficiency
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
that's an area that uh you know based on
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
statistics and the age of the fleet and
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
so forth we should be investing about $1
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
million a year to
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
um you know to keep up with with the
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the with the fleet um keep it in
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
good working order um last budget um at
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
the end of the budget in hb2 there was a
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
$4.8 million additional um need to uh to
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
meet those um equipment replacement
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
needs that was funded with the general
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
fund at the end of it so it wasn't
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
reflected in our base budget um and as
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
we uh again tried to meet budget targets
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
that was an area that again is
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
underfunded from the foreseeable need
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
that that that we have um and the was it
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
funded at the 11 million or is this
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
funded something lower than that the
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
currently in your current budget
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
currently it's budgeted about half of
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
about half of that half of the 11
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
million yes right thank
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
you and then I I had uh mentioned we had
 
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
talked recently we had just talked about
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance as well too where
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
we're purposefully underfunding that
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
from what we would typically budget for
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
three a average
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
so um and lastly if if we have time if
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
we get to it I there are a couple of
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
things um for uh for hb2 that we that
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to talk to the um
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee about as well too um we need
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
to budget some additional restricted
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
Transit revenues this deals with a
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
recently um a a a recently executed
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
contract with a a public private
 
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.630 align:start position:0%
contract with a a public private
partnership

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
um that um that we have a long-term
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
lease for someone to operate the uh
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Dover Transit centers and
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh per the contract some of the revenue
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
that comes in for that needs to be
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
restricted for that use um we didn't
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily realize that or set that up
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
when we were uh developing the budget
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
back uh last at the end of last summer
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and so there's Revenue to address
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
with that as well as the restricted
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
so so that's a very high level o
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
overview it took me longer than I think
 
00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:38.559 align:start position:0%
I told you five minutes but we got more
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
question you're fine that was very good
 
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.750 align:start position:0%
question you're fine that was very good
so

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and then I you know however you
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
want to proceed if you want us to to
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
just hit Page by Page or if you want to
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
yeah go Page by Page and when you come
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
to things that are just mostly federally
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
funded you can maybe just point that out
 
00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
and probably move past those more
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
rapidly I would imagine
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay you want to lead or you want me to
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
represent Murr yeah thank you because we
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
usually don't look you know a lot of the
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that's outside our
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
purview but in uh I think there are
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
instances can you point out if there's
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
um concern about losing some federal
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
funds and if that loss of the funds will
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
impact uh what we have to do or will
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
impact your ability to do your job so if
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
there's you know that kind of a concern
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
that spills
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
out of the federal into some State
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
concerns so thank
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
you I start I guess sure all right so
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
the first so so the budget starts on
 
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.750 align:start position:0%
the first so so the budget starts on
page

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
774 for you and it starts with the
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
division of Aeronautics Rail and Transit
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
funds the accounting unit is 2021 it's
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
Federal local projects it's used for
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects funded by um the
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
airport and this is 100% uh Federal
 
00:43:55.559 --> 00:43:57.630 align:start position:0%
airport and this is 100% uh Federal
funded

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
and one of the little odd balls about
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
about this is the the majority of the
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds for Aeronautics for for uh
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
for airports the uh FAA funds um have
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
historically gone through the capital
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
budget so uh
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
hb25 um will be another area to discuss
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
um um Aeronautics funding at least for
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
the FAA programs and the airport um
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
Improvement programs
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
yes um two 29 um Airway toll
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
fund um this is for um airport
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and maintenance projects
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
funded by um an aviation fuel fee that's
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
collected by the department of
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
safety um it complies with FAA uh
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
requirements requiring a DED a dedicated
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
fund um in FY 23 25 airports are
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive these funds which
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
provides support for planning rehab
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
development equipment safety security
 
00:44:58.559 --> 00:45:00.349 align:start position:0%
development equipment safety security
and

00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:00.359 --> 00:45:02.230 align:start position:0%
and
mitigation

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
um and the majority all of this is
 
00:45:04.839 --> 00:45:09.390 align:start position:0%
um and the majority all of this is
agency

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
income it is
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
the uh Airway toll fund it's also called
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's the airway toll fund um and it
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
facilities and the majority of this is
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
um federal funds there's a a little bit
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
of money associated with Surplus sales
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
that would be the agency income there
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
and some miscellaneous reimbursements
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
from insurance but the majority of this
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
is federal
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
funds right and the majority of this
 
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.030 align:start position:0%
funds right and the majority of this
Murray

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
no I the majority of this the state
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
services and Facilities deals with the
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
Boston express service that that the
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
department runs and the um the park and
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
ride facilities or or the bus terminal
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
facilities um that that the department
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
owns and
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
maintains this isn't the the SE coast
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
and the nashille and the other one
 
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's I have a question about that when
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
we get to that part of it sure right no
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
but that's why it's separated out
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
because this is par particularly the
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
Facilities represent
 
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
could you explain I'm newbie can you
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
explain to me your your private
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
partnership uh public private
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
partnership with those two organizations
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
that um I assume you're talking about
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
the one that's in Dober and then there's
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
the Boston Express yes well um Boston
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
Express is a service that that that the
 
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:50.559 align:start position:0%
state runs we have a uh um a contract
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
with a with an entity that operates the
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
service on behalf of of the state but
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's a state it's a state-run service
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
um on the facilities over in the Sea
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
Coast on Portsmouth Park and Ride
 
00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:04.839 align:start position:0%
facility and the Dover Park and Ride
 
00:47:09.069 --> 00:47:09.079 align:start position:0%
facility we had just recently um uh done
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
a P3 public private partnership um uh
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
RFP to solicit a um a a a vendor to um
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
on a longterm 35-year lease to uh run
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
and operate those facilities uh for us
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
and take us take the Department of
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation take the state out of the
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
day-to-day uh maintenance and operation
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
of of those
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
facilities and that that was um um C&amp;J
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
CJ it was the successful um proponent of
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
that and they are currently um operating
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
those facilities they recently is part
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
of their business model had you probably
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
seen if you're from over there the um
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
the um uh small fee for parking and the
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
use of those facilities
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
and that oh I'm sorry go ahead go ahead
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
that the the net result of that P3 and
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
the problems we were really going after
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
there were number one the the abuse of
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
those parking facilities especially
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
during peak times where there would be
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know no parking available for
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
families that were trying to take
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
vacation during school breaks um because
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
so many local residents were using it
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
using it as an extension of their
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
driveway and parking wreck vehicles and
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
things like that um so this very small
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee has turned these
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
facilities into net um costs to the
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
department in the state to revenue
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
generators for the for this for the
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
state so we get a a reasonable uh base
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
rent for those facilities from uh the
 
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
vendor uh in addition to six points on
 
00:48:51.069 --> 00:48:51.079 align:start position:0%
Gross parking Revenue it's actually all
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh gross um Revenue uh if so if they
 
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
decide to add a service or or a lunch
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
count or something like that we would
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
get six points off that gross as well um
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
so uh it's going to add uh actually um
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
Jim jalbert uh who runs that company is
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
already uh has improvements on the books
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the facilities themselves uh greater
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
security improved lighting uh and during
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
this last school break uh had good
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
parking availability for all the
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
families that wanted to use that for um
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
leaving the state for vacation can I ask
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
follow just follow up so when that first
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
started out you we own the land the
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
state owned the land that these
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
facilities were bought brought into it's
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
correct it's it's a uh it's a little
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
more complicated just because um part of
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
the parking land at Portsmith is is uh
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
owned by PDA okay um but so it's a
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's a shared facility so the contract
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
for Portsmith itself is is a three-party
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
contract between PDA uh and hdot
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
representing the state and the vendor uh
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
do is is 100% uh run by do by do
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you for sharing that I
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics uh 2107 is Aeronautics that
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
is the accounting unit that does the
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
administration of the Aeronautics
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
program the majority of that is funded
 
00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:34.270 align:start position:0%
program the majority of that is funded
with

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
um General funds so this is the largest
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
um general fund uh ask in here is the
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
aeronomics program it does have some um
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
transfers so when we talked about the
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
transfer of the uas position you can see
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of that here so o4 intra agency
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
transfers is the cost of that uh
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
position and associated costs and then
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
the agency income 09 is the aircraft
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
registration income that we get for that
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
but the majority of this accounting unit
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
is General funded what was that first uh
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
number you gave me class number for the
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
people the class number
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
21 no no I got the account number yes
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's under the estimated sources of
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
funds for Aeronautics class number 004
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
so 004 is is where the position where
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
you're seeing the revenue come in from
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
transfers and okay so that was Zero
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
before where did it come from it comes
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
from the highway side it's the highway
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
position so shows up as agency income
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
because it's an inter agency transfer
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
we'll see another I get that I'm trying
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
to understand in FY 2425 where would I
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
see the numbers
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's not there in well it's obviously
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
not there in this account but you're
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
saying it was somewhere
 
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.069 align:start position:0%
saying it was somewhere
else

00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
no it's in the general f in the general
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
fund it was in that yeah the general
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
fund it's just part of that 1.4 to 1.3
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
million correct at the B correct okay
 
00:52:12.839 --> 00:52:16.750 align:start position:0%
million correct at the B correct okay
thank

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
you up suar thank you very much um can
 
00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
you just some maybe I was trying to type
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
and think at the same time where did why
 
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
did the federal money go away can you
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
just just give a narrative around what
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
happened to the federal money and how
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
this ended up you know with a big chunk
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
of General
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
funds what federal money go away you
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the program I'm talking
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
about um you know we're at 009 page 777
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
um there was a little bit of money
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
before it's just been xed out entirely
 
00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:48.799 align:start position:0%
now um it was a small amount I guess it
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
was mainly all General funds small
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
amount in actual FY 24 yeah
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
okay we can check what that is we can
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
research that's okay than you it's not a
 
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
extraordinary probably some
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
administrative cost or something that we
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
were able to build Federal Highway for
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
or something like or federal government
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
transportation it is primarily funded
 
00:53:25.079 --> 00:53:27.309 align:start position:0%
transportation it is primarily funded
with

00:53:27.309 --> 00:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
massively there's only a small portion
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
of it that is General
 
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
funded because the administrator is
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
split uh 5050 with railroad which is not
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
eligible so a lot of this is the pass
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
through FTA funds that goes to the um
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
um local Transit providers and if um and
 
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
and um again it doesn't it doesn't show
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
here because it was a general fund
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation last year but um typically
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
in that uh class line on the on page
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
779 073 grants for non-federal that is
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
generally the the local the local match
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
um if if there was we mentioned you know
 
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
last bium there was a general funded
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
match of $1.8 million that that helped
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
with the local match for this um the
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
$200,000 that that's shown there is just
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
the um some of the local match that
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
comes in for the bus the bus services
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
fund to right did you say that rail is
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
not included under this that's correct
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
the the only thing that's railing here
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
is there's one administrator that that
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
handles both rail Road and Transit and
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
they're not federally eligible on the
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
rail side so we have to split that cost
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
and so it that's where you see the
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
general funds for that follow up why
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
would that not be federally funded do
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know it wouldn't be federally funded
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
by FTA so so Federal Transit
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
Administration only funds Transit not
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
Railroad and and F doesn't fund that at
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
all so it would but okay thank you
 
00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
and I think to answer your question
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
primarily the railroads in in New
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are not are not um like mass
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
transit railroads they're not like the
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
the TM Boston they're much more freight
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair um apologies for
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
being late I would have been here early
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
even though I misread the schedule but I
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
had to turn around cuz my I left
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
something at home that I shouldn't have
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
I apologize um on line 72 the federal
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
grants um there is some uh you know
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
lumpiness in 2024 2025 it's uh around 9
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
million in 24 and 13.2 in 25 and then it
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
settles to around 12 can you just give
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
me a bit of an idea of why the uh you
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
know roller coaster ride for the lack of
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
a better word I believe and Sh you can
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong I believe that
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
is that reflects the residual uh effects
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
of some of the uh ARA funds or or other
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
Federal um um emergency relief funds
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
that came postco is that is that true
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
Shelley Winters is our director of
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics Rail and Transit good
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
morning uh yes we'll be coming off of
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
the increase from some of the initial
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
arpa and iig funds and we also have some
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
cyclical purchases of replacement
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so there's some spikes based on
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
some Capital procurements that go
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
through this accounting unit and the the
 
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.990 align:start position:0%
through this accounting unit and the the
federal

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
funds thank you so nothing really
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
unexpected just the end of oura and a
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
bit of a you know for the lack of better
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
word seasonal or less than cyclical Rec
 
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
cyclical purchases and we will be
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
settling into that 12 you know million
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
more or less going forward we don't
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
expect corre a lot of variation there
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
correct it's based on the our prognosis
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
of what the formula funds will be sure
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you really appreciate it thank you
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you before you continue I'm just
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure I get in the right
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
place here so looking back at
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
button this is we're going back to the
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
the budget review by division
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics R and Transit that's what
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about that unfunded State
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
Transit is this 217
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
line the what you call it there the uh
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
Grant non-federal
 
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
is that what you were time that to
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
correct correct so actually would be
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
2916 class 73 oh it is the next one over
 
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
okay that was what I was wondering oh
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed your question well no
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
no that's where I had it and then you
 
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
talk then you started talking about
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
arrow and I got okay so BL does belong
 
00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
correct if you have any I need any
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
additional information about the impacts
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
of the L that Transit operating match
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to expound upon that if if
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
desired yeah Mr chair I'd love to hear
 
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
about uh what our regions can expect um
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
for the loss of funding thank you so we'
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
we've reached out and I know we know
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
there's a special session set up Friday
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
where the transit agencies and and their
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
passengers likely will come and speak to
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we've done some early Outreach so
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
with the loss of approximately $1.7
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
million of the general fund match as the
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner said that helps leverage uh
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
a one for one a 50-50 match with FTA
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
funds we can expect that it's going to
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
be a loss of about 3 point $7 million of
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
of funds to help fund Transit so we're
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
expecting that there'll be a loss of
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
service to the residents of the state
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
there'll be some Roots that'll be cut
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
whether that's Saturday service in one
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
Community whether it's night service in
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
another Community whether it's a shop or
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
Shuttle or a demand response service
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
that only goes to a remote Community
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
once or twice a week that may cease Al
 
00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
together whether it's a connecting
 
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
service from Claremont to Lebanon to the
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
to the VA um instead of six trips a day
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
going down to two trips a day those are
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
some of the impacts that the local
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
Transit agencies are currently um
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
scrambling to look into and we'll come
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
to the table Friday with some more um
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
more information on but certainly we
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
expect there to be federal funds left on
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
the table we expect there to be an
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
impact to the traveling public who's
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
using this to get to jobs get to medical
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
appointments get to um nutrition get to
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
recreational so we see there to likely
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
be an impact to quality of life for the
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
residents that are served and in in many
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
cases depend solely on public transit to
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
get them where they need to be again we
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
think the transit agencies will be able
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
to do a a much better job of um
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
articulating those impacts to their
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
local communities but this will affect
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
10 public transit agencies throughout
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
the state uh it may require them to try
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
to liquidate their um Staffing Resources
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
to try to find local funds to supplant
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
this likely they will not be very
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
fruitful in those Endeavors so it will
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
um be a loss of service and probably a
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
loss of of time and resources to to try
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
funds representative M yes thank you um
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
and I know this is near impossible to
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
quantify but I imagine do you think they
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
will have more information um you did a
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
great job of listing the personal impact
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
that that'll have on this and you know
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
and talking about tens of thousands of
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
people I'm imagining um but it would be
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
nice if not impossible to also get the
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
financial impact of what it does to the
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
state for people who can't get to can't
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
get to a job for the sake of this you
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
know the the the income that's lost to
 
01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
them the income that's lost to the
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
community because they've lost their
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
income the cost of the state around
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
Social Services um in terms of being
 
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
able to get to a medical facility for
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
something simple as opposed to waiting
 
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
until because they can't get there until
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
it becomes an emergency room um and
 
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
experience and I know know the New
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Transit Association and the
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
the 10 affected providers are working to
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
do that again some of these things are
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
diff difficult to to quantify and and
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how many missed
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
medical appointments and how many new
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance calls do that result in um how
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
many people may lose their job because
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
of their inability and I so I think they
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
have a better handle currently on the
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
internal impacts there were a system
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
that was trying to be wage competitive
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
with CDL drivers who now figures they
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
will not be able to have that CDL wage
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
increase and then they're now worried
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
about losing drivers to competitive
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
markets and that may also have further
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
service reductions so again I know they
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
have an internal handle and they're
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
trying to coales as a group for Friday
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
to try to bring some um impacts and
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
prognostications without um being too um
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know trying to oversee it or be too
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
outlandish with their inferences but
 
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's their intention on Friday I
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
the next Au is uh 2931 it's railroad
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
that the administration of the railroad
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
program at dot the funding for
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
that is primarily uh General funds and
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
um we also have we do similar to in this
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh accounting unit as we did with the
 
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
uas position in that we share resources
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
and so we share two um FTE with Highway
 
01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:56.349 align:start position:0%
and so we share two um FTE with Highway
design

01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
design
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
I believe they are railroad engineer
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
positions correct one is a railroad
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
engineer position and the other one
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
deals with um mostly railroad as utility
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
as Crossing or um with Crossing um
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
projects that we have or if they're
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
Paving projects that have a railroad
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
interface so there's that Highway um
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
overlap and and kind of cross-section of
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
department and and again this was set up
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
to to um mitigate some of the uh general
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
fund usage year you can see that we have
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit of federal funds F this is
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
the only F reimbursement that we are
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for and that is tied to out of
 
01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.349 align:start position:0%
eligible for and that is tied to out of
state

01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
travel the rest of it is General
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
funds 2934 the railroad rehab loan um uh
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
this is set by um RSA 228 uh
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
66a it allows for loans to be available
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
to railroads for
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation currently it's primarily
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
the Cog Railway that has these loans uh
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
but it's not restricted to only the
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
C and it is a revolving fund if I oh if
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
I may ask really quickly um is it a loan
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
taken by a private
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
organization I'm just trying to
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
understand then why the uh you know 165
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
shows up in our budget
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
165,000 so uh under statute there are
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
certain classifications of of railroads
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
class three railroads in the Cog
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
railroad that can apply for this
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan Fund then we issue the
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
loan the the state goes out to bond and
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
then the uh repayment to the the
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
principal um in the interest is what
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
shows back up here in
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
2934 so basically we're just receiving
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
the money from the private entity and
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
then paying it to the we are the
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
intermediary and just responsible for
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
managing it correct and uh
 
01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
okay this is why we have a matching
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
source of funds and then the Deb service
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
to other agencies so it's a zero sum
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
game more or less for the Department
 
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:07.789 align:start position:0%
game more or less for the Department
thank

01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
you isn't some of this
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
money since the state owns all the
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
railroad tracks when somebody wants to
 
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
run a train on them they have to pay the
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
state then we end up virtually giving
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
them everything back to repair the
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
tracks right uh so yeah so the the is
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
not owned by the state or the Department
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
of Transportation they've been the last
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
the recipient the last probably three
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
rounds so they're making that investment
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
in their privately owned infrastructure
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
and repaying US private railroads um
 
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
that own active trackage in the state
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
are also um allowed we have not in
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
recent years in my probably 14 years in
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
in rail had anyone who operates on a
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
state Own Line put in for so we haven't
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
been using a loan to essentially fix our
 
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
own infrastructure um in the past I
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
understand and we've had tenant
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%
railroads who have applied for funds to
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
create sidings to go to a shipper or
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
receiver and they have constructed those
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
on private property so we have not sort
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
of used it as a loan for ourselves we
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
rely on the special railroad fund which
 
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
is accounting T accounting unit 2991
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
which we'll get to
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
shortly which funds are so we're not
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
talking about we haven't got to that one
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
yet of the tracks we own yes right
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
you two 936 is reimbursable maintenance
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
and repair it is a placeholder it's a
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
placeholder for storm damage and federal
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursements that would come through
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
that and primarily that would be FEMA
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
placeholder last year you can see that
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
we spent
 
01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.470 align:start position:0%
we spent
$77,000

01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
$77,000
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
there 2937 compensation and benefits um
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
so these class lines are are sometimes a
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
little vague so 042 the class line is
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
for retiree Health those are new charges
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
that have been assessed to the general
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
fund that that's why you see nothing for
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
actual expend expenditures on in 24 and
 
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
25 um we have a placeholder for
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation because we
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
don't we never know what those things
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
are going to be but we need the the line
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then workers compensation um which
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
is pro which is a number provided by uh
 
01:07:17.359 --> 01:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
is pro which is a number provided by uh
administrative

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
special railroad funds right and this is
 
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
what represented while I think you're
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
referring to so this is for state owned
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
railroads um it is the we collect uh
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
railroad crossing and Freight fees and
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
the revenues are used to maintain and
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
operate the lines The Operators get the
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
funds to do so shall
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
we sure so this uh the special railroad
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
fund is set up under statute
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
22868 establishes the special Ro Fund in
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
22869 um is prescriptive in how the
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
funds can be used 20% of the revenue
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
that we receive from our tenant
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
railroads in the form of a user fee um
 
01:08:09.789 --> 01:08:09.799 align:start position:0%
are paid back proportionally to the
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities through which the
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
railroads operate so the department Nets
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
essentially 80% of the railroad user
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
fees um derived from our tenant
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
railroads those user fees are
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
essentially percents of their gross
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
operating Revenue uh for our four
 
01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
Freight operators we get 5% of their
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
annual gross Freight operating revenue
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
is a user fee paid to the state under
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
contract those uh Freight operators are
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
required to put a minimum of 20% of
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
their gross operating back into the
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the line so the state is
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
essentially um netting 25% of their
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
gross Freight Revenue either in uh a fee
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
paid to the state that goes through this
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
budget or in the Improvement in state
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
owned infrastructure for our two tourist
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
Excursion railroads roads we have we get
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
receive 10% of their annual gross ticket
 
01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
revenues and 10% of their annual um
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
gross revenue is then put back in So for
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
for those um two entities 20% of gross
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
operating is paid to or invested in
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
state infrastructure we take the
 
01:09:16.269 --> 01:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
remainder of the user fees that we net
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
as well as payments for um driveway
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
Crossings leases and and other uses or
 
01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
impacts to state owned railroad property
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
and again through Force account we go to
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
governor and coun we use our tenant
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
railroads to make those improvements to
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
the railroad system whether it's ties
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
surfacing drainage cover Bridges things
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
of that nature we partner with these six
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
tenant railroads to maintain the state's
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as best we can with the
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
property thank you so quick question you
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
were saying that we are requiring the
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
railroads to spend 20% of their grow to
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
maintain the rail and whatnot how close
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
are we looking at the work that they are
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
doing and the costs that they are
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
accounting for to make sure they are
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable rather than on exercising
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
Creative Accounting there yeah so good
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
question so we have a railroad
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
operations engineer position that's
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
budgeted in so there's no State staff
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the um special railroad fund
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
the railroad staff is all in 2931 which
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
we had previously looked at there's one
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
railroad operations engineer in
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2931 that person becomes
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
sort of a clerk of of the works on the
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
projects and they go out and oversee the
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
projects and um look at the plans in
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
advance they talk and meet with the
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
contractors to make sure they're
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
qualified we have another staff member
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
that is the project manager the contract
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
manager for these contracts and they go
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
out and do annual audits to look at all
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
the Maintenance of Way work that is done
 
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
and we require in advance what their
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
rate fee for the year will be for their
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
for in their laborer um for rental of
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
any track equipment that will be used or
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
yellow um construction equipment so we
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
compare that to um if we were going out
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
to bid for some of our own projects what
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
are the rates that we would get so we we
 
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
do it a multitude of ways thank you so
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
much that's an excellent answer I
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
thanks and that is the end of the first
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
division the second division that we
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
have is the administration division the
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
first Au is
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
2938 2938 is Debt Service it pays for
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
the bonding of our fund 30 capital
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
projects or the projects that get
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
approved in
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
hb25 um the timing of of the payments
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
here depends really on Treasury bonding
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
and the timing of the do project
 
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
expenditures and when they
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
occur and that is 100% um Highway
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
funding and I would say we've made some
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
assumptions for the for the budget as
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
far as what the capital budget um would
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
would sustain so um I I know that's uh
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know another another committee but
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a Nexus there that
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
um that we'll be discussing as
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you in regards to this amount
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
of uh debt payments that we are
 
01:12:23.229 --> 01:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
making do we have an estimate on whether
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
the you know current amount of PR
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
principle that we ow is supposed to uh
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
start decreasing at some point or is it
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a rolling situation would we
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
keep adding new loans as fast as we pay
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
the old
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
ones it's more of a bigger thing yeah I
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
know it's a complex question the best
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
the overall capital budget gets rolled
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
into the overall state state debt so so
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
the loans I think are a maximum of 10
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
years so they're constantly rolling
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
right because every two years you get
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
new capital projects s so you're paying
 
01:12:59.629 --> 01:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
for those and you're paying off older
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
ones so I would say that on your in your
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh question it would be ongoing rolling
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
much but I know that discussion when it
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
gets to the capital budget and
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
discussing that um the overall Outlook
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
from the from from from the state's
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
perspective I think the Department of
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
Treasury would have a much better handle
 
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
on that overall outstanding debt and
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
2939 these are items that the dot pays
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
to other
 
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
agencies are you okay I'm
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah thank you this is a small
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
amount but I know that there have been
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
people who have cons they have concerns
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
about the dams and um functioning and
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know re Rehabilitation of some of
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
the dams you have got a little bit here
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's over you know someplace else but
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
can you speak to um the impact that has
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
on you because some of those if the Dam
 
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
breaks it affects the road and just the
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
Nexus around uh transportation's role
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
with Dam
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance um I I would say we have a
 
01:14:12.679 --> 01:14:14.189 align:start position:0%
maintenance um I I would say we have a
fairly

01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
um limited limited role with the overall
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
Dam maintenance there are some
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
facilities that that that we have um
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
roadway embankments that are
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
um classified as as a as a dam there's
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
some in the Sea Coast the you know
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
whatever I forget the pond there and and
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
and Ry is is one and uh other ones but
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
there uh so so in those situations where
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
um we're held to the same Dam damn owner
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
rules that that that others are and we
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
managed those uh specifically um where
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
where they interact our facilities but
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
the broader
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh picture of Dam dam maintenance I
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
think is under um Department of
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um I'd like to bring your attention
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
to um class line 027 transferred to oit
 
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
the reduction here is really a reduction
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh to meet budget targets but it also
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
includes two lost positions um it's two
 
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
embedded it positions at do so dot will
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
just a quick question you are saying
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
that it's a loss of two positions but
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the reduction that's
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
significantly less than the cost of two
 
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
positions I'm assuming there were some
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
other increases that offset some of the
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
you um a transfer to other state
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
program and the 00 four under revenue is
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
an embedded it position at the turnpike
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
system which has to pay for its
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
funded general fund uh overhead 2940
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
this really are payments made to
 
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
administrative services for services
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
provided um both direct and indirect so
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
transfers plant and property is rent for
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
the Morton Building and um indirect
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
costs are the administrative um Services
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
we call it the
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
swap but it's indirect Services provided
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
services and if I may very quickly I
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
apologize obviously understand what
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
indirect costs are in general but yes in
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
this particular case um it just seems to
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
be quite a hefty amount of indirect cost
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
compared with the rest of the unit can
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
you give me a bit of an understanding of
 
01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.470 align:start position:0%
you give me a bit of an understanding of
what

01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
exactly would go into those indirect
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
costs for that particular unit so
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
indirect costs from from the Department
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services would would
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
include Staffing and services provided
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
by um the department of uh the division
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
of personnel the uh the accounting
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau the um folks manag purchasing
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
property anything that would provide a
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
service overall to all
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
agencies oh uh plants and properties
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and that is 100% Highway funds
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
right but that I mean that that
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
that assessment is not unique to the do
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
I think that that that assessment that
 
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
Das does is is
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh to all agencies I know I'm asking you
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
guys about your share of it yes uh can I
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
also ask about the U significant uh
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
change from 26 to 27 in the 064 line the
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
benefits retired and so on I mean that's
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
a million dollars jump again budget
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
numbers that were given to us and do you
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
know where they come from in terms of
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
how they were projected is that the
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
estimate from the retirement system
 
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
what is the source to the best of your
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
estimate we don't get any information ah
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
well I would refer that to to
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
presentation

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to clarify retire health so
 
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
that those would be numbers that risk
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
management at admin services with their
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
presumably Actuarial estimates for the
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
next two years will bill out to all the
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
agencies of retirees in the system and
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
and probably anticipated new
 
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
retirements During the period so that
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
that is a Statewide
 
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
um calculation that's done and then
 
01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
agency thank you right
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
3038 is the executive office and that
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
funds the execu office um so funds the
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the directors and staff
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
except for the director of of um Dart uh
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
funds and here we have Blended uh the
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
revenues for several of the accounting
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
units that you're going to see are going
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
to be Blended um these accounting units
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
will receive um indirect costs uh
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
indirect revenue from turnpikes the
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
turnpike system from the general funds
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
They will receive indirect federal funds
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
managements you'll notice the positions
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
here so if you look at the bottom you'll
 
01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
see position count increase it's really
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
not an increase in positions it's a it's
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
a shifting of positions from turnpikes
 
01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.950 align:start position:0%
a shifting of positions from turnpikes
to

01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
camps from in the last budget cycle in
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
the last last budget cycle but the the
 
01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
the costs weren't allocated right so
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're making a correction on where they
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
belong but it's not an increase in
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
headcount from from Turnpike two from
 
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system to um amps this this
 
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.750 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system to um amps this this
accounting

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
unit right which find Highway basically
 
01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
the next item is a new accounting unit
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
for us it's 3174 it is the safety office
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
um we have elevated the safety the
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
safety program at do
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
safety and so the funding for this uh
 
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
accounting unit has been split out of
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
another uh unit it's Highway design 30
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
25 so 3025 we took some of the we took
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
some of the expenses um some of the
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
positions eight of the positions and
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
finance division of finance
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh we've already had these conversations
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
about the the unfund of positions Etc
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
mhm um and the funding is still the same
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
except we do have some agency income and
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
that is just print shop revenue from um
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
Works we move to the division of policy
 
01:22:17.159 --> 01:22:18.830 align:start position:0%
Works we move to the division of policy
and

01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
administration and the first Au is 2056
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
the office of federal compliance or
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
access opport opportunity and compliance
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what page are we on I'm sorry
 
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.910 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what page are we on I'm sorry
page

01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
793 that division the division only had
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
one Bureau so we move to it the next
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
one office of access opportunity and
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
compliance um fully Federal uh it's
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
Federal funded and uh indirect
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
again nothing uh un stop me if you need
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
to um employee training employee
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
training we see some significant
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
variance because we shifted uh the
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
funding of the training program to
 
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
Federal the federal program um the
 
01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639 align:start position:0%
federal uh fhwa has a 504e program that
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
allows for training travel subscription
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
and dues and so instead of using Highway
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
funds primarily we're using federal
 
01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
funds right
 
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
okay and well we've also ramped this up
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
to really focus a lot on employee
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
development um and uh hopefully
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
so and we move to the Operations
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
Division you want me to go through the
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay what account I'll give uh
 
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
Danielle a break what what account is
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
that pardon me which account 2928 2928
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
so this is the uh we're moving into the
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh division of
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
operations uh this org is uh is where we
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
bucket all of the winter winter
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs
 
01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
um again this is this is one of the this
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
is one of the areas where I believe we
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
are uh purposefully un underfunding from
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
from what we feel that we would
 
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
typically um typically need um if you
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's spread
 
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
um again we have purposely kind of
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
underfunded this area to to meet budget
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
targets but this is this is where um
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
ideally we would we would propose to
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
fund the uh winter maintenance incentive
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
program uh to uh have have volunteers to
 
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
continue that would be shown typically
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
in um that class 17 employee special
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
payments um again we believe that that
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
should be about $2.8 million more than
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
what is what is budgeted there um and
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
then the various class lines for current
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
expense for
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
leases um slow so class on 17 and we're
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
under window maintenance correct yes yes
 
01:25:22.109 --> 01:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
turn down to it so that shows not a very
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
large a big big decrease no if you look
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
at the actual if you look at the 24
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
actuals that's high and then it goes way
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
down yes right that funds that funds the
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
retention incentive program so so that
 
01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
program is is happening and it happened
 
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
in 24 we had we came to uh get
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
permission for that and so it is funded
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
there but we could not fund it in 20 in
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
26 27 so that's why the numbers are are
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
much different that retention incentive
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
hits several class lines but it hits CL
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh class 17 the most but it also hits of
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
course class 60 which is taxes and
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
benefits and it also hits class
 
01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:07.639 align:start position:0%
49 which is uh to pay for other
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
employees from other agencies who come
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
and help support winter maintenance as
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
lines so I just point that out this was
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
one of our priorities we can make
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations there isn't uh but but
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
those are some of the um you know
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
additional needs that we'd like have
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
identified and would like
 
01:26:36.159 --> 01:26:43.870 align:start position:0%
identified and would like
consideration

01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so overall the um and and I think on
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of when you look at the
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
total um total there too if you look at
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
the fy2 24 expenses of around 40 million
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
compared to what we're we're budgeting
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
of around 30 30.4
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
30.5 um if it was a if it was a very
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
light winter in those years that that
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
might be adequate but um we we we know
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
particularly based on you know FY 245
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
for example adjusted
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
authorized uh that was $32 million we
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
know that we have uh gone to fiscal for
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance transfers of around
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
$10 million so you know that actual
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
number is up around probably $42 million
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of actual expenditures so it's
 
01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
an indication it's it's a it's a it's a
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's a range it's a ballpark of of I
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
think where uh this org is uh
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
underfunded so and the other the other
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
two class lines that that are typically
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
underfunded are 20 class 20 and class 20
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
is used to purchase salt and sand and
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
liquids uh for surface treatment and
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
class 22
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
which is to pay for the rented uh
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
contractor equipment which makes up
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.950 align:start position:0%
 
Fleet

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
you repres hack and Phillips quick
 
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair um could you
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
describe a little bit about that 48% of
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
rented Fleet what are we talking about
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
um things that we have have to rent
 
01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
um things that we have have to rent
because

01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
our uh schedule of Investments on our
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
own Fleet is behind so we have to find
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
replacements or how maybe just some more
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
context pleas I think the context we we
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
are generally staffed for for summer
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance uh we augment our winter
 
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs with with hired plows
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
so um about 5050 or 48% um if if you
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
notice when when you when when you're
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
out in a storm or something you'll
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
you'll probably see a orange dot plow if
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
there's a if there's a secondary or an
 
01:28:59.950 --> 01:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
auxiliary plow it's probably a uh a non-
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
orange plow which is which is someone
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
we've hired to to plow for us um is that
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
Affair Dave Rodriguez our uh assistant
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner former director of
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
operations and and can speak to that but
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's primarily we don't staff
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
for full weight di mens we rely on the
 
01:29:19.109 --> 01:29:19.119 align:start position:0%
hired plows that's correct and that that
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
has been how the department efficiently
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
provides winter maintenance for
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
um the history of the the department
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
we've always relied on hired equipment
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
to supplement um pieces that we don't
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
own and in the case of this winter
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
winter plow trucks and others we we rent
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
um trucks with operators to provide that
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
service thank you would it be fair to
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
say that because of the seasonal SL
 
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
shortterm needs for winter maintenance
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
this is the most costeffective model
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much money we'd have
 
01:29:58.590 --> 01:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
for the budget absolutely yes that's
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
very fair to say thank
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
you I'm Murray thank you very much um
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
yeah we had a non- orange plow come
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
through Newcastle which C which was my
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
phone was ringing off the hook as was
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
the chief of police's phone was ringing
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
off the hook oh know cost quite the stir
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
so there's a slight increase in the
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
highway fun overall the
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
253 and here you know there's your $2
 
01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.669 align:start position:0%
253 and here you know there's your $2
million

01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
um uh reduction um I'm just curious if
 
01:30:27.790 --> 01:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
overall if you can provide you know a
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
larger picture of where you're using the
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
additional 2 million that's coming in
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
for I guess is
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
that class line yeah H I'm sorry you
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
know I just your rent of maintenance is
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
so critical and you're reducing that by
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
the 2 million overall you've got um a
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
slight increase in I guess this is going
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
2027 of 253 million on this I'm looking
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
on this thingy here
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
um so if you can just tie in where that
 
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
you know I it's a very slight increase
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the overall effect but how have you
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
made the decision to reduce this as a um
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
with that slight increase you know what
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
I'm asking I do now okay thank you um I
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
think i' we may have to do a little bit
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
more digging to get you a straight
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
answer on that it is it is a lar we are
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
a large organization yeah uh yeah I
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm looking for is uh this is
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
is a priority decision and so just it
 
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be very detailed but um
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
just your way of thinking about how you
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:40.590 align:start position:0%
 
certainly

01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
um moving on the next Bureau uh uh 35
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
The Mechanical Services Bureau um again
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
that is uh that is when when we talked
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
about um Le
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
um primarily in the class line of um 030
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
equipment new replacement um we would uh
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
ideally like to see about $1 million a
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
year is what we feel the uh ongoing uh
 
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
Fleet replacement schedule warrants um
 
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
you can see we're scheduled we we have
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted for about uh half that roughly
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in 20
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
2027 um and I would again point out it's
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
not reflected in the uh adjusted
 
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
authorized or in the 2024 actual
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
expenses because um we did have a
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation of about 4.8
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
million at the end of last budget in
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
recognition of of the continued need to
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh not put uh you know you know not to
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
continue to incur def deferred
 
01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance of of the fleet past budgets
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've put a lot of effort through
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
capital budget Appropriations and other
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
things to um to um uh focus on the fleet
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
counter many years of of disinvestment
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
and deferred maintenance in in the fleet
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
so we've we've got it into a uh a pretty
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
good a good place and we would hate to
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
see us lose lose ground
 
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
so we have made some uh some thoughtful
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
increases here in class 20 there is
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
really we're we're seeing 7% increases
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
in part costs um and we need to maintain
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
a equipment and so we've made some
 
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
increases there and then in
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
um in the class 37 line you see a jump
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
there and that really is for some
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
specialized diagnostic software that
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
will that will make will help us be more
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
efficient um right now we're using 11
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
pieces of software to diagnose equipment
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
and there's there's um there's a product
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
out there that can combine all of those
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
into one and to have one piece of
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
equipment and so that's what you're
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
right any moving ahead the next uh organ
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
or unit 3007 is the Highway Maintenance
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau um again that is all that is uh a
 
01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
big part of our operations uh budget is
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
is the Highway Maintenance Bureau um one
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
point I would point out if you look at
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh line 029
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh inter agency
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
transfers you'll notice that expense
 
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
there in
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
2627 again that is we we discussed the
 
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
uas position and the highway funds that
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
are going to fund that position that is
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
where that's the tie that's where it's
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
reflected on on the on the highway fund
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
side of the of the
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
um of the budget so that expense is
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
reflected in agency income um where that
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
position is
 
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
um overall a generally kind of uh flat
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know flat budget all those all
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
those class lines primarily to um again
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
meet meet budget targets um but this
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
would be probably an area where um you
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
know we didn't identify additional needs
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
per se
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
but um as as as we meet budget Targets
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
this is where uh you know some of the
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
areas that in terms of deferred
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance that we would uh ideally
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
like to do more um we are restricted by
 
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
by the budget here we're on 3007 right
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
correct so this's going to jump from 24
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
actual and then on in your expenses
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
right that's correct that reflects
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
mostly the changes what you see that is
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
is in uh class 10 which which shows
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies right so it would be in 10 and
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
60 primarily that that goes into our you
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
know the lapse that that we experience
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
rates representative Roy can you explain
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
did I miss something under benefits here
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
it went from 15 up to 24 and then up to
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
25 million under 060 we're in Highway
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
Maintenance yep yeah again again that's
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
a direct reflection of the of the uh 25%
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate that we have so the actual
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures in
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
24 uh were only $15 million because we
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
had a 25% vacancy rate um if we were
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
fully staffed um in the permanent
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
budgeted positions uh it should be um
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
more in line with the $25 million that's
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
shown in FY 25 26 and 27
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
so and the 26 and 27 amounts also
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
include large increases in those
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
benefits that we were
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
provided so it's compounded yeah
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
incentives is that or benefit increases
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
being what I'm not sure I understand I
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
think health insurance is I think the
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
largest increase that is seen and
 
01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
reflected in the 26 and 27 budgets okay
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you is that is that your
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
question what class 60 comprises or yeah
 
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's taxes and any employee
 
01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
benefits paid by the state yeah which is
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
primarily the health insurance tax
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
health insurance the portion of
 
01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
primarily um and again back in the
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
source of funds it is
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
um it is uh you know primarily Highway
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
fund there's a small amount of agency
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
income uh some sponsorship Revenue um
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
that that comes from
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh vehicle service Patrol that
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
operate the next uh or 2008 Bridge
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance Bureau uh Bridge maintenance
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
is our Bureau that maintains uh the
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
existing state uh bridges in this uh in
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
this org there was one uh position one
 
01:38:22.589 --> 01:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
full-time position that that was um
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
unfunded to to
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
um to meet budget targets um again a
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
relatively flat uh uh flat budget all
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
the way across with some um specific uh
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
needs identified uh again I think you
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
had called it Danielle the
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
um thoughtful increases in certain lines
 
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
as are specific um items to be addressed
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
for example uh class 30 new equipment
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
replacement um there's a slight increase
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
there in 26 uh we know there are some uh
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
specific uh trailer compress trailer
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
compressors that that we're budgeting
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
replacements for things like that um we
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
have increased class 50 a little bit uh
 
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of uh hopefully trying
 
01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:19.159 align:start position:0%
to have some
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
um uh temporary uh hires or uh and and
 
01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
fill some and and help offset some of
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
the some of the
 
01:39:31.589 --> 01:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
vacancies we in Bridge maintenance yes
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
yep 3 801 oh there's the increase okay
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
yeah up and down probably probably the
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
largest increase you'll see is in class
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
103 and that is for bridge washing
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
primarily right but the numbers seem be
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
bouncing around so class 5th you just
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned down from FY 24 actual to 2 uh
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
4 to 25 which I get but then up and then
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
back down again in
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
27 am I reading that right up to 80 27
 
01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
is down to meet budget targets
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
right okay great but what because 26 you
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
figur You' didn't need to or something
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
we would know we would still need it but
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
we still had to meet a Target so we had
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
to cut something okay so you did it in
 
01:40:17.589 --> 01:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
just the final
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
right we hope we won't have to need them
 
01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
if you know primarily we use these to to
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
supplement vac ancies so if we could
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
hire we wouldn't need as many temps
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
right so we could be also hopeful in 27
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't need as much I get now
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
okay um and again the primary source of
 
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
funds there is um um federal funds and
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
Highway funds primarily Highway funds
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
there are uh work efforts that bridge
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance does on federal aid elig Bri
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
federal aid eligible bridges that we
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
direct fund uh those eligible activities
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
for um as well as some um indirect cost
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
recoveries from Turnpike and Inter
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
agency transfers that so is that kind of
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
a matching funds thing between Federal
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
and Highway or they're just totally
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
unrelated you get the highway funds you
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
get the federal funds for whatever you
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
want and then you also have Highway
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
funds or something else typically most
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance typically federal funds
 
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
would would not support maintenance
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
activities uh so in this account you're
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
just getting federal funds some of the
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
bridge work that we do Bri Bridges the
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
focus on on on Bridges the bridge
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance does some of the
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation and stuff is federally
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
eligible type of work for example on the
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance side most Highway
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
Maintenance activities are not federal
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
aid eligible the the plowing the
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
ditching the the maintaining of the
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
system the bridge maintenance activities
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
working on specific federal aid eligible
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
Bridges uh and the work that they do to
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
bring them back into service whether
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's a a deck replacement or some of the
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
the other um work is is eligible so we
 
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
take advantage and and try to um um
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
apply those funds as appropriate but
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
those funds in this particular case
 
01:42:06.669 --> 01:42:06.679 align:start position:0%
don't require a match that's basically
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
funds you can get that apply to certain
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that federal funds are
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
available for well the federal funds do
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
require a match but but when you look at
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
the uh High f is that the highway fund
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
match that's what I was asking it's
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
compr it's it's included in that okay
 
01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.870 align:start position:0%
compr it's it's included in that okay
you

01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
yeah the match typically isn't as much
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
of a of a of a of an issue because it's
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
being done with Department forces so all
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
of our Personnel time and and things
 
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
like that would would go toward the
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
would go toward the
 
01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.830 align:start position:0%
would go toward the
match

01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
match
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative haen Phillips
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
thank you I was just looking at line uh
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
400 for construction repair materials
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
and it looks like there was a pretty big
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
swing upward in 26 27 could you give us
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
a little background I misspoke when I
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
said it was line 103 it really is line
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
400 I
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
apologize I did the same thing yesterday
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
so that is one of the things with with
 
01:43:04.109 --> 01:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
um we should be washing Bridges washing
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
the salt off washing the material off
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
quite frequently again with some of the
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
vacancies and stuff we um have not been
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
able to achieve those targets uh this
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
past year we had uh we had done a uh a
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
cont a bridge washing contract and
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's what that um line item um
 
01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.629 align:start position:0%
that's what that um line item um
reflects

01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
reflects
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
workout the next uh organizational code
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
on page 802 is our traffic operations
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau um again they take care of all
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
the signs all the signals all of the all
 
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
striping uh along along the uh along the
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
state highways
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
um there are some again some thoughtful
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
changes as there are specific items that
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking to uh address uh in in the
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
budget for example
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
um I I I look at uh
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
um technology Hardware class 37 there is
 
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
a uh an increase there there are some
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
specific um you know equipment updates
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
for remote accessing of uh uh traffic
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
signals and some of the software to
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
support that that that is contained in
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
in that um we also have an increase in
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
class 46 um in the consultant line item
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh again to meet some of our obligations
 
01:44:36.669 --> 01:44:36.679 align:start position:0%
to review
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
um uh driveway applications and and
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
permit applications and some traffic
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
impact studies um we do not again with
 
01:44:46.589 --> 01:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
the vacancies necessarily have the
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
Personnel to keep up with that so we do
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
bring on some consultant help to um
 
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
perform those reviews as well what line
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
number was that again that was line 46
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:18.109 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um was there a question or well
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
there wasn't but then I see I'm looking
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
line 50 I was getting to that yeah on
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
um again that that's uh you know per
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
personal service those are the temporary
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
hires typically we would we would hire
 
01:45:41.589 --> 01:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh a bunch a lot of seasonal help to
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
help uh uh man the uh the striping
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles that that that stripe the
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
highways through through the summer
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
months um we still have it uh budgeted
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the ideal but if you look at the
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
actual expenses in in 2024 we have been
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
very um we have been very uh we have not
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
been very successful in in trying to
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
hire seasonal help for for the wages
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
that that we pay so we're competing with
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
McDonald's and and others and Dunkin
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
Donuts that uh uh you know paying more
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
than than than than uh than the state is
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
offering um we still get the work done
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
we are pressing in into service other uh
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance folks to uh to do
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
that seasonal work again it's at the
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
expense of some maintenance activities
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
that they would that they would
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
typically be doing um but um but that's
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's what that line implies and we've
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
continued to budget it with the uh with
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
with the anticipation and the Hope in
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
our efforts that we would still try to
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
recruit and still try to hire that
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
seasonal Health to staff those um
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
historically we haven't been very
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
successful in the last few years with
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
that and then again it is a split funded
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the funding there is
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
inter agency transfers for uh supporting
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
the work that traffic agent does
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
primarily on the on the turnpike system
 
01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
agency and directs uh and again some of
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
the federal funds um again Federal
 
01:47:19.589 --> 01:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
direct and indirect uh some of the
 
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
direct federal funds that we apply to
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
Traffic Division
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh the striping activities uh we have
 
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
categorized that we've classified that
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
as as a as a safety Improvement to keep
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
up with uh um the visibility of the line
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
striping so that has been
 
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
um approved as a federal aid eligible
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
expense so we direct Bill Federal
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
Highway uh for those uh striping
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
activities on federal aid eligible
 
01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.270 align:start position:0%
activities on federal aid eligible
highways

01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
highways
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
so the next line L uh 31 331 on page 804
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
is reimbursable maintenance and and
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
repair um again it's where we kind of
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
bucket some of those uh some of those uh
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
some of those costs for that uh
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repair that ideally will
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
be reimbursable storm events uh FEMA
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement things like things like
 
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.790 align:start position:0%
reimbursement things like things like
that

01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and the revenue is a placeholder so
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know what we would get for
 
01:48:25.589 --> 01:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
federal revenue so the revenue is parked
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
in 005 but it'll probably be a split um
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
0000 I think that's a D um really is
 
01:48:37.589 --> 01:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
more FEMA it's mostly FEMA
 
01:48:37.599 --> 01:48:39.790 align:start position:0%
more FEMA it's mostly FEMA
related

01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
yeah moving ahead uh on page 805 um or
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
for asset maintenance and critical
 
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
repair this is the org to uh repair dot
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
assets that fall into uh disrepair or
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
fail um we have about um 90 uh Patrol
 
01:49:02.109 --> 01:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
sheds and various facilities around the
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
state so this is uh where we uh would
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
fund things like heating systems or
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
other things like that and the
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining mainten M maintenance of our
 
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
own uh do
 
01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
own uh do
facilities

01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
um and again that source of Revenue is
 
01:49:20.159 --> 01:49:21.030 align:start position:0%
um and again that source of Revenue is
is

01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
100% um
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh 100% Highway funds um again we have
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
limited things to meet budget budget
 
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
targets uh you look at FY 24 actual
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
expend expenditures um certainly some um
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know additional repairs for things
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
that had failed that that we had to um
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we had to take care
 
01:49:48.189 --> 01:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
of uh uh org 352 at the bottom of that
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
page is our transportation systems
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
management and operations uh Bureau
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
um again relatively
 
01:50:04.350 --> 01:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
um flat or modest uh increases as as we
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
look through um some of the individual
 
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
um class lines um and again this is
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
multif funded from uh a number of
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
different sources um there are inter
 
01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:19.430 align:start position:0%
different sources um there are inter
agency

01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
transfers um because this is the trans
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh um traffic Management Center a lot
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
of their activity is focused on on the
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
freeway and Interstate systems uh so I
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
95 and the F Turnpike for example so um
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh per an Mo MOA internally about
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
49% of of this bureau's
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
um revenue is it comes from the turnpike
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
comes from the turnpike system for the
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
services that they provide monitoring
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
assets um moving on to page
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
807 uh org 355 is our inmate maintenance
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
crew um we do uh we do try to uh solicit
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
and and and utilize in inmate um
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance Crews typically for trash
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
collection uh or um tree clearing along
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
the highways things like that
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
um so yeah go ahead thank you with
 
01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
regards to that uh I know you you're
 
01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
trying to utilize um this opportunity is
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
there what would be the barriers for
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
increasing this opportunity I'm going
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
back to hear you talking about things
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
like striping the highway and some of
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
those sorts of activities is that a job
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
that would not be open to an inmate
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance kind of crew for what you
 
01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
know for a variety of reasons are there
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
other opportunities here to expand and
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the you know not take
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
advantage opportunity you know I don't
 
01:52:03.629 --> 01:52:03.639 align:start position:0%
know if it's volunteer per se but uh
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
there is most of these costs here
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
associated with the supervision of those
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
uh maintenance crew so that the the um
 
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
the uh class 50 the Personnel Service is
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
to is to hire and and pay for a a guard
 
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
to come with them the class 22 is for a
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
a a um a a van to transport them but um
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
do you know Alexis I know a little bit
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
very good Alexis Martin is our director
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
of policy and administration good
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
morning one of the barriers is um that
 
01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
many um of these individuals do not have
 
01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:34.830 align:start position:0%
many um of these individuals do not have
a

01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:52:39.069 --> 01:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
license so they're unable to drive um we
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh do also uh in the past we have done
 
01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
um a uh you know prisoner to fulltime
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
Employee Program through the Bureau of
 
01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
traffic um has not been successful as we
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
hoped um we did have uh a a couple of
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who came through um secured
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
full-time employment and then moved on
 
01:53:03.310 --> 01:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
um to other things which was great um so
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
we do do still have that relationship
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
with the transitional work center um and
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
only um certain uh uh offenses uh are
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
allowed over um but uh something we
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
continue to do um they send us the staff
 
01:53:22.109 --> 01:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
and we continue to work with them and
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
and offer them a full-time opportunity
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
interested is there a skill issue
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
involved in this and is there also an
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
issue of um people who whether you know
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not they can belong to a
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
involved um so anyone uh part-time or
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
full-time um can join the union if they
 
01:53:49.069 --> 01:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
so choose um the skill issue is many of
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
these Physicians are um called a uh uh
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
how we maintain or one so the
 
01:53:58.350 --> 01:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications are uh three months of
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
employment and pretty much anything um
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
and then we skill you up through um
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
through the process usually over the
 
01:54:05.119 --> 01:54:06.229 align:start position:0%
through the process usually over the
summer

01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
striping um participating in those
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
activities coning um those kinds of
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
things so um when in the past when the
 
01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
part-time employment for striping was
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
really a pipeline to full-time
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
employment for seasonal worker
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
um so they would get some experience in
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance under their belt and then be
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
able to come on full-time staff to the
 
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance group um and become
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
an HM uh one or two hopefully within a
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
year and then move throughout um the
 
01:54:37.239 --> 01:54:39.550 align:start position:0%
year and then move throughout um the
maintenance

01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
you on page 808 the next uh item
 
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.510 align:start position:0%
you on page 808 the next uh item
uh

01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
366 is salted Wells this pays for uh
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
replacement of contaminated Wells this
 
01:54:58.030 --> 01:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
has been uh generally
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
um a a a a set amount that that we've
 
01:55:04.629 --> 01:55:04.639 align:start position:0%
have put aside to to address this issue
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh I know costs are increasing and uh
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know we are concerned of of you know
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
um uh increasing backlogs of these of
 
01:55:15.629 --> 01:55:15.639 align:start position:0%
these of these needs but this was an
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
established program to address an issue
 
01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
that had uh been been been um identified
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
number number of years ago we've
 
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
continued to fund it at about this about
 
01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
this level in every budget um but but um
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
I I know we do have a uh growing backlog
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.950 --> 01:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
so but again this was set fairly level
 
01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
targets uh or 30 3198 is a fuel
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
distribution um the Department of
 
01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation runs runs the state's uh
 
01:55:57.629 --> 01:55:57.639 align:start position:0%
fuel uh fueling system U this provides
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
do this provides fuel to do other state
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
agencies the university system um and
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
there is another line item while I get
 
01:56:08.109 --> 01:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
to Beyond which is related with the
 
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
municipal fuel because uh uh
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities also utilize the state um
 
01:56:13.119 --> 01:56:14.669 align:start position:0%
municipalities also utilize the state um
fueling

01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
fueling
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
Network um and again just generally
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
um generally level level um level level
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
funded or reduced to meet budget targets
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh and um a big part of this Revenue
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
comes from the agency income there at
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
the bottom in 009 which is uh you know
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
revenue from the other state agencies
 
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety or others that are
 
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
using the state fuel Network as well as
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
our own um fuel usage there and um the
 
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.669 align:start position:0%
our own um fuel usage there and um the
highway

01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
funds code four uh 5032 is our oversized
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
and overweight permitting section this
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
is a revolving fund for um for the
 
01:56:57.790 --> 01:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
operation and administration of our
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
permit section um so it's s supported by
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
the fees that that we pay that that
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
people pay for uh for their oversiz and
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
overweight permits um and and that's
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
shown at the bottom there uh the source
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
of funds is is that revolving
 
01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
fund code 5034 is for our lift bridge
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
operators um they maintain the bridges
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
and and the lift Bridges particularly in
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh the Sarah along bridge and
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
the Memorial
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
Bridge um just want on my mind you
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned fees so there are some fees
 
01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
that you all control and set up and that
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
sort of thing such as the over oversized
 
01:57:38.189 --> 01:57:38.199 align:start position:0%
overweight permitting fee yes could you
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
just provide us not right now but a list
 
01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
of what those fees are that you're you
 
01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:45.679 align:start position:0%
guys deal with and control and and when
 
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
the last time was they were rais and if
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts for raising them
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
it safe to assume that goes into the Gen
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
the highway fund well for particularly
 
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
the over size and overweight that goes
 
01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
into a revolving fund that's used just
 
01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
to support that activity okay but it's
 
01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:07.719 align:start position:0%
the same sort of it's a dedicated fund
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
that could be it is a a statutory
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund yes but it could be used
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
ways that we've discussed previously
 
01:58:22.589 --> 01:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
represent Murray now just a quick
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
question informational and I won't
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
mention the little elephant in the room
 
01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
but how many lift bridges are there in
 
01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:31.310 align:start position:0%
but how many lift bridges are there in
the

01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:37.229 --> 01:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
being elep little the elephant in the
 
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
room being Ry Newcastle Ry yeah yeah
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah and it's funny you
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
looked at with uh if you look at uh
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the some of the
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
budget line and and that uh if you look
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
at uh class 50 Personnel Services you'll
 
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
see reduction from 26 to 27 that that's
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
a reflection of of the Hampton Harbor
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
Bridge uh the the the new uh fix ban
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
being being open and the and the lift
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
bridge going away there uh by
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
2027 that
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly right yeah and Counting
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
yeah representative d
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
does Maine participate in the
 
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
sarong quarter yes and if you look at
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
the uh uh uh the fund line underneath
 
01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
that 005 the private local funds uh that
 
01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:36.679 align:start position:0%
line represents the state of Maine's
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
share uh for the expenditures in in the
 
01:59:44.589 --> 01:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.599 --> 01:59:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:59:50.589 --> 01:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
um so that's the that that's uh that
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
covers the um
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
division of project uh division of
 
01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
operations moving along to 812 we get
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
into our Bureau of uh I mean the
 
02:00:02.069 --> 02:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
division of project development these
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
are the bureaus that um are responsible
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
for the planning design oversight of
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
construction of our of our of our
 
02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:10.510 align:start position:0%
construction of our of our of our
Highway

02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
Highway
 
02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:13.750 align:start position:0%
Highway
program

02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
um uh starting off with the uh uh or
 
02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.629 align:start position:0%
um uh starting off with the uh uh or
code

02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
code
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
3021 the uh planning community
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
um most of that is all relatively um you
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
know level funded or or reduced to um to
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
meet uh budget um to meet budget
 
02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
constraints um a few specific line items
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit of an increase in in
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
class 50 uh on page 813 uh that is um
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
to address some expected
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
retirements and uh some some help in
 
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
helping transition those uh those
 
02:01:04.189 --> 02:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
vacancies um we did eliminate two
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary positions there when
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
you look at class
 
02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
59 um
 
02:01:15.310 --> 02:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise um things are relatively level
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
and um again all of these project
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
development bureaus are are multif
 
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
funded uh with some
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh either Direct Federal fund billing
 
02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
for the work that they do on on the
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
federal program or federal indirect
 
02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
funds um as well as some Turnpike
 
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
indirect revenue for um for those
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
efforts uh that that are related to the
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh Turnpike
 
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
system the next uh or code 3025 is the
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
highway design Bureau
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
um this is this if you uh look at the
 
02:01:52.589 --> 02:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
bottom there are eight View positions in
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
this or code uh we talked about the
 
02:01:58.109 --> 02:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
safety section being moved to the um to
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office this is the
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
your code where those positions came
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
from and some of those reductions um in
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
class 10 in class 60 uh and and along
 
02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
there are reflected um here as well um
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
we did if you look at class 59 uh
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
reduction uh across there we eliminated
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
seven full-time temporary positions to
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
meet budget
 
02:02:26.830 --> 02:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
targets um and at the very bottom in
 
02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
code class 405 which is the Lilac
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
program I know I heard representative
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
wer ref reference the Lilac program um
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
that is funded uh with um um with
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
revenue from the from the conservation
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
plates that come to us for this activity
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
the change here is that uh it it it we
 
02:02:49.069 --> 02:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
determined it was a better fit under our
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau of environment to put out the the
 
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
lilac program and manage the Lilac
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
program then in the Bureau of Highway
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
design so those um and in another or
 
02:03:00.669 --> 02:03:00.679 align:start position:0%
code further further on our Bureau of
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
environment that program has been moved
 
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
to that so did you say there were some
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
positions that were moved and some that
 
02:03:06.159 --> 02:03:07.709 align:start position:0%
positions that were moved and some that
were

02:03:07.709 --> 02:03:07.719 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
reduced out of that total of yes the
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
eight the eight that were reduced were
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
were just moved so those eight positions
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
were the safety positions that were
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
moved the safety section to the
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office class 59 there's a
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
substantial reduction there those uh
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
class 59 represent uh temporary
 
02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:31.109 align:start position:0%
class 59 represent uh temporary
full-time

02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
positions um that uh that represents
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
seven full-time temporary positions that
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
eliminated represent muray thank you
 
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
very much um at a higher level can you
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
just give an overview of how you
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
approach Highway design to put it in
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
base layman's terms what is left to
 
02:03:53.639 --> 02:03:56.430 align:start position:0%
base layman's terms what is left to
design

02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
design
 
02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.030 align:start position:0%
design
so

02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:00.189 --> 02:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I don't want to say what do
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
you what is left to design what what
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
they do the highways are here uh the
 
02:04:06.109 --> 02:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
entrance ramps the exit ramps they're
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
here you know all that stuff is year so
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
um how do you plan forward for
 
02:04:14.669 --> 02:04:14.679 align:start position:0%
additional Highway design sure and you
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
know where would a big part of it comes
 
02:04:18.189 --> 02:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
from the from the 10-year plan the
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
10-year plan identifies uh project needs
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh throughout throughout the department
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
based on the federal revenue those could
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
be uh resurfacing projects Highway
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
reconstruction projects brid replacement
 
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
projects um intersection Improvement
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
projects uh safety related projects so
 
02:04:39.069 --> 02:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
all of those um construction activities
 
02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
um require design work somebody to put
 
02:04:44.669 --> 02:04:44.679 align:start position:0%
um to figure out what what needs to be
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
done someone to manage the project
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
somebody to um you know put the contract
 
02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
plans together uh advertise of
 
02:04:55.470 --> 02:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
construction project uh so the highway
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
design Bureau primarily then is
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing all of that
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
design we're doing much more work with
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh with Consultants now um the
 
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
consultant cost are reflected under the
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
federal program but they the the direct
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
oversight by by the the highway design
 
02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
Personnel yeah thanks for fleshing it
 
02:05:17.549 --> 02:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
out because you know in reading that one
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
can just read it as new uh you know new
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
design projects and so thank you fill
 
02:05:22.239 --> 02:05:26.589 align:start position:0%
design projects and so thank you fill
that

02:05:26.589 --> 02:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
right and again uh this org like most of
 
02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
them are is is multi multif funded with
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
um inter agency transfers that's direct
 
02:05:39.629 --> 02:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
labor from the uh indirect and direct
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
labor from the trp bike system
 
02:05:45.629 --> 02:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
um agency indirect cost recoverables
 
02:05:48.189 --> 02:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
where we uh look for reimbursement of
 
02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
indirect costs and um you know we have
 
02:05:53.229 --> 02:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
direct direct and indirect federal funds
 
02:05:55.870 --> 02:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
budgeted here so um folks that are
 
02:05:58.510 --> 02:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
working on federal aid eligible design
 
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
design projects they uh direct Bill to
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
those Federal Federal projects and that
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
um direct billing is reflected in in in
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
line um on page 815 is our right of way
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh or 3028 those are the people
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
that uh manage all the State properties
 
02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
and and acquire all of the uh necessary
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
property rights to uh support the
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
project development process and and
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
support the uh projects that that we are
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
doing um again generally level funded uh
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
a a few um te technology um Investments
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
and some new software Associated there
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
the equipment line uh our survey section
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
uh Works under the Bureau of uh R of way
 
02:06:54.549 --> 02:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
survey instruments and stuff are are
 
02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
typically fairly expensive uh and those
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
equipment um needs are reflected in that
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
class 30
 
02:07:02.159 --> 02:07:03.950 align:start position:0%
class 30
line

02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
um again this is an area where we have
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
eliminated two um temporary full-time
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
positions to meet budget targets that's
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
in class
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
59 uh and again the estimated source of
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
funds is multif funded with um um inter
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
agency transfers agency and direct
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
direct crost recovery federal funds and
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
Highway funds bu of uh the next code 30
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
3032 is our environmental Bureau they
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
oversee all of our permitting and
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
oversee all of the um all of our uh
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Compliance for our federal
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
federal aid projects again mostly
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
generally uh level funded I had
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
referenced the Lilac program that shows
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
up here as we move that program to this
 
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh to this Bureau um and similarly
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
multif funded as well uh page 818 is the
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
bridge design Bureau um again those are
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh the folks that um design the bridge
 
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
projects and oversee our existing Bridge
 
02:08:11.069 --> 02:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
section as well as all all the um
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
inspection activities for our state
 
02:08:17.229 --> 02:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
Bridges um again generally level funded
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
a few specific line items class 38
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
technology soft Weare uh that represents
 
02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
a purchase of um of a specific um ashto
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
Weare Bridge inspection and and
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
management software uh to do our Bridge
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
load ratings and uh manage uh the bridge
 
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh inventory
 
02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:40.990 align:start position:0%
uh inventory
data

02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
um and we've also um increased uh uh
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
class uh 46 to have some specific
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
consultant help in terms of uh uh
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
supporting the bridge inspection efforts
 
02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:55.870 align:start position:0%
supporting the bridge inspection efforts
as

02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
well and again class 39 class
 
02:09:03.149 --> 02:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
59 uh those reductions again uh
 
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
represent the elimination of three
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
full-time uh temporary positions to meet
 
02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:10.510 align:start position:0%
full-time uh temporary positions to meet
budget

02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
targets um moving right along class 3034
 
02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
on page 819 that's our materials and
 
02:09:20.589 --> 02:09:20.599 align:start position:0%
research Bureau um this is an area in
 
02:09:22.549 --> 02:09:22.559 align:start position:0%
class 10 you see some of the reductions
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
this this uh organization uh or unit um
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
we unfunded three full-time positions
 
02:09:31.950 --> 02:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
here to meet budget targets so that
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
reduction is reflected there
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and that's the biggest change in that
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau um sure excuse me represent
 
02:09:45.390 --> 02:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
hacken Phillips thank you Mr chair I'm
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering where what line were you
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
looking at for the three reductions you
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
were just speaking of Class 10 okay
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
thank you which is the direct labor it
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't show as much from the FY 25
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
authorized to FY 26 but but the but the
 
02:10:00.719 --> 02:10:03.350 align:start position:0%
authorized to FY 26 but but the but the
um

02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
well I yeah I can see the the numbers
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't quite quite quite bear it out but
 
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh that was where three positions
 
02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
because you have because you also have
 
02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
in there you know like any raises that
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
people get
 
02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
um continuing on um page 821 is our uh
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
construction Bureau those are the people
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
that oversee out in the field all the
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
construction uh
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
activities um again generally um level
 
02:10:40.629 --> 02:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
level funded throughout there that's
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
another area um it does typically have a
 
02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:48.559 align:start position:0%
fairly High overtime rate in class
 
02:10:52.750 --> 02:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
18 um again most of that work is driven
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
by the contractors's project schedules
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
um construction season and in in New
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
England and New
 
02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire excuse me is typically uh 12h
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
hour days during the summer and not not
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
as much during the winter obviously so
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
um they have that budget to keep up with
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
it class 59 again um see the
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
um some um
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
27 reductions there in FY 27 that
 
02:11:30.270 --> 02:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
represent the um elimination of um three
 
02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:37.470 --> 02:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
27 um multif funded as well like the
 
02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
other project development bureaus
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
um those are the core project
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
development bureaus uh some of the other
 
02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
areas this the next uh or code 3020 on
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
page 822 3036 that's our spr uh research
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
funds spr stands for State planning and
 
02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
research there is a set aside of federal
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
funds I forget the exact percentage but
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
some small percentage of the federal
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
funds that we get are uh supposed to go
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
toward planning and research um this
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
represents the the research portion of
 
02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
of that and it's
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
primarily um
 
02:12:32.589 --> 02:12:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
funding that represents you know the the
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
the research program that we do
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
typically in coordination with UNH and
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
some of those research projects um that
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
go on through
 
02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:46.430 align:start position:0%
go on through
that

02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
um moving ahead into the uh M municipal
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
Aid categorization of our our budget um
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
so um on page
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
823 uh or 2943 that represents
 
02:13:04.589 --> 02:13:04.599 align:start position:0%
apportionment A and B uh 12% of Gross
 
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
Road toll and motor vehicle fee revenues
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
go back to the cities and towns based on
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
a statutory formula um so that
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
apportionment uh is reflected in this or
 
02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:21.629 align:start position:0%
apportionment uh is reflected in this or
unit

02:13:21.629 --> 02:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
one is by population one is byad correct
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
yep and every every year we pay those
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
out quarterly and is usually true up by
 
02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
the last the last quarterly payment of
 
02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
of of the of the year um and it's
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
actually a year and it's a year and a
 
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
AER so we're making payments based on um
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
last year's Revenue actual actual
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
revenue and the estimates come the
 
02:13:50.549 --> 02:13:50.559 align:start position:0%
estimates for Revenue come from safety
 
02:13:50.559 --> 02:13:55.629 align:start position:0%
estimates for Revenue come from safety
right

02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
the next or code
 
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
2944 that's the planning um um element
 
02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
of those spr funds that's the planning
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
funds um a lot of this goes towards
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
supporting um uh Regional planning
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
commissions and their
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
activities um um throughout there um
 
02:14:19.390 --> 02:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
some some
 
02:14:23.310 --> 02:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
specific uh funding changes in here
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
particularly class 38 technology and
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
software um an increase in that line
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
represents a a shifting in some
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance of ongoing um software
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
systems from doit Who had who had
 
02:14:42.750 --> 02:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally paid for it to uh being
 
02:14:47.549 --> 02:14:47.559 align:start position:0%
absorbed um by the spr
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
program um but a big part of that in
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
class 72 is the federal grants uh that
 
02:14:55.870 --> 02:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
goes to support the activities of the
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
nine Regional planning Commissions in
 
02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:59.470 align:start position:0%
nine Regional planning Commissions in
the

02:14:59.470 --> 02:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
state and it's 100% federally
 
02:15:07.629 --> 02:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
funded class uh uh or code 2945 which is
 
02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
the municipal Aid Federal um this or
 
02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
code represents the um federal funds
 
02:15:18.990 --> 02:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
that uh that that go towards um
 
02:15:22.589 --> 02:15:22.599 align:start position:0%
Municipal local municipal funded or
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal managed projects so there are
 
02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
a number of Grant programs through
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
Federal High uh through our federal
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
programs um that that cities and towns
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
um uh can apply for they're typically
 
02:15:39.229 --> 02:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
competitive to do projects they manage
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
the projects um with with the federal
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
funds through us um and that's what this
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
um or code represents so it's primarily
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
um in um
 
02:15:54.549 --> 02:15:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh grants to those uh Municipal managed
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
projects in class 30 class
 
02:16:01.870 --> 02:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
72 um but also some of the um inter
 
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
agency transfers out of here uh go to
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
support some of those funds uh that go
 
02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
to other um other agencies and things
 
02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:16.950 align:start position:0%
to other um other agencies and things
like

02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:20.510 --> 02:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
that and the small amount of private
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
local funds there uh that um constitutes
 
02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
the local match most of the local match
 
02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:30.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't flow through the department
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
there are uh a limited number of
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
Municipal projects that the department
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
is managing and that reflects the local
 
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
match for those
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
projects sir you're anticipating a large
 
02:16:49.309 --> 02:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
increase in Grants is that accurate to
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
972 072 72 yes and just can those funds
 
02:17:00.429 --> 02:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
so those are funds that we're getting
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
from federal government and we're
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
Distributing them to
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities we are they are for
 
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
specific projects so there are federal
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
funded programs that uh uh for um local
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
eligible projects you've applied for
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities apply for yeah
 
02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.389 --> 02:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
I presume I don't my
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
um my supposition is it's not a um this
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's there's not a uh drastic in
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
increase in federal funds going to the
 
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities we we found the
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities are are
 
02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
traditionally um
 
02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
uh they have trouble getting projects to
 
02:17:49.629 --> 02:17:49.639 align:start position:0%
completion and to ad advertising they
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
often delayed and I think it's probably
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
um in the FY 24 and the FY 25 adjusted
 
02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
authorized it it's probably the lag of
 
02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities delivering the projects
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
that result in those low lower numbers
 
02:18:07.309 --> 02:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
than an increase in federal funds in 26
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
so Senator Roy can you just give me an
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
idea as to what kind of projects this
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
would fund for local would they be
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
Bridges roads I mean anything
 
02:18:33.070 --> 02:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
dams Bridges Road so um for example in
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
the Federal in the federal um
 
02:18:38.589 --> 02:18:38.599 align:start position:0%
reauthorization bill that came out they
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
had a special Bridge fund of $45 million
 
02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
a year that came to New Hampshire
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
specifically for Bridges and in that $45
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
million was an allotment or an
 
02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:52.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use about 15% of that
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
toward what they call off system Bridges
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
which would be typically Municipal
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
Bridges so um a a big part of these LPA
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
projects come from that that Federal
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
funding so um whatever 15% of $45
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
million is $9 million a year something
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
like that about $9 million a year go
 
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
toward um uh Municipal red lless bridges
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
for example you have a long list of
 
02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
towns that have projects we do we do
 
02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
okay there are some other uh uh programs
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh Transportation Alternatives program
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
um which is a competitive grant program
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
which is typically for uh municipalities
 
02:19:39.389 --> 02:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
to uh apply for to do Trails or sidewalk
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
type of uh more smaller scale um
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
alternative transportation type of
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
projects so those are a couple of
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
examples of the um um locally managed
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
you so uh moving on to page 826 I had
 
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned fuel distribution uh code uh
 
02:20:10.830 --> 02:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
or code 4965 is the municipal fuel
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
portion of that um this is the fuel
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
purchased uh through our uh through the
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
state fuel system um that is purchased
 
02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
by municipalities schools and Etc and
 
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
the um Revenue um offsetting that or
 
02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
reference there is for is is reflected
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:32.399 --> 02:20:34.150 align:start position:0%
 
those

02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
um moving on into the next uh section we
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
get into some of the um construction
 
02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
program funds so or code 3039 is the
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
betterment program so that represents 3
 
02:20:50.429 --> 02:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
cents of the road toll that is collected
 
02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
by safety so statutorily 3 cents of the
 
02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:57.150 align:start position:0%
by safety so statutorily 3 cents of the
um

02:20:57.150 --> 02:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
22.4 Cent gas tax goes to Highway
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
betterment uh
 
02:21:08.590 --> 02:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
activities um represents uh uh about $21
 
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
million per year and um this is used for
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh you know non-federal Aid
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
um uh non-federal Aid construction work
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
on on um on State on state highways um
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
it supports some of the um construction
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
work that our districts do by by by
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
force account or or funding allotted to
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
them for small local repairs and
 
02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
improvements uh a big part of this also
 
02:21:40.030 --> 02:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
goes to our annual maintenance uh Paving
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
program to keep up with the uh Paving
 
02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
needs on the
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
roads um and the revenue is is really
 
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
sourced by for by the Department of
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:54.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:21:58.030 --> 02:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
um code 3049 is non-participating
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
construction uh this pays for non
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
participating course nonparticipating
 
02:22:05.469 --> 02:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
costs associated with federal aid
 
02:22:08.830 --> 02:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
projects um it's it's it's budgeted as
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
kind of a placeholder there are um
 
02:22:13.389 --> 02:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
certain times certain activities that
 
02:22:16.830 --> 02:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
come up uh and in a project that aren't
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
um federal aid eligible that we will
 
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
bucket them here um
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
the large the large number shown in FY
 
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
24 as an actual uh as an actual expense
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
came from uh the Conway bypass um that
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
was a project that was never built and
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
we had to pay Federal Highway back for
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
the um for the federal funds that we had
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
used to purchase property and stuff for
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
that project so that's that's the type
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
of nonparticipating work that is
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
um the next page 828 is the S SP 367
 
02:22:58.960 --> 02:22:59.910 align:start position:0%
um the next page 828 is the S SP 367
capital

02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
capital
 
02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
investment that represents the uh a
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that that represents the
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
4.2 Cent gas tax increase that was um
 
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated to um rural Paving and uh
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
Bridge work and and uh supporting The
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
Debt Service for the uh for the Tiffy
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
alone that paid for the completion of of
 
02:23:29.469 --> 02:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
i93 so it's bucketed and tracked in this
 
02:23:32.910 --> 02:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
in this or org unit and it is
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
um specifically referenced to that
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated portion of the gas tax
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
increase for this use
 
02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:45.160 align:start position:0%
um uh and the biggest huh you want me to
 
02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
pick some uh the biggest thing i' I'd
 
02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
point out is uh you know one of the
 
02:23:50.910 --> 02:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
things we're dealing with uh so for the
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
last and I think we covered this in the
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
introduction and you look at the shift
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
in in funds there particularly between
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
Debt Service uh on class 49 and uh class
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
400 construction repair materials so for
 
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
the last nine years we have been able to
 
02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
based on the structure of the loan only
 
02:24:15.269 --> 02:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
pay um interest on the loan and for the
 
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
last nine years we've been able to use
 
02:24:20.349 --> 02:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
this revenue for um local Paving and
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
Bridge projects um beginning in FY
 
02:24:28.590 --> 02:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
26 uh the um The Debt Service the we we
 
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
need to begin paying the um the
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
principal amount on that on that loan
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
hence the change um between fy2 and 26
 
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
in class
 
02:24:41.870 --> 02:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
44 and the loan the loan uh will go
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
2034 uh before it's paid
 
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
off and I lost my train of
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so but that's 1.09% that's the rate
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
rate there is a drop yeah there is a
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
drop yep so we'll be addressing that
 
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
through the through the 10-year plan
 
02:25:12.750 --> 02:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
this upcoming year but uh that that that
 
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
from the state budget is a direct
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
reflection of of of that substantial
 
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
um the next or code under the under the
 
02:25:29.230 --> 02:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh section of Consolidated federal aid
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
program is
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
3054 that that is uh the primary account
 
02:25:36.269 --> 02:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
for our cons our our our federal aid
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
Highway program this is based on the uh
 
02:25:41.630 --> 02:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
Federal Transportation bill um and the
 
02:25:43.950 --> 02:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
10-year plan funding um that's
 
02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
associated with that um this should be
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
budgeted in in in approach uh you know
 
02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
what we anticipate for federal aid um uh
 
02:25:57.870 --> 02:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway uh
 
02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:00.630 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway uh
funding

02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
um the or codes are generally uh aligned
 
02:26:08.349 --> 02:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
to support that activity and the those
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
activities the biggest or codes being um
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know class 46 which is for
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
Consultants which is a lot of our
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
engineering design work and hiring
 
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
Consultants class
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:26:23.439 --> 02:26:28.030 align:start position:0%
um uh
400

02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:31.230 --> 02:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh the payments for tipia are
 
02:26:32.429 --> 02:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
8910 and you see it in class 44 yeah
 
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
828 that that that class line 44 Debt
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
Service to other
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
agencies had 2 million Ion 2 million 23
 
02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
million yeah so in the last like I said
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
nine years we've just been paying the
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
interest on the loan and the full
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
26 yes it
 
02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
is um Mr chair can I ask a quick
 
02:27:18.670 --> 02:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
question about H Phillips um we could go
 
02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
back to the Consolidated Federal
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
um description you just provided about
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
um you know primarily being a federal
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
aid and Highway
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
program does the State of New Hampshire
 
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
leave um money on the table that we
 
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
could otherwise be eligible for because
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
of our um you know for instance like our
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
our seat belt law or you know just not
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
participating in
 
02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
in certain programs I mean is there a
 
02:27:51.230 --> 02:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
chance for us to make modest adjustments
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
to get more Federal
 
02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:54.790 align:start position:0%
to get more Federal
funding

02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
um no not really we we take great pride
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
that we that we I don't think there's
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
been a year since I've worked at the
 
02:28:04.030 --> 02:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
department for 37 years that we haven't
 
02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
fully obligated all of our available
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
federal funds every year so the seat
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
belt y Law you reference I know there is
 
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
certifications that that we do um
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
despite not having a seat belt law uh
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
there is data on voluntary usage that
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
that I know we do
 
02:28:24.269 --> 02:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
um um certify every year so that we
 
02:28:26.349 --> 02:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
aren't penalized for for federal funds
 
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
for things like that so the one area uh
 
02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
that that we don't tend to compete as
 
02:28:34.590 --> 02:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
well for has been some of the recent
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants um opportunities
 
02:28:41.269 --> 02:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
but um we have got we have got some like
 
02:28:45.269 --> 02:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
the like the um the grant to do the um
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
the seaw walls in in Northampton and Rye
 
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
but um uh that is an
 
02:28:53.389 --> 02:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
area uh but again it's highly
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
competitive as well to those
 
02:28:56.349 --> 02:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants of additional
 
02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds so there are also
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
penalties if we don't meet Our
 
02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
obligation limit so we are highly
 
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.389 --> 02:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
sure um moving ahead uh or code
 
02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
88683 that's the Garvey Debt Service
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
um happy to happy to show here that uh
 
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
our our last payment is due on 9125 and
 
02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
um we will have paid off that that
 
02:29:28.510 --> 02:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
Garvey debt so for some of you that
 
02:29:30.670 --> 02:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
don't know Garvey Debt Service
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
represents another form of financing uh
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
that we had done to um support the i93
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
Reconstruction project um it involves
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
pledging um pledging future Federal
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
Federal Aid Revenue um to to support a
 
02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh to support a loan um to build the
 
02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:56.990 align:start position:0%
uh to support a loan um to build the
project

02:29:56.990 --> 02:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:29:59.469 --> 02:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
so thank you so basically when I'm
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the combined impact of the
 
02:30:04.230 --> 02:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
8910 Deb service where the principal
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
kicks in in 26 and the Garvey where the
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
principal ends in 26 we're basically
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
getting one big hump in 26 and then more
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
or less we're just getting a $4 million
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
net increase so the pain for
 
02:30:25.389 --> 02:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
8910 kind of gets matched and offset by
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
the joy of finishing Garvey you're
 
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
exactly right the loan the tifia loan
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
was structured primarily to not
 
02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
primarily but with with the goal of
 
02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
having a
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
relatively um consistent Debt Service so
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
as the as the as the Garvey Debt Service
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
declined the the Tipp Debt Service thank
 
02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
personally I prefer declining Debt
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
Service but I'll settle for the and the
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
flattish thing so I appreciate it thank
 
02:30:55.080 --> 02:30:59.910 align:start position:0%
flattish thing so I appreciate it thank
you

02:30:59.910 --> 02:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
um so we're almost done thank you all
 
02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
for your patience hopefully this is
 
02:31:05.070 --> 02:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
helpful when you getting your questions
 
02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
answer we're on the last uh org unit on
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
page 831 which Begins the uh Turnpike
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
division the turnpike division is is
 
02:31:16.269 --> 02:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
organized a a
 
02:31:21.070 --> 02:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
little um I don't know complicated
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
a little differently yeah um but um
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
again getting back this is all primarily
 
02:31:29.590 --> 02:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds supported by the turnpike
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh toll toll Revenue so it's divided up
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
into um uh you know a number of
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
different uh or organizational units the
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
first one being 722 which is the
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
administration and support um this is uh
 
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
you know all things with the overall
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
organization and oversight of the of the
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh of the turnpike
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
system um I think the only things that
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
are that need a little bit of clarity is
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh class
 
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
29 is is where the billing for Direct
 
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
Services that are provided by Highway
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
design I mean uh Highway
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
funded units goes so places like
 
02:32:14.990 --> 02:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
Mechanical Services and Bridge
 
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance and traffic and tismo and
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
those kind of things those go those
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
expenses are shown in 29 and then in
 
02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
class 40 um those are the indirect costs
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh where the indirect costs are going so
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
we saw indirect cost revenues on the
 
02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
other side and here's the expense side
 
02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:37.590 align:start position:0%
other side and here's the expense side
of

02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
things trying that may be a some people
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
have asked that question and as we look
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
at some of the capital needs there may
 
02:32:48.190 --> 02:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
be some discussion of that coming up but
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh pardon me uh perhaps in future years
 
02:32:57.469 --> 02:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:57.479 --> 02:33:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
certainly

02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
um yep so I'm the the the individual
 
02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
class lines there there are uh a number
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
of specific items in in in those um
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
administrative lines that are um that
 
02:33:20.429 --> 02:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
are represented but um I don't know um
 
02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
drastic changes
 
02:33:27.269 --> 02:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
um within that support um the next line
 
02:33:30.830 --> 02:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
the next order code on 83 page 833 is
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
7025 which is the renewal and
 
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
replacement um this represents um work
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike system needed to keep it
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
in a state of of good repair um it's
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
based on the turnpike Capital plan um it
 
02:33:49.269 --> 02:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
represents um primarily the construction
 
02:33:49.279 --> 02:33:50.550 align:start position:0%
represents um primarily the construction
project

02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh the paving program The Bridge
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation uh things that are just
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
um um keeping the turnpike system assets
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
and good repair it does not reflect uh
 
02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
investment in new capacity or or capital
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
investment type of projects um and that
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
level of investment is is what is uh
 
02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
deemed necessary by by various studies
 
02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
to um keep up with the with the with the
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
needs the maintenance needs needs on the
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
on the TR bike system I would note uh
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know one increase in in um FY 26 in
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
class 400 construction repairing
 
02:34:34.110 --> 02:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
materials that represents you know
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
specifically a a prod do touch-up
 
02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
painting on the um on the um high level
 
02:34:44.309 --> 02:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
bridge between uh the I95 pascatore
 
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
river bridge between um New Hampshire
 
02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:48.070 align:start position:0%
river bridge between um New Hampshire
and

02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
Maine um Pap fish $10 million worth of
 
02:34:55.870 --> 02:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
paint yeah it's a big bridge I know it's
 
02:34:59.269 --> 02:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
a big bridge just a bit uh taken back
 
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
but again I trust you guys that you uh
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
calculated it correctly but still holy
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
mother of God it is it is a big project
 
02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
there are there are like I said some
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
specific projects I again that that
 
02:35:14.670 --> 02:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
Flags mostly it's a pretty even even
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
type of program but that uh you
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
know that's a type of project we don't
 
02:35:22.590 --> 02:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
we don't do every year Paving we we pave
 
02:35:24.429 --> 02:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
certain sections of the turnpike every
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
every year so it's a relatively
 
02:35:28.590 --> 02:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
consistent investment those those
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
one-offs are those on those specialty
 
02:35:33.630 --> 02:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
type of projects that that prop up do do
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
reflect in a little bit of a spike and
 
02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming the painting is needed for
 
02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance reasons not for aesthetic
 
02:35:43.469 --> 02:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
purposes exactly yeah yeah thank you no
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
we call the I we've I mean the I95
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
Bridge we call it a forever Bridge
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
because it you know we we need to
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
continue to preserve and maintain it cuz
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of replacing that bridge or
 
02:35:58.389 --> 02:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
building a new one would be you know uh
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
substantial so and we pay the full cost
 
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
or do Maine involved as
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
well um Maine would typically be in
 
02:36:09.150 --> 02:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
involved don't show up in there yet
 
02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:10.150 align:start position:0%
involved don't show up in there yet
their

02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:36:13.870 --> 02:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
revenues I believe it may depend on
 
02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:15.510 align:start position:0%
revenues I believe it may depend on
whether

02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:36:18.269 --> 02:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
um we're doing the project or they've
 
02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're doing the project so we
 
02:36:23.230 --> 02:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
may not have M main funds coming to us
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
as as as part of this um un unlike
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
unlike the like the liftbridge
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
operations you know we New Hampshire do
 
02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
that and and but it but it's split 5050
 
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
for this work this is probably just New
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's share of that work but
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
whatever contract that that gets
 
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
executed will have main share in it as
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
well it may not flow through our budget
 
02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:49.830 align:start position:0%
well it may not flow through our budget
so

02:36:49.830 --> 02:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:51.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:36:58.349 --> 02:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so um did you have a
 
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
question yes maam D Roy total curiosity
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
the turnpikes that we have are any of
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
those turnpikes privately owned the
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
roads themselves that we no no they're
 
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
not so we bought
 
02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:26.950 --> 02:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
right they might I don't know how that
 
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
happens but um so we can go through the
 
02:37:33.550 --> 02:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
rest of these relatively quickly uh
 
02:37:35.150 --> 02:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
again it's structured a little awkward
 
02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
because uh each each separate Turnpike
 
02:37:40.830 --> 02:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
the central Turnpike the blue star
 
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
Turnpike the Spalding Turnpike all have
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
separate funding lines for operation and
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance so uh org 7026 is a central
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
operations represented
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
there the cost for that code 727 is the
 
02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know is the central maintenance
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's the maintenance on the central uh
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Turnpike on page
 
02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:04.230 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Turnpike on page
834

02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
um oh yeah go ahead Daniel so one of the
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
things I want to point out is even
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
though on the on the highway side we
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
can't fund the retention incentive and
 
02:38:16.590 --> 02:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
the winter maintenance piece but on the
 
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
turnpike side those items are funded so
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
the retention incentive is is funded in
 
02:38:26.190 --> 02:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
the turnpike side as is as our increases
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:35.469 --> 02:38:35.479 align:start position:0%
equipments yes there is some transfers
 
02:38:39.150 --> 02:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
for yeah yes repres papich quick
 
02:38:41.469 --> 02:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
question if I may thank you um I'm
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the ratio between the wages
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
in line 10 and the benefits in line 60
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
and it's almost a 3 to2 between wages
 
02:38:53.550 --> 02:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
and benefits is that a bit higher than
 
02:38:56.110 --> 02:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
usual I'm just curious if that's the
 
02:38:58.510 --> 02:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
normal ratio because obviously benefits
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
are expensive especially when you talk
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
about providing health insurance to
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who doesn't have very high
 
02:39:05.670 --> 02:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
wages that tends to bring that rati show
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
up so just any thoughts on that so so
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's at least equivalent so an hour of
 
02:39:18.349 --> 02:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
labor would have at least an hour of
 
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
benefit associated with it thank
 
02:39:24.750 --> 02:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
you depends of course how much they're
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
making but in general so if I may just
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
to remind everybody all of the positions
 
02:39:32.670 --> 02:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
the permanent classified positions are
 
02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
funded at either the existing positions
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit package or if it's a
 
02:39:40.990 --> 02:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
vacant position the starting salary and
 
02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
I believe a two-person plan is assumed
 
02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
for the uh HMO benefits so all of those
 
02:39:49.389 --> 02:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
are driven by uh backup working rates
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:59.230 align:start position:0%
 
benefits

02:39:59.230 --> 02:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
um guess we can go through these one one
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
by one on page 835 72 code 727 is
 
02:40:09.150 --> 02:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
Central Central maintenance um and
 
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's a cost to maintain that and as U
 
02:40:15.070 --> 02:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
um uh Danielle pointed out we do have
 
02:40:17.469 --> 02:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
the um winter maintenance and some of
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
the other um
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh materials and stuff budgeted there um
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
we do have some for example
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
um you know additional costs reflected
 
02:40:33.389 --> 02:40:33.399 align:start position:0%
in those budgets particularly class line
 
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
400 um we're we're we're budgeting for
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
um for uh a bridge washing contract
 
02:40:44.469 --> 02:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
similarly on on on the turnpike
 
02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
system and um you know some of the other
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
contracts for op operational Services uh
 
02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
you see some increases there um some of
 
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
that is graffiti removal this is class
 
02:41:00.429 --> 02:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
103 um as well as some of the uh cleanup
 
02:41:03.670 --> 02:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
costs that we um encounter with u um
 
02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
homeless encampments within the r of
 
02:41:10.750 --> 02:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
way um and if you look at
 
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
um the agency income there is a a line
 
02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
there for uh 09 that represents the
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
patrol vehicle sponsorship so the uh
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
service Patrol vehicle that that we have
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
an agreement with I think it's Geico
 
02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
they provide uh a about 50% of that
 
02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
operating cost as part of the
 
02:41:31.359 --> 02:41:33.349 align:start position:0%
operating cost as part of the
sponsorship

02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
sponsorship
 
02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
um on the vehicle
 
02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:38.230 align:start position:0%
um on the vehicle
itself

02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
um page 836 is the Eastern New Hampshire
 
02:41:45.389 --> 02:41:45.399 align:start position:0%
blue star operations that's org
 
02:41:48.070 --> 02:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
7031 um there are some changes in class
 
02:41:50.429 --> 02:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
10 which represents some shifting around
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
of uh Staffing from from the do and
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
Rochester toll plazas uh at the end of
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
last year um over in Rochester Capital
 
02:42:01.030 --> 02:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
project went into to eliminate those
 
02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
tolls plazas make it all electronic
 
02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
tolling so some of those Personnel were
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
were shifted down to um to um to Hampton
 
02:42:13.230 --> 02:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
for example and those costs are
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
reflected in class
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
10 um but that's still part of the New
 
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire turn blue star operation
 
02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
because I don't see any changes in the
 
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
Rochester Rochester in in the Spalding
 
02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:39.150 align:start position:0%
Rochester Rochester in in the Spalding
Turn

02:42:39.150 --> 02:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:43.309 align:start position:0%
 
Pike

02:42:43.309 --> 02:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so on page 838 if you look at 7
 
02:42:49.349 --> 02:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
7036 the Eastern New Hampshire ter
 
02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
spaling turn bike operations you'll see
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
like class 10 that reduction of of some
 
02:42:56.190 --> 02:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
of those positions that are shifted and
 
02:42:57.550 --> 02:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
you see the shifting of positions
 
02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
25 um on page 837 is the Eastern New
 
02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Turnpike uh Blue Star
 
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
Maintenance um that's the maintenance of
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
I95 uh we just talked on 838 about the
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Turnpike Spalding Turnpike
 
02:43:19.710 --> 02:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
operations and Spalding Turn Pike
 
02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance um again just the cost of uh
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
operating and maintaining those
 
02:43:27.630 --> 02:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
facilities and see the position changes
 
02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:32.389 align:start position:0%
facilities and see the position changes
there

02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:32.399 --> 02:43:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
um and then on page 839 um or code
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
77050 that represents the um the toll
 
02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
collection organization called the cost
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
of doing business the to cost of um um
 
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know operating the easy path
 
02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
system and the toll collection
 
02:43:58.590 --> 02:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
um um activities there
 
02:44:01.389 --> 02:44:01.399 align:start position:0%
um again that those are the
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
general kind of dramatic we contracts
 
02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
general kind of dramatic we contracts
increased

02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:12.670 --> 02:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
102 cubic y yep okay y that just is what
 
02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
it is that's the back office system that
 
02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
handles all of the Easy Pass
 
02:44:18.319 --> 02:44:19.870 align:start position:0%
handles all of the Easy Pass
transactions

02:44:19.870 --> 02:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
and that just by contract it's going up
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
Jersey it's No Easy Pass is an inter
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
Agency Group Cupic is a is a is is the
 
02:44:41.150 --> 02:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
vendor that that operates our back
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
office system they they uh they operate
 
02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
02:44:47.230 --> 02:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh collection the customer service
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
center and things like like that the
 
02:44:49.279 --> 02:44:52.190 align:start position:0%
center and things like like that the
billing

02:44:52.190 --> 02:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah right and we have agreements
 
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
with them to collect in those
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
States the one the one U item that I
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
would point out to for example class 46
 
02:45:08.429 --> 02:45:08.439 align:start position:0%
um you see an increase from 26 27 from
 
02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
$50,000 to $800,000 that
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
represents um a new RFP for the back
 
02:45:18.550 --> 02:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
office so just we're getting toward the
 
02:45:22.190 --> 02:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
end of of of our present vendors uh
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
contract I think in 28 or 29 so we do
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
have some money budgeted there to begin
 
02:45:30.910 --> 02:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
an RFP process to look at um to to look
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
at uh a new vendor um Rob on papovich
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um just to come back to line
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
102 for a moment I hear you say that
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
it's a contract increase
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
but that is a massive increase in a
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
contract could you help us understand a
 
02:45:50.429 --> 02:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more as why such a steep
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
increase has been built in the
 
02:45:56.790 --> 02:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
contract cuz you know we are talking 6
 
02:45:58.750 --> 02:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
million more or less I mean what's a few
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
million between friends you
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
know yeah I I'll have to look I know we
 
02:46:06.190 --> 02:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
had just recently um
 
02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
um we did we did the contract extension
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
on on that on that option um I I do you
 
02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
know Dave I think the I think the
 
02:46:16.349 --> 02:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized or even the actual
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures are probably somewhat low
 
02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
low cuz I know that the contracts was
 
02:46:24.190 --> 02:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
around the $21 million a year and that
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
reflected uh um additional accounts
 
02:46:27.279 --> 02:46:28.790 align:start position:0%
reflected uh um additional accounts
additional

02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
um um cost of living and higher
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
operating costs but yeah and a a small
 
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
amount of that or a portion of that is
 
02:46:41.349 --> 02:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
related to going to all electronic
 
02:46:45.030 --> 02:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
tolling um on the Spalding turnpike so
 
02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
where we eliminated the toll booths so
 
02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:49.309 align:start position:0%
where we eliminated the toll booths so
now

02:46:49.309 --> 02:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
all of our toll collection is through
 
02:46:54.510 --> 02:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
this system so it increases the number
 
02:46:57.429 --> 02:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
of letters that they have to send out to
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
people who don't have Easy Pass
 
02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
transponders and so forth thank you
 
02:47:06.269 --> 02:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
um knowing that one of those letters
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
tends to ask for a lot of money are we
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
seeing a you know in matching increase
 
02:47:14.230 --> 02:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
in expected revenues from all those
 
02:47:15.630 --> 02:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
people who pay more I mean I know that
 
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
you have a brief period of time when you
 
02:47:19.950 --> 02:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
can pay your toll without a Hefty fee
 
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
but after that it gets pretty expensive
 
02:47:24.190 --> 02:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:27.439 align:start position:0%
so right so most of the revenue is
 
02:47:29.950 --> 02:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
predicated on the total amount which
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't been increased in in a number of
 
02:47:36.110 --> 02:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
years postage has continued to increase
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
labor has continued to increase all of
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
those are required to um send out bills
 
02:47:45.389 --> 02:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
in the mail and collect and process and
 
02:47:48.630 --> 02:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
provide that customer service understood
 
02:47:50.550 --> 02:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
and if I may ask about a slightly
 
02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
different line I was just looking at
 
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
line 020 the current
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
expenses while we are not talking about
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money it's still a
 
02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
bit of a difference between the actuals
 
02:48:05.469 --> 02:48:05.479 align:start position:0%
in 24 and the budgeted amount I just
 
02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand whether that would
 
02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
be you know a onetime blip or is it just
 
02:48:14.469 --> 02:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
the account has a bit of a room in it a
 
02:48:16.429 --> 02:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
lot of this is uh credit card processing
 
02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
fees MH that we pay and because there's
 
02:48:22.269 --> 02:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
increases in Easy Pass usage and
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
transponder usage you're going to see
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
more of that thank you so it's an
 
02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
estimate it's an estimate of that
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
increas course I appreciate it thank you
 
02:48:32.190 --> 02:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
I'm good and if I may one more thing we
 
02:48:35.070 --> 02:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
are also in the process of converting
 
02:48:38.110 --> 02:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
Bedford to all electronic tolling so
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
that will impact these future costs as
 
02:48:43.950 --> 02:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
well and also provide some savings on
 
02:48:48.070 --> 02:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
the operations of the U bedf to thank
 
02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
you trigger the toll increase and I
 
02:48:52.030 --> 02:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
guess that has to be done by the
 
02:48:54.030 --> 02:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
legislature pardon
 
02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
me will trigger the toll increase
 
02:48:59.150 --> 02:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
usually it was the amount of funds that
 
02:49:01.870 --> 02:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
were in Surplus and so on and we'd look
 
02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
at it every few years it's been quite a
 
02:49:05.790 --> 02:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
while since we increased the toll and
 
02:49:07.550 --> 02:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
obviously the costs will keep going up
 
02:49:09.950 --> 02:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
on all this stuff
 
02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:12.790 align:start position:0%
on all this stuff
yeah

02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:49:16.670 --> 02:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh what would trigger a toll increase uh
 
02:49:18.950 --> 02:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
well one one one thing I know to the the
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
toll rates are are governed by governor
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
and councel um the the the discounts are
 
02:49:27.389 --> 02:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
overseen by the registrat because years
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
ago we said you know I remember could be
 
02:49:33.309 --> 02:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
15 years ago we said why haven't you
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
increased the tolls and executive
 
02:49:37.229 --> 02:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
Council said oh we wouldn't get
 
02:49:39.630 --> 02:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
elected so we had to take it away from
 
02:49:41.469 --> 02:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
them and do it same as we did with the
 
02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
court as far as I know in statute I
 
02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
think that the toll rate is still is
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
still governed by uh governor and
 
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
Council legislature has oversight over
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
any any discounts or physical locations
 
02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
of the tolling locations and and the and
 
02:49:57.309 --> 02:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
the toll plazas at the time we increased
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
it it was okay you can't the Surplus has
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
got to be a certain amount in the fund
 
02:50:04.429 --> 02:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
and it's reducing to this and so you got
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
to go back up and incre and I know it
 
02:50:09.070 --> 02:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
would be very expensive because
 
02:50:13.469 --> 02:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
of signage and excuse me all the
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
electronic stuff that would have to be
 
02:50:18.229 --> 02:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
redone yeah well we definitely are
 
02:50:21.030 --> 02:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
seeing increases in costs um on the
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
turnpike side there is an order a
 
02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
pecking order on on expenses and that is
 
02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
debt Services first operations is next
 
02:50:33.309 --> 02:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
re uh renewal and replacement is next
 
02:50:36.349 --> 02:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
leaving Capital last and so some of the
 
02:50:39.070 --> 02:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
things that we are seeing are is the
 
02:50:40.910 --> 02:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
pushing of capital projects out so
 
02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's how you know that you're not
 
02:50:45.269 --> 02:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
quite there well I mean it's it's
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
flexible we can increase the toll it's
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
probably going to be a few million bucks
 
02:50:52.389 --> 02:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
to have a toll increase but if you bring
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
in another 20 30 million you have to do
 
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
it if that's what the costs are doing
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
and I see all these costs keep going up
 
02:51:00.070 --> 02:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
and up and
 
02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
up and we are we are having those
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
conversations right there'll be some
 
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
discussions with the 10e plan next year
 
02:51:07.389 --> 02:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
particularly some of those capital
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
projects keep getting pushed out I
 
02:51:10.469 --> 02:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
remember at one point we took it away
 
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
from the executive councel because they
 
02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
were dragging their feet and and the
 
02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
Turnpike was not meeting the requirement
 
02:51:19.990 --> 02:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
to have the a certain amount of surplus
 
02:51:24.229 --> 02:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah 2009 was the last uh that's my
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
yeah repres
 
02:51:38.469 --> 02:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
Roy how many years to pay off this
 
02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
investment that we have on all the
 
02:51:43.070 --> 02:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
electronic F
 
02:51:46.870 --> 02:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh TOS in other words we had the other
 
02:51:48.269 --> 02:51:48.279 align:start position:0%
ones we were just thrown our money in
 
02:51:48.279 --> 02:51:49.150 align:start position:0%
ones we were just thrown our money in
there

02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:51:50.990 --> 02:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
how much did it cost us and what was the
 
02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated uh Break Even point for for
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
this good question we're right at uh uh
 
02:52:00.389 --> 02:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
or code 77499 on page 840 which
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
represents the turnpike Debt Service so
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh these are the current Debt Service uh
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
payments for the um for the bonds that
 
02:52:10.510 --> 02:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
are that are outstanding so their total
 
02:52:13.469 --> 02:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
outstanding debt is about
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
$184,000 million 1884 million that was a
 
02:52:20.269 --> 02:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
good deal that would be nice yeah
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and those were three bond series uh
 
02:52:24.590 --> 02:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
first one being in
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
2009 uh it was refinanced in
 
02:52:30.630 --> 02:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
2019 uh and there was a refunding series
 
02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:31.469 align:start position:0%
2019 uh and there was a refunding series
in

02:52:31.469 --> 02:52:31.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
2022 so we are not close to paying those
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
off it'll be in the thir in the in the
 
02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
2030s OR
 
02:52:42.870 --> 02:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
2040 it's out there but I can get you I
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
had the I had those uh Bond schedules
 
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
with me but I don't think I brought them
 
02:52:51.550 --> 02:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
so I can I can get you a better answer a
 
02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:57.910 align:start position:0%
so I can I can get you a better answer a
closer

02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:00.990 --> 02:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
answer and then um I guess we can cover
 
02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
we can finish up real real quick 841 is
 
02:53:05.429 --> 02:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
um sorry where were we on so that was
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
the turnpike debt service
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
749 74.99 on page
 
02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:12.790 align:start position:0%
749 74.99 on page
840

02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
840
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
um on page 841 is uh uh code 7500 with
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
um uh blue star Memorial
 
02:53:30.110 --> 02:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
umik do you know what that is
 
02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:32.150 align:start position:0%
umik do you know what that is
for

02:53:32.150 --> 02:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:53:34.110 --> 02:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
bridge oh that's for the high level
 
02:53:35.469 --> 02:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
bridge for the that must be the
 
02:53:37.070 --> 02:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the high level Bridge
 
02:53:39.950 --> 02:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and compesi
 
02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
um I'll have to check a little bit more
 
02:53:46.870 --> 02:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
um talking about 7500 yep
 
02:53:49.469 --> 02:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
7500 I think it's a placeholder I think
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's a placeholder
 
02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:53.030 align:start position:0%
it's a placeholder
too

02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
um so most of these last few accounts
 
02:53:59.309 --> 02:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
are are are are are
 
02:54:02.030 --> 02:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
um various
 
02:54:04.990 --> 02:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
um limited activities on the turnpike
 
02:54:06.830 --> 02:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
system so
 
02:54:10.030 --> 02:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
7507 uh that those those represent the
 
02:54:12.469 --> 02:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements that that are
 
02:54:15.229 --> 02:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
budgeted along the central turnpike so
 
02:54:15.239 --> 02:54:16.750 align:start position:0%
budgeted along the central turnpike so
yes

02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I told you it was a little
 
02:54:21.030 --> 02:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
awkward the way things were organized
 
02:54:22.269 --> 02:54:22.279 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:54:26.030 --> 02:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
755 represents the
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
um you know primarily the capital
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures and work that's going on in
 
02:54:32.590 --> 02:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
the central New Hampshire
 
02:54:37.590 --> 02:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
Turnpike 751 on page 842 is um
 
02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
represents the toll collection equipment
 
02:54:42.670 --> 02:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the big costs there
 
02:54:45.710 --> 02:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
particularly um is the conversion of
 
02:54:49.870 --> 02:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
Bedford AET going forward
 
02:54:53.070 --> 02:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
um on page
 
02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:55.110 align:start position:0%
um on page
843

02:54:55.110 --> 02:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
843
 
02:54:58.429 --> 02:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
um I think these are mainly placeholder
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
accounts there was a project at one
 
02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
point to consider a new exit 10 that's
 
02:55:07.950 --> 02:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
7512 that um I I don't think is uh
 
02:55:09.710 --> 02:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
anything is happening with
 
02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
that um 7514 again represents the
 
02:55:15.750 --> 02:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements on the spaling
 
02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
turnpike most of those in Rochester to
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
area have been
 
02:55:23.790 --> 02:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
completed um so some placeholder amounts
 
02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:30.150 align:start position:0%
completed um so some placeholder amounts
there

02:55:30.150 --> 02:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
um P quick question on the spoing
 
02:55:36.030 --> 02:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
obviously seeing how we are uh finishing
 
02:55:38.590 --> 02:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
that work and taking a break yeah
 
02:55:40.830 --> 02:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
ballpark uh how much of a break do you
 
02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
think that will be until spoing will
 
02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
need uh more work just trying to
 
02:55:46.510 --> 02:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
understand like the light the the
 
02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
cyclical nature of the
 
02:55:53.950 --> 02:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
projects so I know on on previous uh uh
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
so we've done I give my my sense you
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
know on the on the Spalding turnike
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
we've taken care of the Rochester and
 
02:56:02.349 --> 02:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of investment and and
 
02:56:04.830 --> 02:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
and um redoing of the of the turnpike
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
system around around Rochester over the
 
02:56:10.830 --> 02:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
last past eight or nine years we've just
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
rebuilt the Spalding Turnpike between
 
02:56:14.670 --> 02:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
Newington and Dover and the new bridges
 
02:56:17.309 --> 02:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
over the little Bay there's a section
 
02:56:18.950 --> 02:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
there um
 
02:56:21.710 --> 02:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh from from north of dova Point Road to
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
to say um where the um all electronic
 
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
tolling project is in in
 
02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
Rochester um that
 
02:56:34.990 --> 02:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
that there are no Capital plans but I
 
02:56:36.670 --> 02:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
would say it needs to be studied and and
 
02:56:38.190 --> 02:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
looked at there's a lot of growth in the
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast Area and I know that those um
 
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
interchanges are are you know kind of
 
02:56:47.950 --> 02:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
outdated outdated uh geometry from the
 
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:56:52.190 --> 02:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
from the 1950s so thank you this helps
 
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah but there isn't I mean that that is
 
02:56:58.670 --> 02:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
one of those uh future needs uh some
 
02:57:01.030 --> 02:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
sort of study and and assessment and and
 
02:57:03.630 --> 02:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
and take it from there yeah represent D
 
02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
Roy do you have any idea when um 16 is
 
02:57:09.710 --> 02:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
going to be taken care of going up
 
02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:11.229 align:start position:0%
going to be taken care of going up
towards

02:57:11.229 --> 02:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
towards
 
02:57:14.229 --> 02:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
Conway from Rochester up because that's
 
02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
obviously it's such a
 
02:57:17.830 --> 02:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous there have been a whole there
 
02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
have been series of projects uh along
 
02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
there no expansion planned other than
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
just rebuild rebuilding and and
 
02:57:28.590 --> 02:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
reconstruction so we just did uh project
 
02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
last year um several years uh from like
 
02:57:34.229 --> 02:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
Route 28 up past Green Mountain
 
02:57:37.389 --> 02:57:37.399 align:start position:0%
Furniture we just did another project uh
 
02:57:40.630 --> 02:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
completed this year um up over the hill
 
02:57:43.150 --> 02:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
by by Shaw Road and stuff there that
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
that was more of a a reconstruction of
 
02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:46.389 align:start position:0%
that was more of a a reconstruction of
the

02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
existing uh infrastructure but no
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
planned widening I know in the Tenya
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
plan we have other projects planned to
 
02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
look at Route 16 between um alany
 
02:57:59.790 --> 02:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
Madison and into and into Conway um but
 
02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
again more um uh reconstruction of the
 
02:58:06.309 --> 02:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
existing facility maybe addressing some
 
02:58:07.710 --> 02:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
of the safety issues some of the
 
02:58:09.910 --> 02:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
intersection areas consistent shoulder
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
width but uh no wholesale um expansion
 
02:58:22.389 --> 02:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:25.790 --> 02:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and then finally on on page 844 it's
 
02:58:29.630 --> 02:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
a transponder inventory fund um this is
 
02:58:32.910 --> 02:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
just a kind of resolve revolving uh fund
 
02:58:36.630 --> 02:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
from from the revenue to buy and sell uh
 
02:58:38.150 --> 02:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
the easy paath
 
02:58:40.590 --> 02:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
transponders um we've lowered it a
 
02:58:44.550 --> 02:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
little uh in the future years uh due to
 
02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh decrease in in transponder sales um
 
02:58:48.630 --> 02:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
I I think we've we've got something like
 
02:58:56.550 --> 02:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
a 75 or 78% Market penetration so um the
 
02:58:58.910 --> 02:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
growth is is just with whatever
 
02:59:01.469 --> 02:59:01.479 align:start position:0%
population growth seems to be versus a
 
02:59:05.150 --> 02:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
whole lot of new um Easy Pass customers
 
02:59:07.950 --> 02:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
so um and the
 
02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
final or is uh uh on page 845 817
 
02:59:13.319 --> 02:59:15.349 align:start position:0%
final or is uh uh on page 845 817
compensation

02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
02:59:17.710 --> 02:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
benefits and again those are similar to
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
the other other um Highway funded ones
 
02:59:22.269 --> 02:59:22.279 align:start position:0%
those are
 
02:59:24.910 --> 02:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
um um workers comp and retirement
 
02:59:27.469 --> 02:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
pension benefit Health Plans provided by
 
02:59:35.469 --> 02:59:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:39.469 --> 02:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to the end of our
 
02:59:43.110 --> 02:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
budget well done with your
 
02:59:46.550 --> 02:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
timing um we have we have hb2 items as
 
02:59:48.229 --> 02:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
well though do you have do you have few
 
02:59:55.269 --> 02:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:58.190 --> 02:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely so we have three proposed Law
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
changes I didn't make enough
 
03:00:00.479 --> 03:00:03.590 align:start position:0%
changes I didn't make enough
copies

03:00:03.590 --> 03:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:16.950 --> 03:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
first well I started talking about this
 
03:00:26.229 --> 03:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
so we might as well talk about this so
 
03:00:28.190 --> 03:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
so we have three three proposed Law
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
changes um that we that we're trying to
 
03:00:32.750 --> 03:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
put through um I'm going to let
 
03:00:33.990 --> 03:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner talk about this one because
 
03:00:36.110 --> 03:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:00:38.950 --> 03:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
it yeah I think these were the when we
 
03:00:40.910 --> 03:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
submitted the budget there were some um
 
03:00:43.309 --> 03:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
there were some uh recommended changes
 
03:00:47.590 --> 03:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
that that we we neglected to uh fully um
 
03:00:49.469 --> 03:00:49.479 align:start position:0%
convey through uh Department of
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
administrative services so these were
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
typically things that would be
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
considered in hb2 uh in the trailer bill
 
03:00:58.750 --> 03:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
um um th this this one these are
 
03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
typically statute real rule changes that
 
03:01:05.389 --> 03:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
are um that are um you know either
 
03:01:07.630 --> 03:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
housekeeping or other thing things like
 
03:01:10.510 --> 03:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
like like that so
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
um the um additional statute here is a
 
03:01:16.429 --> 03:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:01:20.590 --> 03:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
claraty um relative to you know work
 
03:01:22.910 --> 03:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that is being done you know
 
03:01:24.710 --> 03:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
within the highway within the state
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
right of way or state owned railroad
 
03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:29.670 align:start position:0%
right of way or state owned railroad
Corridor

03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:29.680 --> 03:01:31.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:01:31.469 --> 03:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:34.269 --> 03:01:34.279 align:start position:0%
yeah you want to check you got that okay
 
03:01:36.670 --> 03:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
that was sh's proposal yeah I was trying
 
03:01:39.469 --> 03:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
to read it as we talk I'll talk about
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
mine though
 
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so um the requested
 
03:01:46.030 --> 03:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
change to RSA
 
03:01:49.469 --> 03:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
23619 obstructing water penalty is to
 
03:01:52.910 --> 03:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
add in anywhere it had um a highway at
 
03:01:54.830 --> 03:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
or state owned railroad Corridor we
 
03:01:57.469 --> 03:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
consider the railroad coordinators to be
 
03:01:59.510 --> 03:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
longitudinal and linear Transportation
 
03:02:01.790 --> 03:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
corridors just like the roadway side of
 
03:02:04.110 --> 03:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
the house would consider our highways um
 
03:02:06.870 --> 03:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
we have linear butters on both sides um
 
03:02:08.469 --> 03:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
from time to time they'll they'll change
 
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
and obstruct the flow of water that
 
03:02:12.830 --> 03:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
impacts the railroad Corridor just like
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
it could a roadway so we see scouring
 
03:02:17.229 --> 03:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
out we see dams being built we see our
 
03:02:19.710 --> 03:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
drainage being being impacted so um for
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
the for the Department for the railroad
 
03:02:23.389 --> 03:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
side of the house and for our ownership
 
03:02:26.229 --> 03:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
of um approximately 450 miles of
 
03:02:28.150 --> 03:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
railroad quds we're looking for the same
 
03:02:30.630 --> 03:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
treatment under statute that the highway
 
03:02:32.469 --> 03:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
um side has so that we can continue to
 
03:02:34.830 --> 03:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
keep our infrastructure uh in a cost-
 
03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
effective Manner well-maintained and so
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
we don't have any expensive um
 
03:02:41.190 --> 03:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
Investments of of Maintenance in the
 
03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:48.030 align:start position:0%
Investments of of Maintenance in the
future

03:02:48.030 --> 03:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:50.269 --> 03:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
uh the second
 
03:02:53.950 --> 03:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
item is an efficiency uh a rule
 
03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
change So currently the um the division
 
03:03:00.110 --> 03:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
of finance currently assigns manages and
 
03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:01.710 align:start position:0%
of finance currently assigns manages and
releases

03:03:01.710 --> 03:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
releases
 
03:03:04.790 --> 03:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
encumbrances and we do quite I'm sorry
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
did you Skip One or was she talking
 
03:03:07.790 --> 03:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
about two she was talking about the
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
first one you on are you on RSA 941 now
 
03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
no the second one there's a second one
 
03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
on that page yeah sorry I'm sorry I
 
03:03:25.150 --> 03:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
oops honestly I'm not sure how it's
 
03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
related to you because it seems to be
 
03:03:31.870 --> 03:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
lottery or whatever but I'm just trying
 
03:03:33.550 --> 03:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion what we've encountered
 
03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
between the classified and unclassified
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
positions is has been some compression
 
03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
so as some of the um some of the
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
um some of the reclassification and and
 
03:03:45.870 --> 03:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
pay raises and things that have gone
 
03:03:48.429 --> 03:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
gone gone gone forward we we found
 
03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
compression at those uh higher levels
 
03:03:53.269 --> 03:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
between um you know some senior
 
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
Administration senior Bureau
 
03:03:57.790 --> 03:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
administrators and in our um
 
03:04:00.349 --> 03:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
unclassified um directive position so
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
statute right now requires I think a
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
$1,000 um pay differential between an
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
unclassified position and any one they
 
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
supervise um we've run into cases where
 
03:04:13.830 --> 03:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's um had to continually be been
 
03:04:16.950 --> 03:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
been redone uh so so we are we're
 
03:04:20.309 --> 03:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
recommending or suggesting um a a
 
03:04:25.830 --> 03:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
different um um uh value uh to to
 
03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
promote that separation Alexis do you
 
03:04:34.190 --> 03:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
want to add to that or sure um so um we
 
03:04:36.269 --> 03:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
have five directors so these are the
 
03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions in the salary set
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
um for um with the increases uh with the
 
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
um classification
 
03:04:48.910 --> 03:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
changes um some of the administrator
 
03:04:52.790 --> 03:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
positions that report directly to the
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
directors um just in uh base wages alone
 
03:04:59.750 --> 03:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
are are making more than them um So
 
03:05:01.389 --> 03:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
currently like the commissioner said
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's at $1,000 difference there must be
 
03:05:07.870 --> 03:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
a $1,000 difference um so uh as an
 
03:05:12.349 --> 03:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
example we we have a director um who is
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
significantly lower um than her uh
 
03:05:18.550 --> 03:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
highest paid classified report so every
 
03:05:21.790 --> 03:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
time that person gets an increment we
 
03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
have to go to governor and councel again
 
03:05:26.750 --> 03:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
and ask for the difference to be added
 
03:05:30.630 --> 03:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
to that person's salary um so it's it's
 
03:05:32.349 --> 03:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
every time the classified employees get
 
03:05:35.389 --> 03:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
an increase it it continues to compress
 
03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:44.110 --> 03:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
attendance I distinctly remember once
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
upon a time in my uh many careers uh
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
having been told that uh if I want to
 
03:05:52.269 --> 03:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
switch from my job as a trainer to a
 
03:05:54.150 --> 03:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
manager I would have to take a pay cut
 
03:05:56.389 --> 03:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
cuz managers were paid less I'm just
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why we have the
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
presumption that a manager has to make
 
03:06:01.990 --> 03:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
more than anybody that reports to them
 
03:06:03.790 --> 03:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
especially with certain specialized
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
positions that are very hard to find I I
 
03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
want to show a lot of respect to the
 
03:06:10.349 --> 03:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
administrators but sometimes you just
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
got to pay the techie that does the job
 
03:06:15.269 --> 03:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
more cuz you just don't have enough of
 
03:06:16.670 --> 03:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
them so I'm just trying to understand
 
03:06:18.150 --> 03:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
where that is coming from I understand
 
03:06:19.950 --> 03:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's the current law and right now it
 
03:06:21.910 --> 03:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
creates administrative pain for you
 
03:06:23.469 --> 03:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
because you got to keep making
 
03:06:27.750 --> 03:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments M but is the Department's
 
03:06:30.750 --> 03:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
position that that you know those wage
 
03:06:32.349 --> 03:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
differentials have to be there when
 
03:06:34.229 --> 03:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
people report on a chain or is it just
 
03:06:36.750 --> 03:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
your need to comply with existing law
 
03:06:38.790 --> 03:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
that just is a something you got to
 
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
respect I think it's the need to comply
 
03:06:44.790 --> 03:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
to the existing law there's also um you
 
03:06:47.590 --> 03:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
know some some incentive and benefit to
 
03:06:50.429 --> 03:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
incentivize and and uh encourage people
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
to step up into those higher levels of
 
03:06:55.550 --> 03:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
of responsibility two that we depend on
 
03:06:58.349 --> 03:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
there's almost a a disincentive for for
 
03:07:02.110 --> 03:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
for somebody to um Step Up into a
 
03:07:05.550 --> 03:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
director's position um because of that
 
03:07:07.389 --> 03:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
compression I get that and now if we
 
03:07:09.150 --> 03:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
change the differential from the current
 
03:07:11.309 --> 03:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
statutory I understand it's 1,000 you're
 
03:07:13.870 --> 03:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
looking to change it to five I'm not
 
03:07:15.630 --> 03:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
clear how that would decrease the number
 
03:07:18.110 --> 03:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
of trips because still you have a larger
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
Gap but every time the bottom comes up
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have to move the top so right so
 
03:07:26.910 --> 03:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
for um one position in particular um in
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
our agency one of the director positions
 
03:07:31.229 --> 03:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
it needs to go through an unclassified
 
03:07:33.950 --> 03:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
reclass um because I I do believe it's
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
inappropriately uh lowly uh classified
 
03:07:40.110 --> 03:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
so we do need to go through that process
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
um with um in this current uh in the spe
 
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
specific situations we have the um both
 
03:07:51.630 --> 03:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
of the division directors and the
 
03:07:53.830 --> 03:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
employees of their direct reports have
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
been with us for a very long so they are
 
03:07:58.830 --> 03:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
both maxed
 
03:08:01.469 --> 03:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
out just say it bluntly at where they
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
can go so um anytime that now there's a
 
03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
CBA increase it's going to result in
 
03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
more so we've kind of met the cap of
 
03:08:14.429 --> 03:08:14.439 align:start position:0%
going back and forth um but anytime now
 
03:08:15.910 --> 03:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
that there's an increase across the
 
03:08:17.229 --> 03:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
board through collective bargaining or
 
03:08:19.150 --> 03:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
anything like that is the only time
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
where that we would have to go back um
 
03:08:26.830 --> 03:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
and I believe if we had the 5,000 limit
 
03:08:30.110 --> 03:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
versus the 1,000 limit it would really
 
03:08:33.469 --> 03:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
um eliminate a lot of back and forth in
 
03:08:36.070 --> 03:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
most of these situations because we're
 
03:08:38.590 --> 03:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
we're literally talking about a 4%
 
03:08:42.309 --> 03:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
increase every time so $1,000 to the
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
next step is now it has to be $1,000 but
 
03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
it's we're only asking for 700 so every
 
03:08:50.510 --> 03:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
time you're asking for a different
 
03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
amount of money um to governor and
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:59.790 --> 03:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
making so it's a suggestion of something
 
03:09:02.590 --> 03:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
that that that we had uh put forward but
 
03:09:05.190 --> 03:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
we recognize that it has you know it is
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
it is it is a it is
 
03:09:11.070 --> 03:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
a directly attributed to some issues
 
03:09:13.150 --> 03:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
that that we are having but uh certainly
 
03:09:15.790 --> 03:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
recognize that this has a
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
bigger uh SP of impact
 
03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:23.990 align:start position:0%
bigger uh SP of impact
um

03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
CH no I don't think so just changes the
 
03:09:36.670 --> 03:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
parameters the differential
 
03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:38.950 align:start position:0%
parameters the differential
yeah

03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and you're saying the detriment
 
03:09:43.150 --> 03:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
would be if we just repealed it that
 
03:09:45.670 --> 03:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
what some people wouldn't want to become
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
a director
 
03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
I I think part of the det detriment of
 
03:09:54.030 --> 03:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
of of of
 
03:09:57.469 --> 03:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
um having that that thousand Gap and and
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
where we have some Bureau administrators
 
03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
really really um kind of bumping up to
 
03:10:05.389 --> 03:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
that un unclassified level it's a
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
disincentive for for people to uh
 
03:10:09.910 --> 03:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
consider taking on those higher
 
03:10:11.670 --> 03:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
positions of responsibility I mean it's
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
not unusual in the private sector to
 
03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
have people reporting to people that
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
make less than them sure or even in
 
03:10:18.389 --> 03:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
government think about some of the
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
things we saw over the past four years
 
03:10:21.630 --> 03:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
with the highest paid employees making
 
03:10:24.630 --> 03:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
more than the president by a lot sure
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and some changes have been made in
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
in the past few years recently to um try
 
03:10:33.550 --> 03:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
to address the disincentive of taking an
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
unclassified position um because at at
 
03:10:38.590 --> 03:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
our agency anyway I've never been at
 
03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
another agency um that administrator who
 
03:10:45.190 --> 03:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
is making more than the director is
 
03:10:48.229 --> 03:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
being asked to take that director role
 
03:10:51.910 --> 03:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
so they are being asked to take a
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
decrease they're no longer earning leave
 
03:10:58.070 --> 03:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so uh one of the changes recently
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
made was you previously you had to cash
 
03:11:03.630 --> 03:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
out your leave now you get to take it
 
03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
with you it goes into a grandfathered
 
03:11:09.309 --> 03:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
bank and then you earn I believe it's
 
03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
four days of leave per year to then cash
 
03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
out when you retire um so they are and I
 
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
believe the $11,000 thing was put in
 
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
there as well um but but if you're
 
03:11:23.070 --> 03:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
asking somebody who makes 120 to now
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
take a position that only makes
 
03:11:28.110 --> 03:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
98 and not earn any leave towards their
 
03:11:30.429 --> 03:11:30.439 align:start position:0%
cash out at retirement I guess I'm
 
03:11:32.469 --> 03:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
confused as to why when you're asking
 
03:11:35.309 --> 03:11:35.319 align:start position:0%
somebody to take on a higher role you
 
03:11:38.830 --> 03:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't at that point pay pay them more
 
03:11:41.630 --> 03:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
in statute we paid what we
 
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
paid we paid what we're paid the
 
03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
directors don't have when you go to a
 
03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
classified from unclassified it's not
 
03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
you're not a different pay scale so
 
03:11:53.830 --> 03:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
there's an unclassified wage schedule
 
03:11:57.710 --> 03:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
and we're paid by Statute I believe um
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
so uh some of those uh currently do are
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than what the
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
classified employees who are played by
 
03:12:10.950 --> 03:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:13.790 --> 03:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
year is it just hitting your department
 
03:12:17.630 --> 03:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
oh no this is probably across the board
 
03:12:19.469 --> 03:12:19.479 align:start position:0%
but I'm not at another agency so I I
 
03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
don't know um you there is a list of
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
positions um and we can go by title to
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
just determine if something is a like
 
03:12:31.229 --> 03:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
position and where it is on that salary
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
schedule okay I I think the right
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
solution is if it's really a problem
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
that you would change the pay scales of
 
03:12:40.750 --> 03:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
the so you could give the person a raise
 
03:12:43.790 --> 03:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
whatever not not play a game with this
 
03:12:45.630 --> 03:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
this is just I don't understand this I
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
guess I need to understand maybe give me
 
03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
some more realistic examples some actual
 
03:12:50.429 --> 03:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
examples I can understand what's going
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
on here and where the change should
 
03:12:53.550 --> 03:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
really be made it it just doesn't seem
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative so I understand what
 
03:13:14.630 --> 03:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying I don't understand the
 
03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:18.990 align:start position:0%
you're saying I don't understand the
mechanism

03:13:18.990 --> 03:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:20.349 --> 03:13:20.359 align:start position:0%
okay so the state government and federal
 
03:13:25.150 --> 03:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
different yeah we can provide some
 
03:13:28.349 --> 03:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
additional information but it's it's
 
03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion or something that that
 
03:13:31.870 --> 03:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
we observed and it was a recommendation
 
03:13:33.790 --> 03:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
we would uh like like to make but it's
 
03:13:36.670 --> 03:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
just that a recommendation so you want
 
03:13:39.429 --> 03:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
to get to the last one have two more
 
03:13:40.870 --> 03:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:44.309 --> 03:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
Alexis So currently so this is really to
 
03:13:46.229 --> 03:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
to put something that's been a practice
 
03:13:51.229 --> 03:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
for 20 years or more um on paper because
 
03:13:54.269 --> 03:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
I can't find where the agreement is for
 
03:13:57.269 --> 03:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
this because it I've only been here 10
 
03:14:01.229 --> 03:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
years so um So currently the the
 
03:14:04.830 --> 03:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
division of finance manages all of the
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
incumbrances for do it manages all the
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
incumbrances there's about 735 items um
 
03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
we also manage all the task orders
 
03:14:16.510 --> 03:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
within those there's about 500 items um
 
03:14:18.590 --> 03:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
we have staff that that have been doing
 
03:14:20.190 --> 03:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
this we have rules that that have been
 
03:14:23.389 --> 03:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
applied to this for as long as I can
 
03:14:25.150 --> 03:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
find somebody who has
 
03:14:28.190 --> 03:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
history um but it is not in writing
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere and so the suggestion that I
 
03:14:33.070 --> 03:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
received was to come and have it added
 
03:14:35.710 --> 03:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
to law so what I'm asking for is to have
 
03:14:38.590 --> 03:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
the authority to encumber at do to
 
03:14:40.510 --> 03:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
encumber and unencumber funds for
 
03:14:42.910 --> 03:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
Approved expenditures task fors and
 
03:14:45.190 --> 03:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
items approved um once they're approved
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
at GNC which is what we're current
 
03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:50.269 align:start position:0%
at GNC which is what we're current
currently

03:14:50.269 --> 03:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
doing and then the set the next item is
 
03:14:57.150 --> 03:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
um Shelly would you like to talk about
 
03:14:57.160 --> 03:15:01.670 align:start position:0%
um Shelly would you like to talk about
the

03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so as the commissioner said we um
 
03:15:17.550 --> 03:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
the department owns
 
03:15:19.550 --> 03:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
and manages many Park and Ride Lots we
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
just have the the two that went through
 
03:15:23.189 --> 03:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
the public private partnership but other
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
than that our district forces or our
 
03:15:27.189 --> 03:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
contracted facility operators are
 
03:15:29.429 --> 03:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
responsible um for the park and ride
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
facilities we've seen uh a lot of
 
03:15:35.110 --> 03:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
abandoned vehicles being left at Park
 
03:15:38.269 --> 03:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
and Ride locations including um you know
 
03:15:40.269 --> 03:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
campers and and things that are really
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
expensive um to have to deal with we've
 
03:15:45.229 --> 03:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
seen co- companies who have actually
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
brought and left them at the direction
 
03:15:49.469 --> 03:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
of the the purported owner and and dump
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
them at Park and Ride lots and right now
 
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon the department to
 
03:15:55.389 --> 03:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
take from our limited resources
 
03:15:57.030 --> 03:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
Financial Resources to pay for this so
 
03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking for this change um
 
03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
so that the cost of the removal of the
 
03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
Campers or Vehicles would be on the toe
 
03:16:07.030 --> 03:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
toe company if they're bringing them and
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
dumping them and and putting them there
 
03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
essentially um it's it's upwards of
 
03:16:10.560 --> 03:16:11.150 align:start position:0%
essentially um it's it's upwards of
about

03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:16:14.070 --> 03:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
$5,000 in some cases for for campers to
 
03:16:21.990 --> 03:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:24.070 --> 03:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
the last item for hb2 was in the
 
03:16:26.349 --> 03:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
presentation on the last page and it was
 
03:16:27.830 --> 03:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
to add
 
03:16:31.389 --> 03:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue um it it was to add revenue for
 
03:16:34.150 --> 03:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
the P3 uh income that we're receiving
 
03:16:36.790 --> 03:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
that is not currently in the budget so
 
03:16:38.349 --> 03:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
there are two sources of revenue
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
sustainment fund revenue and Rental
 
03:16:43.110 --> 03:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
income Revenue we'd like to be able to
 
03:16:46.229 --> 03:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
budget some of that um in this budget
 
03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
and also need two dedicated funds
 
03:16:51.309 --> 03:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
because the funds are restricted uh by
 
03:16:54.429 --> 03:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
use uh the rental income is restricted
 
03:16:57.349 --> 03:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
because it was previously purchased with
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
federal funds so there's a federal
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
agreement that's tied to this on what we
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
can use the funding
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
for the sustainment fund is restricted
 
03:17:10.750 --> 03:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
to maintenance of the facilities only I
 
03:17:13.590 --> 03:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
believe yes so I'm looking for two
 
03:17:15.229 --> 03:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds to be able to put that
 
03:17:15.239 --> 03:17:23.110 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds to be able to put that
in

03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:24.510 --> 03:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
and you're saying that both those
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds are required by federal
 
03:17:29.790 --> 03:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
agreements I would say that one of them
 
03:17:33.150 --> 03:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
is is required by federal by based on
 
03:17:36.189 --> 03:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
the federal uh agreement that was made
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
because the property was purchased with
 
03:17:43.229 --> 03:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
federal funds the second one is tied to
 
03:17:47.790 --> 03:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
the agreement itself that says that the
 
03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
the the use of the funds can only be for
 
03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
a certain purpose and shell can explain
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
and I would say it's this is probably
 
03:17:57.110 --> 03:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
more of an issue with with you know
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
the the you know the state budget
 
03:18:02.590 --> 03:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
structure so you know if if if we didn't
 
03:18:03.710 --> 03:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
have these
 
03:18:06.189 --> 03:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated uh funds to keep these
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
separate to maintain this facility and
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the contract requirements These
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
funds would go to the to the highway
 
03:18:15.349 --> 03:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
fund right or unct general fund or go to
 
03:18:18.429 --> 03:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
the general fund and and just be part of
 
03:18:21.229 --> 03:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
everything so just ask we did a similar
 
03:18:23.110 --> 03:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is we structured this agreement
 
03:18:26.950 --> 03:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
very similar to how we did the uh um uh
 
03:18:30.030 --> 03:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
the the rest areas in hookit uh that's a
 
03:18:33.309 --> 03:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
long-term uh land lease for for that the
 
03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
difference is with with the turnpike
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
system being being a an Enterprise fund
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
we have control within the turnpike
 
03:18:42.150 --> 03:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
system of establishing these dedicated
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
funds to keep the um to keep the funds
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
in the venue that come in associated
 
03:18:50.510 --> 03:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
with that you know going just toward
 
03:18:52.510 --> 03:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
that facility we don't have a similar
 
03:18:54.309 --> 03:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism in the broader state
 
03:18:57.030 --> 03:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
government financial system I was just
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
asking because we are trying to decrease
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
complexity a little and this adds
 
03:19:04.469 --> 03:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
complexity so I know I hear you I had I
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with treasury about
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
this um because the agreement called for
 
03:19:12.309 --> 03:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
putting the funds in a separate bank
 
03:19:14.349 --> 03:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
account or a separate fund and earning
 
03:19:17.429 --> 03:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
interest and that's not really necessary
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
they can they can still use pooled funds
 
03:19:21.429 --> 03:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
and get the advantage of the pulled
 
03:19:24.030 --> 03:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
funds like they do now they would just
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
need to book um interest on them on a
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis right so they've agreed
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
that that's the way that they would
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
approve that what who's requiring
 
03:19:39.830 --> 03:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
this so um Deputy Commissioner Brier
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier about the the P3 project
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh because the property that the dot
 
03:19:47.189 --> 03:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
owns for do and uh the Portsmouth
 
03:19:48.630 --> 03:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
portion were bought with Federal Highway
 
03:19:51.750 --> 03:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
funds in order for the Department to do
 
03:19:55.030 --> 03:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
a P3 contract and solicitation the
 
03:19:56.429 --> 03:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
department entered into agreement with
 
03:19:57.870 --> 03:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
the Federal Highway Administration
 
03:20:00.070 --> 03:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
headquarters it's the the first one that
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're aware of in in the country to be
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
able to do um something that's Revenue
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
generating on federal property so we
 
03:20:07.710 --> 03:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
entered into an early development
 
03:20:09.469 --> 03:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
agreement that allowed for concessions
 
03:20:11.349 --> 03:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
and charge for parking so as part of
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
that Revenue generation on federally
 
03:20:15.630 --> 03:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
purchased property uh Federal Highway
 
03:20:17.790 --> 03:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
came up with restricted uses of the
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
revenue uh to be Transit supportive
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
which was the original investment in the
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
property was to support shared ride use
 
03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
activity so they've restricted what we
 
03:20:29.469 --> 03:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
can spend that revenue on so that is the
 
03:20:32.030 --> 03:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
one that is restricted by um Federal
 
03:20:33.790 --> 03:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
requirements and then the facility
 
03:20:35.469 --> 03:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
sustainment fund much like at the hooks
 
03:20:37.189 --> 03:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
at rest areas we were requiring the
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
contractor to pay into an account so
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
should they not step up under the
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
obligations of their contract and make
 
03:20:47.189 --> 03:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
um essentially safety improvements or uh
 
03:20:48.990 --> 03:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
to the facilities that we own then we
 
03:20:50.910 --> 03:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
will have a fund on which we can draw
 
03:20:52.670 --> 03:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
and we can invest the funds that they've
 
03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
paid in to make our facilities um whole
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
and safe for public use so there's no
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
requirement in that latter case the
 
03:21:01.349 --> 03:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's a contractual requirement oh
 
03:21:04.030 --> 03:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
contractual a contract that went through
 
03:21:05.309 --> 03:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
the contract went through governor and
 
03:21:07.510 --> 03:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
Council for the facility sustainment
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
fund and because it's dedicated Revenue
 
03:21:12.269 --> 03:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
coming from that contract to be invested
 
03:21:13.710 --> 03:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
in those facilities who are the parties
 
03:21:15.469 --> 03:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
to the contract the parties of the
 
03:21:16.750 --> 03:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
contract are the department
 
03:21:20.389 --> 03:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
transportation and C&amp;J what is C&amp;J and
 
03:21:23.910 --> 03:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
Portsmith uh bus Prov so jalbert leasing
 
03:21:26.790 --> 03:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
doing business as C&amp;J Bus so the bus
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
line is demanding that you no the bus
 
03:21:31.030 --> 03:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
line is paying into the facility
 
03:21:34.710 --> 03:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
sustainment fund as our 30-year Lessie
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
of the property the money comes in and
 
03:21:38.950 --> 03:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
the department and the peas Development
 
03:21:41.269 --> 03:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
Authority in the case of um Portsmith
 
03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
have control of those funds so if there
 
03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
are any safety concerns that need to be
 
03:21:48.349 --> 03:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
addressed that C&amp;J does not step up to
 
03:21:50.910 --> 03:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
do we take those revenues that were paid
 
03:21:52.910 --> 03:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
into this account and we can hire a
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
contractor to go make those improvements
 
03:21:57.389 --> 03:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
so this is just the one that's related
 
03:21:59.309 --> 03:21:59.319 align:start position:0%
to the Port Port of Development
 
03:22:01.030 --> 03:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
Authority not the other one which is not
 
03:22:03.389 --> 03:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
involving that no Dover has the same
 
03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
requirement it's just in the case of the
 
03:22:07.070 --> 03:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's two facility sustainment funds
 
03:22:09.070 --> 03:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
one for do that the department has full
 
03:22:11.229 --> 03:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
control over and there's a facility
 
03:22:13.990 --> 03:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
sustainment fund for Portsmith that both
 
03:22:16.710 --> 03:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
PDA and the department have joint one
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
first the do one that's already in place
 
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
the contract was approved by governor
 
03:22:23.830 --> 03:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
and Council in December no no I mean the
 
03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
the separate fund is already in place
 
03:22:27.030 --> 03:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that's what we're try
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to establish
 
03:22:30.790 --> 03:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
asking with three things
 
03:22:33.550 --> 03:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
here be one facility sustainment fund
 
03:22:35.070 --> 03:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
but we could we would have separate
 
03:22:36.189 --> 03:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
accounting to know how much was
 
03:22:38.389 --> 03:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated to do and how much was
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated to stick with the do one who
 
03:22:42.030 --> 03:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
are the parties of the contract the
 
03:22:43.870 --> 03:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
parties of the contract for do are the
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
state with the Department of
 
03:22:46.710 --> 03:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation being the contract
 
03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
manager in jalbert leasing doing
 
03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
business as C&amp;J Bus okay so the bus
 
03:22:54.189 --> 03:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
company demanded this part of the
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
contract negotiation when we went out to
 
03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
RFP and negotiated the contract was to
 
03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
use a similar model that we had used for
 
03:23:03.269 --> 03:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
the hooks at rest area so that the state
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
as the underlying fee simple owner would
 
03:23:08.229 --> 03:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
have access to funds should our lesie
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
not I understand what they put by
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
understand is why the state entered into
 
03:23:13.830 --> 03:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
these kinds of
 
03:23:17.830 --> 03:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
agreements we issued an RFP we we we
 
03:23:20.269 --> 03:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
solicited this this this input we put
 
03:23:22.429 --> 03:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
together the the contract to enter into
 
03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
this uh agreement right so I'm just
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why the state is
 
03:23:27.710 --> 03:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
entering is putting itself in these
 
03:23:29.550 --> 03:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
positions of requiring these dedicated
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
funds because we want to protect the we
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
want to protect the the underlying State
 
03:23:37.229 --> 03:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
asset so these are these are p3s we
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
aren't selling these outright uh uh to
 
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
to to the uh to the vendor the state is
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
retaining Pro ownership as part of this
 
03:23:49.110 --> 03:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
public private partnership we're working
 
03:23:51.150 --> 03:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
with with with the vendor on a long-term
 
03:23:55.469 --> 03:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
lease so having these maintenance um uh
 
03:24:00.429 --> 03:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:02.550 --> 03:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
Property these are owned by the state
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
correct at least this particular one is
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
y okay yeah the state owns it yes the
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
state backs it why need a dedicated fund
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
I mean this all these special dedicated
 
03:24:13.630 --> 03:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
funds are not necessary for the next 35
 
03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
years we are putting the main and
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
operation of this facility in the hands
 
03:24:22.110 --> 03:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
of a third party so protect so protect
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
so to protect the state's interest we're
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
requiring them to pay into this fund all
 
03:24:30.429 --> 03:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
right so it's our requirement it's not
 
03:24:33.189 --> 03:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
cnjs it's our requirement as part of the
 
03:24:36.590 --> 03:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
contract to uh protect the to protect
 
03:24:38.990 --> 03:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
the state uh property I get all that I
 
03:24:40.229 --> 03:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
just don't understand why the dedicated
 
03:24:42.429 --> 03:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
fund that's the only piece I'm missing
 
03:24:45.070 --> 03:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
because it's it's restricted revenue for
 
03:24:46.950 --> 03:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
a purpose I understand what I understand
 
03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
what these funds are they're not good
 
03:24:51.229 --> 03:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal management basically we don't
 
03:24:52.910 --> 03:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
really need to have a thousand as we
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
have literally probably a thousand
 
03:24:56.790 --> 03:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and we don't I don't
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
believe we have another Avenue besides
 
03:25:02.070 --> 03:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
this dedicated fund to to Full Faith and
 
03:25:05.710 --> 03:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:09.229 --> 03:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't have I I we can dig
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
into it a little bit more and provide a
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
better explanation than than we're
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
providing here but I think the the
 
03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism of collecting and retaining
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
These funds to protect the the state
 
03:25:24.269 --> 03:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
interest um I guess you're right you're
 
03:25:26.110 --> 03:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
you're not protecting the state interest
 
03:25:27.910 --> 03:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
We believe We Are We believe we're we're
 
03:25:29.469 --> 03:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
protecting the the interest in this
 
03:25:31.189 --> 03:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
facility rather than having all these
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
having these maintenance funds go to the
 
03:25:35.389 --> 03:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
General Highway fund for appropriation
 
03:25:37.710 --> 03:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
to everyone and at some point in the
 
03:25:40.269 --> 03:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
future if that default on the contract
 
03:25:43.389 --> 03:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
happens having the the whole state or or
 
03:25:45.950 --> 03:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
general fund be responsible for it we
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
want to set up this this fund to protect
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
just this facility and it holds the
 
03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:53.349 align:start position:0%
just this facility and it holds the
operator

03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
operator
 
03:25:53.359 --> 03:25:56.670 align:start position:0%
operator
accountable

03:25:56.670 --> 03:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:04.670 --> 03:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
yeah sustainment account correct that's
 
03:26:06.429 --> 03:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
correct it's a requirement it's a
 
03:26:08.110 --> 03:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
requirement as part of the contract that
 
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
we put on them to pay into this
 
03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
account no no no I think they again
 
03:26:17.670 --> 03:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
intend to be good partners there's a a
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
cap on the maximum that will be paid in
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
over time will we review that annually
 
03:26:23.710 --> 03:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
we do a facility assessment so I think
 
03:26:26.590 --> 03:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
they understood that that was part of
 
03:26:29.070 --> 03:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
the um price of doing business with the
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
state knowing that there was some risk
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
involved and this being the first time
 
03:26:34.189 --> 03:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
that we're doing this in the realm of
 
03:26:34.199 --> 03:26:36.750 align:start position:0%
that we're doing this in the realm of
public

03:26:36.750 --> 03:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:38.469 --> 03:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
transportation well we can provide a
 
03:26:40.349 --> 03:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
better briefing I I can I can see it
 
03:26:42.189 --> 03:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
it's out late in the morning and I I
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
know you're you sound frustrated
 
03:26:46.750 --> 03:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative and I don't want to uh we
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
we need to do a better job explaining it
 
03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
and if there was a uh a a mechanism that
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
that we have um W without going this
 
03:26:58.750 --> 03:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
route or establishing a dedicated fund
 
03:27:01.189 --> 03:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
um that that that would be preferable to
 
03:27:03.550 --> 03:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
us as well too and I I tried that but
 
03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
that there are no other avenues to
 
03:27:08.469 --> 03:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
restrict the revenue I was told okay
 
03:27:12.070 --> 03:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
well we can agreed the question is that
 
03:27:13.750 --> 03:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
seems to be there's no need to restrict
 
03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:19.990 --> 03:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody can explain to me why then
 
03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
but we don't don't do it now yeah
 
03:27:24.870 --> 03:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
certainly that's a good question that
 
03:27:27.070 --> 03:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
we'll get back
 
03:27:29.710 --> 03:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
to El said
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
everybody I really appreciate the
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%

apologize for the this misunderstanding
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
of the end here which I still
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
misunderstand but the presentation's
 
03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:43.840 align:start position:0%

04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
the finance division 2 meeting and this
 
04:06:33.030 --> 04:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon we have the department of
 
04:06:36.269 --> 04:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
safety with us and before we get going
 
04:06:39.070 --> 04:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm reminded that um we kind of went
 
04:06:41.550 --> 04:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
kind of slowly this morning and this one
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
apparently is even longer uh more so
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
more more time so if we look at a lot of
 
04:06:50.510 --> 04:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
if we see federal funds we maybe should
 
04:06:52.269 --> 04:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
kind of move quickly past those um
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
accounts and if we get to accounts that
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
have relatively small amounts maybe we
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
could kind of move past those accounts
 
04:06:59.149 --> 04:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
and just try to keep things moving
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
because um they got a lot to get through
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we will all get through it
 
04:07:06.510 --> 04:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
so with that um I will welcome our
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
guests from the Department of Safety and
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
ask that you introduce yourselves and uh
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Amy Newbury I'm the
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
director of administration at the
 
04:07:19.790 --> 04:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety and with me today
 
04:07:22.670 --> 04:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
is commissioner Quinn and Melanie carer
 
04:07:24.670 --> 04:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
Melanie is the deputy director of
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
administration at the department of
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
safety so I first wanted to start today
 
04:07:32.030 --> 04:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
with just going over what's in your
 
04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
pocket while I'm not going to go through
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
all of this I just wanted to explain
 
04:07:41.469 --> 04:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
what's in front of you so the first um
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
the PowerPoint um the the first item is
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
the PowerPoint now you have seen a lot
 
04:07:49.870 --> 04:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
of this before so I just wanted to point
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
out some of the changes that are in here
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
um so if I flagged a couple of pages
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to ask you to kindly look
 
04:07:59.710 --> 04:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
at the first one is page nine of the
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint so each of our seven
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
divisions have a page um where their
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
overall budget um is in this PowerPoint
 
04:08:12.109 --> 04:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
and we have updated the colors in here
 
04:08:14.670 --> 04:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
as well as a recommend ation from
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Pap papovich um so
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's easier for you to see um
 
04:08:22.870 --> 04:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is based on the governor's targets
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
um and we have met those
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
targets so the um and then of course in
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
here um I didn't change any of the if
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
you want to look at the Department's org
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
charts the division org charts the
 
04:08:37.109 --> 04:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
mission and vision and the the um you
 
04:08:38.910 --> 04:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
know what it is that we do all of that
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
in here those are on change from the
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
first presentation now the second flag
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
in here is on page 12 and that um we're
 
04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
going to talk a lot about today which um
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner will talk about in a
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
bit and that is the um Granite Shield
 
04:08:59.790 --> 04:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
Northern shield and Northern border
 
04:09:03.149 --> 04:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
Alliance I think that it's um while it's
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the budget book and we'll go through
 
04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
it I think this slide will help uh
 
04:09:10.590 --> 04:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
provide more context to these programs
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
and Define them a little bit differently
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
so I wanted just to put it in here for
 
04:09:20.189 --> 04:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
good so the second G although it's very
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
small we can certainly follow up with
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
this electronically um this is a list of
 
04:09:45.109 --> 04:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
funded vacant positions
 
04:09:49.229 --> 04:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
um this is a a working document if you
 
04:09:51.389 --> 04:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
will so have another paper copy that
 
04:09:52.349 --> 04:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
Micky I don't think I have the
 
04:09:55.229 --> 04:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
electronic version this is attached to
 
04:09:55.239 --> 04:09:57.990 align:start position:0%
electronic version this is attached to
the

04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint I don't that online oh there
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
is a PowerPoint there by that's for
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay order
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm an electronic person that's you
 
04:10:19.030 --> 04:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to send out a I will
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
forward this I will send it
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
electronically um so this is this
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
document is a um this is everchanging if
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
you will so this is only a moment in
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
time we are still advertising we are
 
04:10:36.149 --> 04:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
still filling positions so I know that
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
um for example we have on this list um
 
04:10:40.870 --> 04:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
we are filling we filled nine Trooper
 
04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
positions recently um and we are still
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
advertising and filling positions so
 
04:10:48.790 --> 04:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
this is again just a moment in time so
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
we can keep this updated if you'd like
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%

their funding source is in here as
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%

04:12:48.269 --> 04:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
Excel file is coming to you via email
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
now so you're you're getting it yeah so
 
04:12:53.429 --> 04:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
I that on me Amy the department did send
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
that to me I didn't realize it was going
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
to be part of their presentation to so
 
04:12:59.790 --> 04:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:03.630 --> 04:13:03.640 align:start position:0%
fault okay so moving on the next page is
 
04:13:06.750 --> 04:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
the next document in your pocket is a um
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
summary of these are
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
um these are pro programs within the
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
budget book the page number is on listed
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
on here as well most of these are
 
04:13:21.750 --> 04:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
federal um accounting units and a
 
04:13:24.830 --> 04:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
description of um what that program is
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
as well as the RSA that um that um
 
04:13:31.149 --> 04:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
supports that initiative and so I
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
thought that given how many we have 134
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
accounting units and I thought to get
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
through the budget book this would help
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
support information regarding the
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds and what programs we have
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
so it would give you a resource
 
04:13:50.189 --> 04:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
later cuity was this already part of
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
your slide deck or is this a separate
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
thing no this is new and I did not send
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
this on yet so I will do that we just
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
put this together great you just send
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
the PDF any have that that's fine not
 
04:14:03.630 --> 04:14:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:22.510 --> 04:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
okay so jumping into the budget
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
book so Department of Safety we start on
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
page 339 it's the bottom of the page
 
04:14:32.910 --> 04:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
there's no data on that
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
so as you go when you make references to
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
page numbers and all could you also
 
04:14:47.469 --> 04:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
provide me account numbers because I'm
 
04:14:48.510 --> 04:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
looking at this in a different way than
 
04:14:48.520 --> 04:14:49.429 align:start position:0%
looking at this in a different way than
you

04:14:49.429 --> 04:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
are it's 11:23 I me I figure that one
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
out but okay yes absolutely um so and
 
04:14:58.710 --> 04:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
stop and correct me if you want me to
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
explain more on these how we approach
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
this is really looking for changes of
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
10% um on either direction um to get
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
through this but if you want specific
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
information on anyone line just ask okay
 
04:15:13.109 --> 04:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
but that's how I'll go through this that
 
04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
sounds great okay perfect that'll keep
 
04:15:15.199 --> 04:15:15.990 align:start position:0%
sounds great okay perfect that'll keep
it

04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
moving yeah so on on this page um so
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
just quickly for reference so the this
 
04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
is the office of the commissioner um
 
04:15:28.750 --> 04:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
with a 20.4 million um stop for fiscal
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
year 26 in 20.6 million for fiscal year
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
27 37% of this is allocated to salary
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
and benefits and um operating costs are
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
Federal grant Awards processed mostly by
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
office of Highway Safety and Homeland so
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
on um accounting uh account code 38 you
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
see the the difference of
 
04:15:57.790 --> 04:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
35,000 that is software um being
 
04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
purchased for the
 
04:16:03.149 --> 04:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
iak excuse me so are you looking at just
 
04:16:05.149 --> 04:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
account that you mentioned there
 
04:16:08.560 --> 04:16:10.990 align:start position:0%
account that you mentioned there
1123

04:16:10.990 --> 04:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
1123
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
yep and that description of 1123 is also
 
04:16:17.189 --> 04:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
on your the sheet that I handed out
 
04:16:18.189 --> 04:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
about what that but didn't you say
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
something about 24 million that's the
 
04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
overall budget for the um Commissioner's
 
04:16:27.510 --> 04:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
Office okay so you're way
 
04:16:30.349 --> 04:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
down that's at the end so the sorry the
 
04:16:31.990 --> 04:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner runs from
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
page 340 to
 
04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
348 so I'm looking at the office of
 
04:16:39.030 --> 04:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner total I still don't see 24
 
04:16:39.040 --> 04:16:44.710 align:start position:0%
commissioner total I still don't see 24
million

04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's probably for the
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
bani 348 the 26 27 toal all the
 
04:16:53.309 --> 04:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office oh okay so don't
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
don't don't do banal totals because
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
those are no no no no no you can jump
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
ahead but don't use banal totals because
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
apparently you don't put those into your
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet they're not they don't
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
appear in the spreadsheet so okay I get
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.670 --> 04:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
okay so you just going to skip that this
 
04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
this whole commissioner section because
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's not really so this is you okay that
 
04:17:15.550 --> 04:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that okay so I'm GNA so
 
04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
just let me know when you're doing that
 
04:17:19.630 --> 04:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
so I can scan quickly to the end of the
 
04:17:24.590 --> 04:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
okay all the accounts so um page 341 and
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 20 um
 
04:17:30.510 --> 04:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
2298 is Homeland Security grants that is
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
also federal funds questions on this
 
04:17:37.030 --> 04:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
page page
 
04:17:39.269 --> 04:17:39.279 align:start position:0%
342 this is
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
3082 so this is the office of the Bureau
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
of hearings um so this is out of the
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office as well um so some
 
04:17:53.790 --> 04:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:25.710 --> 04:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
so if I may just it would be easier if
 
04:18:30.750 --> 04:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
when you refer to the page we also bring
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
up that four-digit account code in this
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
case we are on page 342 on account 3082
 
04:18:37.469 --> 04:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
yes some of us navigate with page
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
numbers some of them navigate with
 
04:18:40.750 --> 04:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
accounts and this will smooth things
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
over and seriously we appreciate it
 
04:18:47.710 --> 04:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm not seeing many changes in
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
3082 um do you have any questions about
 
04:18:50.520 --> 04:18:58.109 align:start position:0%
3082 um do you have any questions about
that

04:18:58.109 --> 04:18:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.119 --> 04:19:00.510 align:start position:0%
 
account

04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:19:02.670 --> 04:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
503 same page
 
04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
342 the um the I think the largest
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
change there is in um 30 um 030 and
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's a car that's replacement car due
 
04:19:16.149 --> 04:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
to age and Miles this is a question to
 
04:19:18.429 --> 04:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
the committee um if it's under a million
 
04:19:19.950 --> 04:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
dollars of total expenses are you
 
04:19:21.790 --> 04:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable going pass it or you under
 
04:19:24.189 --> 04:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
half million dollars what
 
04:19:26.510 --> 04:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
number under a million in a rule yeah
 
04:19:29.550 --> 04:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
sure in okay there may be so un unless
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
you see a reason to stop at one of these
 
04:19:34.269 --> 04:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
because the expenses are lower than a
 
04:19:36.189 --> 04:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars maybe just like go ahead
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
and gloss right over them because a lot
 
04:19:38.590 --> 04:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
of these this this one here is like
 
04:19:43.109 --> 04:19:43.119 align:start position:0%
$400,000 or half million there 3 ,000
 
04:19:44.910 --> 04:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
and half a million
 
04:19:49.229 --> 04:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
so okay 7541 seems to be the
 
04:19:53.349 --> 04:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
no oh there it is the button was red the
 
04:20:12.670 --> 04:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
mic didn't work anyway so the only
 
04:20:13.830 --> 04:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
adustment I would suggest to what the
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
chairman is saying we want to focus on
 
04:20:17.109 --> 04:20:17.119 align:start position:0%
the larger amounts cuz for obvious
 
04:20:18.910 --> 04:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
reasons but if there is something that's
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
under the threshold that has some
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful changes please don't hesitate
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
to stop on it you know but otherwise
 
04:20:27.870 --> 04:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we can uh stuff like aerial safety
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's an important topic but
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
budget wise it doesn't seem to be a
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
significant expenditure so we can I hope
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
they won't feel insulted when we skip
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
over it pretty much okay certainly so
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm correcting that 7541 that that is
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
the office of Highway Safety that is
 
04:20:48.429 --> 04:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
another um Federal grant program so they
 
04:20:51.790 --> 04:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
um so the changes there let me see there
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
um hiring you can skip those two sorry I
 
04:20:56.910 --> 04:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
didn't see notice it was
 
04:20:56.920 --> 04:20:58.670 align:start position:0%
didn't see notice it was
Federal

04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
Federal

04:21:27.389 --> 04:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
okay can I a question yes Murray yeah um
 
04:21:30.429 --> 04:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
on my page 347 this is under the alcohol
 
04:21:33.309 --> 04:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
andair driving is that a new Grant from
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
the federal line
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
102 200,000 this year and then 200,000
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%

shoot trying to find where 743 alcohol
 
04:21:49.149 --> 04:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
impaired driving number 102 it's not a
 
04:21:50.349 --> 04:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
large amount I'm just curious to know if
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
we got a new
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
Grant I I wouldn't call them new grants
 
04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's new opportunities that you know
 
04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
take place but I would say that's just
 
04:21:59.790 --> 04:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
you know reapplying what we've done in
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%

04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
2318 but I'm not seeing a large change
 
04:22:35.880 --> 04:22:45.670 align:start position:0%
2318 but I'm not seeing a large change
here

04:22:45.670 --> 04:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%

04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of the vehicle when I was
 
04:28:10.990 --> 04:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
equipping police cruisers it was all the
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
other equipment you had to to put on
 
04:28:15.910 --> 04:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
them just to make it clear that it's not
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
just go to the lot and pay the dealer
 
04:28:20.109 --> 04:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
for a truck so thank

04:28:40.269 --> 04:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
362 uh unit 2 64 the substance of use
 
04:28:48.670 --> 04:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement section um I'm seeing some
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
pretty big changes so maybe you could
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
walk us through
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
um um specifically personnel and then
 
04:29:02.189 --> 04:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
rent leases equipment
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
replacement that's pretty much the the
 
04:29:05.790 --> 04:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
ones that Drew the most attention to me
 
04:29:06.990 --> 04:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
when we I went through this the first
 
04:29:07.000 --> 04:29:23.590 align:start position:0%
when we I went through this the first
time

04:29:23.590 --> 04:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:25.750 --> 04:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
transfers oh actually I'm sorry I have
 
04:29:28.149 --> 04:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
them um so for the Personnel the
 
04:29:34.349 --> 04:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
I have that we decrease the equipment
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
purchases and the rent but I don't have
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
the list of what equipment that um was
 
04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:03.870 --> 04:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:20.830 --> 04:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
sign of Murray is this part of your
 
04:30:22.590 --> 04:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
attempts to meet the governor's targets
 
04:30:30.670 --> 04:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay so nobody has any permits and
 
04:30:37.990 --> 04:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
2913 several probably several Pages
 
04:30:40.640 --> 04:30:46.189 align:start position:0%
2913 several probably several Pages
forward

04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
did you just tell us what that's about
 
04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
and because that sounds like a place
 
04:30:52.990 --> 04:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
where you're doing permits and Licensing
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
which would bring fees in I'm not
 
04:30:55.520 --> 04:31:00.950 align:start position:0%
which would bring fees in I'm not
mistaken

04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
yes is there a question sir can you say
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
what so what what permits what licenses
 
04:31:08.950 --> 04:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about here so that's
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
permits and Licensing that unit um
 
04:31:13.830 --> 04:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
commonly sometimes is the gun line which
 
04:31:15.790 --> 04:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
does approval for gun purchases they
 
04:31:19.389 --> 04:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
also license security guards and um Bail
 
04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
Enforcement agents and so they all the
 
04:31:23.710 --> 04:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
permits and licensing on those too
 
04:31:42.109 --> 04:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.670 --> 04:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
roban Murray are we moving to the next
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
page I was curious about the substance
 
04:31:48.910 --> 04:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
abuse enforcement the granite Shield
 
04:31:50.830 --> 04:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
what happened to 20125 why is that
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
now now it's part of HD one that's in
 
04:32:15.239 --> 04:32:25.550 align:start position:0%
now now it's part of HD one that's in
the

04:32:25.550 --> 04:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.560 --> 04:32:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
budget

04:32:33.950 --> 04:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.630 --> 04:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.640 --> 04:33:06.789 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:33:06.789 --> 04:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:33:15.869 --> 04:33:15.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
so uh the northern Shield was
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
incorporated into accounting unit um
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
3077 which is the one you were
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
questioning about um there was no 25
 
04:33:27.230 --> 04:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
budget that got built into that
 
04:33:27.240 --> 04:33:33.629 align:start position:0%
budget that got built into that
accounting

04:33:33.629 --> 04:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes so the representative
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
hacken Phillips is correct so section 70
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
Northern shield on page 42 of House Bill
 
04:33:57.390 --> 04:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
two does relate to this accounting unit
 
04:33:58.910 --> 04:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I think the department could just
 
04:34:01.949 --> 04:34:01.959 align:start position:0%
speak to the 1.8 and $1.7 million the
 
04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
source of funds where that's coming from
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
and what is kind of being proposed here
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
that page 40 section 70 so starting on
 
04:34:36.029 --> 04:34:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
SE I don't know what
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
sectioning 42 p
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
no I it's a got it sorry it's right here
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
crazy so the half million dollars that's
 
04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
being talked about in hb2 that's a
 
04:35:04.990 --> 04:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
component of what we see in the grants
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:40.429 --> 04:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
I'm on now M just came back that's very
 
04:35:40.439 --> 04:35:51.789 align:start position:0%
I'm on now M just came back that's very
strange

04:35:51.789 --> 04:35:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern is that uh if I'm
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
reading the right
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
section that there's plans to use part
 
04:36:02.789 --> 04:36:02.799 align:start position:0%
of the opioid abatement trust fund for
 
04:36:05.789 --> 04:36:05.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety purchases or
 
04:36:05.799 --> 04:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety purchases or
purposes

04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
um and my understanding was that the
 
04:36:16.349 --> 04:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement trust fun was to combat
 
04:36:20.670 --> 04:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
like I guess um you know like patient
 
04:36:22.750 --> 04:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
care essentially like to
 
04:36:27.629 --> 04:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
prevent folks for from even um you know
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
I guess from like recovery and substance
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
abuse treat treatment essentially but in
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
this case it's really just
 
04:36:38.910 --> 04:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement um and my question is
 
04:36:41.789 --> 04:36:41.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't uh division 3 be taking a look
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
change considering I I don't believe the
 
04:36:50.629 --> 04:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund in the past has been used for
 
04:36:50.639 --> 04:36:53.670 align:start position:0%
trust fund in the past has been used for
safety

04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
purposes you any thoughts or Mickey uh
 
04:36:59.590 --> 04:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
no we could ask division three for their
 
04:37:03.789 --> 04:37:03.799 align:start position:0%
comments on on this section um I I don't
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
know if the department wants to speak to
 
04:37:08.189 --> 04:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
um the intent and why that source of
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
fund is being used for this purpose I
 
04:37:12.510 --> 04:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a new the new uh
 
04:37:14.590 --> 04:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
first time we've used this for
 
04:37:15.949 --> 04:37:15.959 align:start position:0%
enforcement but I'll let the department
 
04:37:22.830 --> 04:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
that um historically this has been a
 
04:37:26.670 --> 04:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
generally funded accounting unit and
 
04:37:28.590 --> 04:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
during the governor's space it um the
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:36.039 align:start position:0%
updated um it was updated
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
um for the governor's
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
office I would just say I think this
 
04:37:45.551 --> 04:37:45.561 align:start position:0%
program is critical and um you know i'
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
defer to to policy makers on how it's
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
funded and you know I don't think I'm
 
04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak in great detail of the
 
04:37:55.629 --> 04:37:55.639 align:start position:0%
opiod de batement I understand with the
 
04:37:57.629 --> 04:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
dollars there but my goal is to just
 
04:37:59.709 --> 04:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
find the dollars to keep this program
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
running so basically I'm sorry Rob m i I
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
say I'm U I think my concern is that um
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
the money is being acred for
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement programs and not law
 
04:38:16.750 --> 04:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement programs and so there seems
 
04:38:19.629 --> 04:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
to be a shift of of the way the money is
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used um I'm fine with it
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
being appropriated but that it be used
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
for opioid abatement programs as opposed
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
to law
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think that that's would be
 
04:38:31.150 --> 04:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
my question did you and were you saying
 
04:38:32.429 --> 04:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
the governor is the one who made the
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
shift with this or it was during the
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
governor's phase yeah
 
04:38:40.510 --> 04:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
okay I still have a objection to um and
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
a substance abuse fund that is used for
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.789 --> 04:38:47.799 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think that's why I think
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
division three should weigh in on that
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
Port you know portion I it's not that
 
04:38:54.910 --> 04:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
the it's not that the activity or the
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
program is not worthy of funding it's
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
just I'm not sure this is the correct
 
04:38:57.840 --> 04:38:58.789 align:start position:0%
just I'm not sure this is the correct
funding

04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism um so I'd be willing to hear
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
their thoughts in terms of um so could
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
just make a not that Mickey and and REM
 
04:39:07.709 --> 04:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
remind me to talk to Jess and see if he
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
wants to look at that as
 
04:39:12.189 --> 04:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
well yes and I would say uh perhaps the
 
04:39:14.590 --> 04:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
department could just so 500,000 a year
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
of this appropriation would be earmarked
 
04:39:18.269 --> 04:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
for Northern Shield the remaining 1.3
 
04:39:19.750 --> 04:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
just to make sure the committee knows
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
what that would be used for too sure so
 
04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
this really is to um address the needs
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
of the entire state so what we did was
 
04:39:33.230 --> 04:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
when we looked at um currently right now
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have and I'll say you know separate
 
04:39:38.190 --> 04:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
from northern Shield the North Country
 
04:39:40.110 --> 04:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
we have um many different police
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
departments that engage in this we have
 
04:39:44.750 --> 04:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
have a total of 40 Partners to address
 
04:39:47.070 --> 04:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
the needs the emerging needs that we're
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
seeing in the North Country we um carved
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
out and I I think it's an excellent idea
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
um specific funds to support Coos
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
Grafton Carol and Sullivan counties and
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
to create a a a team up there a new team
 
04:40:04.270 --> 04:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
Northern Shield to address that and um
 
04:40:06.910 --> 04:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
and combat the um the opio issues and
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
other dangerous drugs in the North
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
country as you know working up there um
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
is is presents different challenges with
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
how hard it is to get you know police
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
officers and and resources from the
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state up there so
 
04:40:22.510 --> 04:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
this was um this was a special car vote
 
04:40:24.550 --> 04:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
for them and I will tell you that um
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
there have been significant seizures up
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
there there are issues up there the
 
04:40:30.390 --> 04:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
drugs are there so um I think this is
 
04:40:32.590 --> 04:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
going to be a new model I think it's
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
going to be better and I think in the
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
end it'll be um it'll be highly
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
impactful to addressing the needs in the
 
04:40:38.400 --> 04:40:40.230 align:start position:0%
impactful to addressing the needs in the
North

04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
North
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
country further questions on that or at
 
04:40:42.718 --> 04:40:45.070 align:start position:0%
country further questions on that or at
this

04:40:45.070 --> 04:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
point Y all right so scanning
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
ahead represent D Roy yes of course uh
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
with President Trump's announcement last
 
04:40:59.230 --> 04:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
night or back along where he's going to
 
04:41:02.110 --> 04:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
be putting tariffs on Canada for not
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
stopping the drugs coming over the
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
Border do you think that's going to make
 
04:41:07.230 --> 04:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
a difference for
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
you I couldn't comment on on I don't
 
04:41:11.910 --> 04:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
think I can comment on what might happen
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
but I will comment on today we have a
 
04:41:17.708 --> 04:41:17.718 align:start position:0%
problem today that needs to be addressed
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.310 --> 04:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
you I do have a followup done um how
 
04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
many how many um can you quantify the
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
current problem in these in particular
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
to these counties um that you coming
 
04:41:41.680 --> 04:41:43.750 align:start position:0%
to these counties um that you coming
from

04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:41:47.070 --> 04:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
Canada is there a direct link are are
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
you asking me what drugs are flowing
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
from the north down yeah you just said
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
there was a problem today so I'm just
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
wondering what qu like how to quantify
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
it I I can clear I can clear that up I
 
04:41:59.910 --> 04:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a good question um I didn't
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not speaking to the source of supply
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
of drugs but I know that there has been
 
04:42:06.430 --> 04:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
a significant Source coming from the
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
south from States outside um I can't
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
quantify how much of the drugs are
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
coming from Canada down but um they are
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
seeing fentanyl they're seeing cocaine
 
04:42:19.390 --> 04:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
they're seeing methamphetamine they're
 
04:42:21.990 --> 04:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing overdose deaths and they're
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
trying their best to work together
 
04:42:26.910 --> 04:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
amongst themselves create a North
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
Country team um so um I I would say that
 
04:42:33.390 --> 04:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
the majority of the drugs that we're
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
seeing the fenel are coming um from the
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
South but it's what you don't know what
 
04:42:40.708 --> 04:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
you also don't know is what might have
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
come over so I couldn't quantify that
 
04:42:44.270 --> 04:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
but I would say I think predominantly
 
04:42:45.550 --> 04:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
the drugs have been coming we're seeing
 
04:42:50.230 --> 04:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:53.230 --> 04:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
south so the next one where I see
 
04:42:56.350 --> 04:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
significant General funds is account
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
5412 the detective
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau and I know that I can't remember
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
your name but your wonderful
 
04:43:04.920 --> 04:43:07.390 align:start position:0%
your name but your wonderful
assistant

04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
Amy the lady at the in the white that's
 
04:43:10.878 --> 04:43:12.350 align:start position:0%
Amy the lady at the in the white that's
Amy

04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
Amy
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
were you were very good in providing
 
04:43:14.990 --> 04:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
live of information about this when I
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
met you several weeks ago and a question
 
04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
I have regarding this you move six State
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
Police from Highway to general fund and
 
04:43:26.470 --> 04:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
it made sense to me what you're doing
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
there or what the governor was doing
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
don't sorry I can't go the wrong way the
 
04:43:37.510 --> 04:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
other way
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:54.110 --> 04:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
what's the page number 384 384 3
 
04:43:54.120 --> 04:44:00.470 align:start position:0%
what's the page number 384 384 3
sorry

04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's Department of Transportation thank
 
04:44:06.270 --> 04:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
you and what was the question
 
04:44:07.470 --> 04:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative Earth okay I haven't
 
04:44:10.750 --> 04:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
gotten to that but here it is okay okay
 
04:44:13.230 --> 04:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
so um I understand why the governor
 
04:44:16.830 --> 04:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
moved the six positions from a highway
 
04:44:18.910 --> 04:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
fund to the general fund and from one
 
04:44:20.190 --> 04:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
detective Bureau group to another
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
detective Bureau group correct so there
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
were nine there were actually nine
 
04:44:28.350 --> 04:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
transfers okay but I believe you told me
 
04:44:30.110 --> 04:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
that was six of them were in the
 
04:44:31.590 --> 04:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
detective to detective and the other
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
three were some other yep so there so
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
State Police um wanted to they the
 
04:44:40.670 --> 04:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
transfers were made to better align the
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
um detectives to to better align the
 
04:44:44.948 --> 04:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
positions within the troop stations and
 
04:44:47.230 --> 04:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
the um detective Bureau so that's what
 
04:44:49.270 --> 04:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
happened there a decision made by the
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
state police oh so maybe my question
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
will be moo so having because it looked
 
04:44:56.510 --> 04:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
like the highway fund is
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
very uh tight on
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
budget so I thought that was one of the
 
04:45:04.708 --> 04:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
reasons that the adjustment was made no
 
04:45:07.150 --> 04:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
no it was a decision State Police made
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
to um to uh align the to better align
 
04:45:13.470 --> 04:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
the positions with the work they're
 
04:45:14.948 --> 04:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
doing in the in within the troop
 
04:45:16.590 --> 04:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
stations okay so having more money in
 
04:45:19.110 --> 04:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
the highway fund wouldn't incline you to
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
put them back there and get get them off
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
the general fund okay there are
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
detectives in the troops as well so
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's Patrol Troopers but then they
 
04:45:28.990 --> 04:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
have troop detectives within the troop
 
04:45:30.390 --> 04:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
right no I saw detectives in both I
 
04:45:31.270 --> 04:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
thought well maybe I could just shift
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
them back there and get my general funds
 
04:45:38.070 --> 04:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
no you got to do your you got you got to
 
04:45:40.638 --> 04:45:42.310 align:start position:0%
no you got to do your you got you got to
try

04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
try
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
right so that was my only question did
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any other questions
 
04:45:46.868 --> 04:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
there because that's where there's a big
 
04:45:50.110 --> 04:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
transfer an additional nine
 
04:45:54.830 --> 04:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
687 no don't the questions
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
there oh you okay you're good yeah okay
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
all right so I'll move
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
on so I guess we're done with this
 
04:46:08.590 --> 04:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
division of State Police did I miss
 
04:46:08.600 --> 04:46:12.510 align:start position:0%
division of State Police did I miss
something

04:46:12.510 --> 04:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.628 --> 04:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
that was
 
04:46:19.150 --> 04:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:24.990 --> 04:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
book so on page um 389 to 404 is
 
04:46:32.548 --> 04:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:35.110 --> 04:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
Management you'll find a in this
 
04:46:38.830 --> 04:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
division um is a lot of federal funding
 
04:46:43.230 --> 04:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:43.240 --> 04:46:48.030 align:start position:0%
 
679

04:46:48.030 --> 04:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.390 --> 04:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
no 59
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative whatever M you just call
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
me Kate can you just explain and perhaps
 
04:47:00.548 --> 04:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
it's obvious and I missed it
 
04:47:03.628 --> 04:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
empg Emergency Management man
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
performance grants performance grants
 
04:47:06.320 --> 04:47:15.830 align:start position:0%
performance grants performance grants
okay

04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.840 --> 04:47:17.070 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:47:17.070 --> 04:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
can so the purpose of this um this is
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
these are federal dollars um and it is
 
04:47:26.190 --> 04:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
to local communities for Emergency
 
04:47:28.590 --> 04:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
Management performance they provide
 
04:47:30.910 --> 04:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
technical assistance and grant funding
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
to local communities it the performance
 
04:47:35.708 --> 04:47:35.718 align:start position:0%
um grant program plays an important role
 
04:47:37.390 --> 04:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
in implementation of national
 
04:47:39.070 --> 04:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
preparedness systems by supporting
 
04:47:42.510 --> 04:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
building sustainment um and delivery of
 
04:47:44.990 --> 04:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
core capabilities essential to achieving
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
National preparedness goal and secure
 
04:47:49.470 --> 04:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
and resilient
 
04:47:51.670 --> 04:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
Nation so that act that whole activity
 
04:47:53.548 --> 04:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
is mostly federal funds other than that
 
04:47:55.948 --> 04:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
that one I raised the concern
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
about so what is the next one in the
 
04:47:58.878 --> 04:48:30.990 align:start position:0%
about so what is the next one in the
book

04:48:30.990 --> 04:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.868 --> 04:48:33.878 align:start position:0%
you have a question yeah go ahead um
 
04:48:36.830 --> 04:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
page my my page 414
 
04:48:36.840 --> 04:48:38.830 align:start position:0%
page my my page 414
under

04:48:38.830 --> 04:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I can't even find the unit it's
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of my page um 5006
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
mechanical safety is that a transfer
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
from someplace else that's a
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
transfer that's a division that's an hb2
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing with that's the oplc thing isn't
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
it oplc so that is the transfer of
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
mechanical and electrical engineers and
 
04:49:06.310 --> 04:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's a transfer of the positions
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
whose decision was that or is what's the
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
that moving the people basically from
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
oplc over to so I think safy it's really
 
04:49:25.470 --> 04:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
about aligning the work um so I I
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
believe this unit used to be with safety
 
04:49:29.948 --> 04:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you which year that was I
 
04:49:32.190 --> 04:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
think three Bs
 
04:49:34.590 --> 04:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
ago it's really aligning the work
 
04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're going back and
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay so we now in the fire safety
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
activity is that where we
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
are we skipped over desk did you have
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
any questions about death um desk it's
 
04:50:00.990 --> 04:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
the um uh Emergency Services um for like
 
04:50:03.548 --> 04:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
911 you had questions when we came La
 
04:50:03.558 --> 04:50:04.788 align:start position:0%
911 you had questions when we came La
last

04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:27.150 --> 04:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
404 yeah I am inged Mr sh can I ask a
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
couple questions of course um so I
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
assume this is the from the hb2 draft
 
04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
like the initial draft I assume this is
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
related to the section at the end what
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
is that 23 section 23 of the Department
 
04:50:42.360 --> 04:50:43.310 align:start position:0%
is that 23 section 23 of the Department
of

04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:50:47.910 --> 04:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
Safety that's correct great um yeah I do
 
04:50:50.190 --> 04:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
have some questions
 
04:50:54.510 --> 04:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
um so it appears that the radio
 
04:50:56.070 --> 04:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
communications State radio
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
communications is being enveloped and
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
expanded into the
 
04:51:05.310 --> 04:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
911 sech charge funding
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism uh maybe we could talk about
 
04:51:09.868 --> 04:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
the purpose of why that's happening and
 
04:51:18.470 --> 04:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
been so page page 63 of House Bill 2
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
Section 149 is what representative
 
04:51:29.430 --> 04:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.830 --> 04:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
to so um the notes provided by um the
 
04:51:35.110 --> 04:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
division were that um they currently
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
support the radio communication so this
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
just um
 
04:51:43.470 --> 04:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
charge um having this built into the
 
04:51:46.990 --> 04:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
statute so that it would be clear that
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
the um 911 over sees the radio
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
communication function and allows
 
04:51:53.310 --> 04:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
expenditures that state or federal funds
 
04:51:55.948 --> 04:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
for the um for the state radio system it
 
04:51:57.590 --> 04:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
would also provide the search charge
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
funds that would also be used for radio
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
communication maintenance so it's just
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
Clarity of what they currently
 
04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
do and maybe you could describe what the
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
current state radio communications
 
04:52:10.830 --> 04:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
include and how that's Rel relateded to
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
911 emergencies we have so so at at a
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
high level the Statewide radio system I
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
believe rides on 47 sites microwave
 
04:52:25.948 --> 04:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
repeaters radios towers and there's a
 
04:52:28.350 --> 04:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
loop so that's our state system there
 
04:52:31.470 --> 04:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
are other agencies that run on that with
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
which is critical for obviously Public
 
04:52:36.548 --> 04:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
Safety so the the division of emergency
 
04:52:38.070 --> 04:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
services and Communications that
 
04:52:41.788 --> 04:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
overseas 911 director Doyle two BPS so
 
04:52:44.670 --> 04:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
the calls come in to 911 and it's
 
04:52:46.270 --> 04:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that after the
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
calls come in that the um that help is
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
sent to where it's needed so that rides
 
04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
on the radio system all of those
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
employees all of that infrastructure
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
that entire Radio Network right now
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
Falls within the division of emergency
 
04:53:03.470 --> 04:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
services and Communications so the tie
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
between that and we can give you more on
 
04:53:08.670 --> 04:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
this offline the tie between that system
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
the crit critical importance of that
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
that as it ties to 911 and life safety
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
with you know providing resources and
 
04:53:17.230 --> 04:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
help I think is something that um I
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
think what they're trying to do is just
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
make sure to show the connection between
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
the two and um but we've looked at other
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
other you know agencies other states and
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
how those two are connected so your
 
04:53:30.510 --> 04:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
question is well that's one system and
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
then the other system is um is cellular
 
04:53:35.708 --> 04:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
or landline calling 911 but really the
 
04:53:39.548 --> 04:53:39.558 align:start position:0%
whole the whole um the radio system
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
Falls Within DEC the tower climbers the
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
network that it runs on and there are
 
04:53:48.548 --> 04:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
redundant capabilities within there that
 
04:53:51.390 --> 04:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
benefit um benefit both
 
04:53:53.788 --> 04:53:53.798 align:start position:0%
so it's really all under there
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative now it all falls within
 
04:53:56.040 --> 04:53:57.708 align:start position:0%
representative now it all falls within
that

04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
division does this allow the
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
911 the people taking 911 calls to then
 
04:54:06.510 --> 04:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
directly access this this other network
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
so they can well well they're actually
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
they're forwarding these calls they're
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
these calls but then the calls need to
 
04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
go to you know the dispatch centers the
 
04:54:17.310 --> 04:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
fire wherever and then right so is this
 
04:54:19.150 --> 04:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
helping are you tying the network
 
04:54:20.830 --> 04:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
together so the 911 people can directly
 
04:54:22.190 --> 04:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
communicate with the police or other
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services I I I think you can
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
say that but to be technical of how it's
 
04:54:29.070 --> 04:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
done I would like to provide that to you
 
04:54:32.590 --> 04:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay as opposed to just um saying
 
04:54:34.590 --> 04:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
yes I think we can provide the
 
04:54:36.150 --> 04:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
information that you're looking for
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
there are two separate systems but it is
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat complicated but I believe
 
04:54:44.150 --> 04:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
that they um with without both working
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
together the system doesn't
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
work when you say work together well
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
well well I say working working
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
functioning but you need a radio network
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
you need a radio system so that you can
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
send the First Responders and they can
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
communicate right but you also need to
 
04:55:01.948 --> 04:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
have the 911 people have access to that
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
system correct absolutely okay and
 
04:55:05.350 --> 04:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's what you'll confirm for us well
 
04:55:07.190 --> 04:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes but they're not they're not they
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't have access to a radio system
 
04:55:11.548 --> 04:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
they're not disat batching from 911
 
04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're forwarding calls to back to her
 
04:55:19.390 --> 04:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
question sure represent D so I know one
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the problems that we're having in
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
straford County up straford county is
 
04:55:24.990 --> 04:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't have cell phone coverage
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have towers and our police are
 
04:55:28.830 --> 04:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
having a hard time when they're going
 
04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
over to Middleton and other places are
 
04:55:32.948 --> 04:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
you finding that throughout New
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially up north that it's
 
04:55:37.830 --> 04:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to communicate yeah so so
 
04:55:40.470 --> 04:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
again we have um there are separate
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
systems throughout the state you know
 
04:55:44.270 --> 04:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
there's County systems it's our state
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
system which we just talk about um um we
 
04:55:50.270 --> 04:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
call it what used to be btop uh Knick
 
04:55:54.430 --> 04:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
neck so it's our system we we have cores
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
in that system our radio system that
 
04:56:00.990 --> 04:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
allows the counties to communicate to to
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
tie into that so it expands
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
interoperability so when you use the
 
04:56:07.270 --> 04:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
word interoperability that means
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
different things to different people but
 
04:56:11.868 --> 04:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
um our nwor does expand and we want to
 
04:56:14.548 --> 04:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
make sure that um some are self-reliant
 
04:56:16.548 --> 04:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
but it's tying them all together so but
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's all it's different issues it's the
 
04:56:20.190 --> 04:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
coverage is one thing but I can't speak
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the straford county I think they have
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
a they have a very good Dispatch Center
 
04:56:26.110 --> 04:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
straford County so um you know they
 
04:56:29.948 --> 04:56:29.958 align:start position:0%
would dispatch for um you know I
 
04:56:31.750 --> 04:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you who dispatches for DOA
 
04:56:34.310 --> 04:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
who dispatches for for you know I know
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.708 --> 04:56:41.718 align:start position:0%
though I have a follow of course so um
 
04:56:44.270 --> 04:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you could describe what state
 
04:56:47.230 --> 04:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
radio communication systems are who uses
 
04:56:49.190 --> 04:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
it and
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
um is there a chance that State Radio
 
04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
communication systems do not include 911
 
04:56:54.798 --> 04:56:56.510 align:start position:0%
communication systems do not include 911
emergency

04:56:56.510 --> 04:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:56:58.990 --> 04:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
requirements do not include do you mean
 
04:57:01.548 --> 04:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
do not include in what respect funding
 
04:57:04.110 --> 04:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
or policy or when you say do not include
 
04:57:06.990 --> 04:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
if you so you're currently it appears
 
04:57:10.750 --> 04:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
that the governor's proposal in hb2 is
 
04:57:13.310 --> 04:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
to pay for State Radio communication
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
systems by 911 emergency funds and my
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
question isops I missed who's using the
 
04:57:21.868 --> 04:57:21.878 align:start position:0%
state radio communications system and
 
04:57:24.150 --> 04:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
does that Communications radio system
 
04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
have requirements that do not include
 
04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
911 emergencies sure and what are these
 
04:57:30.190 --> 04:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
employees doing that will be funded out
 
04:57:33.510 --> 04:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
of those 911 funds and how do they serve
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
not only the radio network but 911 in it
 
04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
of itself because that's what you're
 
04:57:39.670 --> 04:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
looking at it's the employees it's the
 
04:57:42.430 --> 04:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
the radio technicians the tower climbers
 
04:57:44.948 --> 04:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
the equipment uh it's it's pretty much
 
04:57:46.868 --> 04:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
everything it's the entire we can we can
 
04:57:46.878 --> 04:57:49.230 align:start position:0%
everything it's the entire we can we can
provide

04:57:49.230 --> 04:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:57:51.788 --> 04:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
that I would love more information about
 
04:57:55.628 --> 04:57:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:57.510 --> 04:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah I guess you know to that
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
point it would be clearer to me since
 
04:58:01.390 --> 04:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
these are two different systems if you
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
can um identify the different revenue
 
04:58:07.150 --> 04:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
streams that go into into this
 
04:58:10.910 --> 04:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
so as as part of that I think we can do
 
04:58:12.430 --> 04:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
that now I think it's the SE charge the
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
911 SE charge so it's a 911
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
fund and so there's no funding at all
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
for the State Radio communication
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:28.030 --> 04:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
that no I think they're all on
 
04:58:30.990 --> 04:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
that we've been using the e911 funds for
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
this for years there's no change it's
 
04:58:33.948 --> 04:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
just clean
 
04:58:37.310 --> 04:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
up for how long did you say for years
 
04:58:41.990 --> 04:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:44.350 --> 04:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
four years I assume that means many or
 
04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
two we we'll we'll provide that at
 
04:58:53.440 --> 04:59:05.070 align:start position:0%
two we we'll we'll provide that at
representative

04:59:05.070 --> 04:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.470 --> 04:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
aens okay so now we up to the fire
 
04:59:11.310 --> 04:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
safety activity
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
should I forget what page that was on
 
04:59:12.638 --> 04:59:19.628 align:start position:0%
should I forget what page that was on
414

04:59:19.628 --> 04:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:23.548 --> 04:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
maybe 14
 
04:59:26.948 --> 04:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
50006 and then maybe before
 
04:59:33.990 --> 04:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
fire standards training and EMS starts
 
04:59:49.470 --> 04:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:52.350 --> 04:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
465 oh
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
so both fire standards training EMS and
 
05:00:27.190 --> 05:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
the fire Marshall's office is primarily
 
05:00:30.670 --> 05:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
funded through fees collected um by
 
05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
providing copies of Motor Vehicle
 
05:00:36.510 --> 05:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
records and certificates as authorized
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
under RSA 260 subsection 14
 
05:00:42.868 --> 05:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
and these records are typically
 
05:00:45.150 --> 05:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
requested by insurance companies and
 
05:00:47.670 --> 05:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
other authorized entities and if you
 
05:00:50.590 --> 05:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
recall the last time we were here um we
 
05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
talked about the request that um of $4
 
05:00:59.548 --> 05:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
million to be put into the um fire fund
 
05:01:02.190 --> 05:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund to support activity
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
of the fire Marshall's office this fund
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
is not healthy to support both fire
 
05:01:10.030 --> 05:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
standards training in EMS and the fire
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office so that 4 million has
 
05:01:20.270 --> 05:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
budget you'll see that on page
 
05:01:28.990 --> 05:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
6631 does it show up in revolving funds
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.270 --> 05:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
the the fire fund Appropriations appear
 
05:01:42.670 --> 05:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
as revolving funds that general fund 4
 
05:01:44.830 --> 05:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
million is a general fund appropriation
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
there is a house bill 2 Section that
 
05:01:48.430 --> 05:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
says any amount of that 400 or excuse me
 
05:01:51.868 --> 05:01:51.878 align:start position:0%
$4 million that is not expended in 26
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
won't lapse back to the general fund
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
it'll actually lapse to the fire fund so
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
all $4 million will eventually be
 
05:02:01.470 --> 05:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
benefit of the fire fund right so I
 
05:02:02.430 --> 05:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
understood all that from our previous
 
05:02:03.750 --> 05:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
conversations but where do I see the
 
05:02:07.788 --> 05:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
four million in the 65 account it's not
 
05:02:20.030 --> 05:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
oh why do I
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
is does 4065 also drw from that font I
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
have notes that tie these two together
 
05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
correct they they both pull off of um
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund the fire
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
fund okay so the dedicated fund is
 
05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
referred to as a revolving fund is that
 
05:02:57.548 --> 05:02:57.558 align:start position:0%
accurate yes okay SO3 003 is that fund
 
05:02:59.628 --> 05:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
at least as far as it as this account is
 
05:03:07.708 --> 05:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.948 --> 05:03:10.958 align:start position:0%
right so where are you all 66
 
05:03:10.958 --> 05:03:21.990 align:start position:0%
right so where are you all 66
31

05:03:21.990 --> 05:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:25.110 --> 05:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
yep the other half of it okay that's the
 
05:03:26.990 --> 05:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
other half I got
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
that I have a small question about um
 
05:03:32.788 --> 05:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
the mechanical safety unit
 
05:03:35.390 --> 05:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
5006 so I noticed there were a lot of
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
zeros in
 
05:03:41.990 --> 05:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
2024 and adjusted 2025 um it's like page
 
05:03:42.000 --> 05:03:44.270 align:start position:0%
2024 and adjusted 2025 um it's like page
414

05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
414
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
4454 and 415 excuse
 
05:03:47.360 --> 05:03:49.150 align:start position:0%
4454 and 415 excuse
me

05:03:49.150 --> 05:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:03:51.750 --> 05:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
um I guess could we have a little
 
05:03:54.990 --> 05:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
background about uh why it wasn't funded
 
05:03:58.990 --> 05:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.470 --> 05:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
now this is the one that's oh that's the
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
oplc okay okay thank 25 are accounted
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
for Inc
 
05:04:18.430 --> 05:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.910 --> 05:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm lost as of how far you guys
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
got where are youall CU you're bouncing
 
05:04:30.590 --> 05:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:38.190 --> 05:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
chotic you're Gra so where are we
 
05:04:43.350 --> 05:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
officially right now in reviewing this
 
05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
just to try to bring everybody on the
 
05:04:49.510 --> 05:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
same page cuz I'm pretty sure we are in
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
slightly different places everywhere
 
05:04:53.750 --> 05:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
across the table last question asked had
 
05:04:58.430 --> 05:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
to do with the p it was page 415 on 56
 
05:04:59.868 --> 05:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
right but previous questions were
 
05:05:02.270 --> 05:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
further down below so I'm just trying to
 
05:05:04.670 --> 05:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
figure out where we are sequentially
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
more or less
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
here I'm good just wanted to Anchor
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
all gu my question what's the next
 
05:05:30.548 --> 05:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.070 --> 05:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.430 --> 05:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
funds well well we are going down the
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
page on page 418 uh unit 6631 the fire
 
05:06:01.470 --> 05:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
safety administration we talked about
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
earlier at some point just a quick
 
05:06:06.510 --> 05:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
question on the
 
05:06:11.470 --> 05:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
um bouncy nature of the 050 line so page
 
05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
418 account 6631 line
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
050 the personal service temporary
 
05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
appointment again low number in 24 quite
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
high in 25 returning to the
 
05:06:27.548 --> 05:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
middle and while we talk about that I'm
 
05:06:29.788 --> 05:06:29.798 align:start position:0%
sure the benefits are partly related to
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
that so we could maybe talk about them
 
05:06:33.628 --> 05:06:33.638 align:start position:0%
both at the same time just trying to
 
05:06:38.150 --> 05:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
on 6
 
05:06:44.628 --> 05:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
uh yes account 6631 line is 50 and uh
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay up to the 900 60
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll have to get back with you no
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
worry I mean my best guess right now
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
would be that maybe you use less in a
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
first year and then you carry the
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted and then you budget in the
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
middle but just to be sure I don't like
 
05:07:00.910 --> 05:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
assuming I would rather be sure you know
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
so followup is amazing
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah basically it's you
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
know again it could could be that you're
 
05:07:11.910 --> 05:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
ear six something on average and you
 
05:07:13.628 --> 05:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
didn't burn it here and you are stashing
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
it here because it's a two-year budget
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and all that so that's what it looks
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.270 --> 05:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
sure if I was the 46 yeah that's what I
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
would bet
 
05:07:33.230 --> 05:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
426 because the position don't change so
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
do questional is that tempor it may not
 
05:07:37.990 --> 05:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
be in the positions you know yeah
 
05:07:39.310 --> 05:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
scooting ahead and hopefully won't go
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
back back again but I didn't have
 
05:07:42.830 --> 05:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
anything until uh the legal unit uh
 
05:07:47.230 --> 05:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
starting on it's 9002 on 427 um there's
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
the increase in Personnel looks like
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
you've hired three new people can you
 
05:07:52.868 --> 05:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
talk to the three new people you've
 
05:07:54.590 --> 05:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
hired or is this a transfer as well
 
05:07:57.390 --> 05:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
certainly we moved three positions from
 
05:08:03.628 --> 05:08:03.638 align:start position:0%
State Police so one was uh pargal um so
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
let me see one was a paralal from the
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
detective Bureau one was a a paralal
 
05:08:12.670 --> 05:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
moved from the traffic Bureau and one
 
05:08:16.708 --> 05:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
was moved from State Police
 
05:08:20.270 --> 05:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
Communications this this was done to um
 
05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
address 91a requests so these additional
 
05:08:26.150 --> 05:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
employees were needed to get placed in
 
05:08:29.070 --> 05:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
the legal unit to address a demand and
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
increase in 91a but there's it's not
 
05:08:33.788 --> 05:08:33.798 align:start position:0%
actually an increase overall in it's
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
just reassigning them to different um or
 
05:08:38.590 --> 05:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
different agency different function
 
05:08:42.708 --> 05:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.510 --> 05:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
oh sorry to bounce um page
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
419 uh unit um the expenditure total for
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
fire safety I was looking at the
 
05:08:56.948 --> 05:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
uh source of
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
funds so 48010 20 you know the fire
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
safety page
 
05:09:02.638 --> 05:09:04.190 align:start position:0%
safety page
419

05:09:04.190 --> 05:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
419
 
05:09:08.510 --> 05:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the current budget it's uh more
 
05:09:10.030 --> 05:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
other funds than very little from the
 
05:09:12.910 --> 05:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
general fund and then it flips over I
 
05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
was wondering if that's just a you know
 
05:09:16.750 --> 05:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
budgeting device for now and you expect
 
05:09:18.670 --> 05:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
that general fund number to drop or is
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
it a ongoing change in the way that uh
 
05:09:24.670 --> 05:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
unit is funded so again on page 419 the
 
05:09:26.350 --> 05:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
source of
 
05:09:30.390 --> 05:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
funds for the general fund in
 
05:09:34.670 --> 05:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh 2024 2025 it's almost all from the
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
other funds and then it becomes mostly
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
from the general fund in 26 going back
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
to mostly other funds in 27 this is
 
05:09:44.430 --> 05:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
related to the house bill 2 language
 
05:09:46.548 --> 05:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
where we're um appropriating $4 million
 
05:09:49.868 --> 05:09:49.878 align:start position:0%
General funds um into this fire fund
 
05:09:51.628 --> 05:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
okay sorry so I just missed it when it
 
05:09:53.110 --> 05:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
was covered earlier thank you for
 
05:09:56.190 --> 05:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
pointing that out I really appreciate it
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's okay I you know it's a long day
 
05:10:13.230 --> 05:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:45.070 --> 05:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:48.548 --> 05:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.470 --> 05:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
administration okay okaye I'm in the
 
05:11:11.868 --> 05:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.548 --> 05:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:20.910 --> 05:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:23.708 --> 05:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
person is the new person
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
in uh what is that account 2190 a
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:51.628 --> 05:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
account I have this one coming from it's
 
05:11:59.390 --> 05:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
transfer go ahead yes oh it sounds like
 
05:12:04.590 --> 05:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
everyone's transferring out of state
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
police it seems all the transfers you've
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
spoken to oh this they're all from State
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
Police is there a reason for
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
that well I mean quite honestly when we
 
05:12:17.788 --> 05:12:17.798 align:start position:0%
had to address the 91a I think we looked
 
05:12:19.910 --> 05:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
across the whole department to see where
 
05:12:22.350 --> 05:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
we could come up with some positions um
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
the majority of the work the majority of
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
the 91a requests come in um deal with
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
State Police um nobody wants to give
 
05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
positions up so we have to really do the
 
05:12:34.990 --> 05:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
best we can and look and see um you know
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
where we can um where we can pull them
 
05:12:39.390 --> 05:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
from so the position here it's
 
05:12:42.310 --> 05:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
transferring into Administration um is
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually really align we're trying to
 
05:12:46.750 --> 05:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
align more of the um Financial work the
 
05:12:49.470 --> 05:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
Contracting work the procurement work
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so this position within State Police
 
05:12:53.390 --> 05:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
does a lot of that work and we're
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
pulling it into Administration we're
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
doing that throughout the department
 
05:13:10.990 --> 05:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:13.390 --> 05:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
good question
 
05:13:13.400 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
good question
though

05:13:15.520 --> 05:13:15.530 align:start position:0%
though
 
05:13:15.530 --> 05:13:24.110 align:start position:0%
though
[Laughter]

05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
pleas that one doesn't seem to have too
 
05:13:26.160 --> 05:14:08.830 align:start position:0%
pleas that one doesn't seem to have too
much

05:14:08.830 --> 05:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:11.470 --> 05:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
look I asked unrelated question oh go go
 
05:14:15.868 --> 05:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
go yes sorry we're all getting swamped
 
05:14:19.548 --> 05:14:19.558 align:start position:0%
with um emails around vehicle
 
05:14:21.390 --> 05:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
registration and you know this the
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
inspections safety inspections for that
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's the bill to eliminate the safety
 
05:14:28.670 --> 05:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
inspections um some of the emails that I
 
05:14:30.628 --> 05:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
get and I mean this I'm sure we've all
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
just gotten so many of them um one of
 
05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
the issues which I would be sensitive to
 
05:14:37.350 --> 05:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
I support having the inspections frankly
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
i' like to know that the car's on on the
 
05:14:41.628 --> 05:14:41.638 align:start position:0%
road or you know in working condition um
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
especially having had a car hit me that
 
05:14:48.110 --> 05:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
was not um but one of the concerns is
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
scamming people around vehicle
 
05:14:52.708 --> 05:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
inspections and I've never even seen
 
05:14:55.070 --> 05:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
that that's it's it's not an expensive
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
thing for me to do it doesn't it takes
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
half an hour to an hour who's in charge
 
05:15:02.190 --> 05:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
of enforcing or looking into when
 
05:15:03.628 --> 05:15:03.638 align:start position:0%
someone feels they've been scammed
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
around a state inspection for their car
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
so so that that's a
 
05:15:10.750 --> 05:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I'll try and
 
05:15:13.868 --> 05:15:13.878 align:start position:0%
answer it so the inspection process in
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
and of itself um is is supported by
 
05:15:20.310 --> 05:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
rules like what is an inspection so we
 
05:15:22.230 --> 05:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh at the department of safety we
 
05:15:25.548 --> 05:15:25.558 align:start position:0%
license the um the dealers we license
 
05:15:28.708 --> 05:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
the mechanics we license those that are
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
approved to do an inspection if somebody
 
05:15:35.788 --> 05:15:35.798 align:start position:0%
does not do the required inspection and
 
05:15:38.190 --> 05:15:38.200 align:start position:0%
puts an inspection sticker on a vehicle
 
05:15:41.150 --> 05:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
and our automotive equipment inspectors
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
who work out of the DMV with Troop G
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
which is the commercial uh Troopers a
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
complaint can be filed an
 
05:15:51.230 --> 05:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
investigation's done and it could result
 
05:15:54.070 --> 05:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
in a hearing and then eventually it
 
05:15:55.868 --> 05:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
would come to my office where the person
 
05:15:57.708 --> 05:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
could be you know face some action be it
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
suspended have their license taken away
 
05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
I think your question about if they went
 
05:16:05.150 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
in I would direct you to the Attorney
 
05:16:06.990 --> 05:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
General's office with the with the
 
05:16:09.868 --> 05:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
consumer Bureau uh in other words I
 
05:16:12.750 --> 05:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't but but you could also um you
 
05:16:17.070 --> 05:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
could also steer that as well um to to
 
05:16:19.230 --> 05:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
uh I would say to the to the inspect
 
05:16:21.990 --> 05:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
inspectors because it could come down to
 
05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
not only the inflating cost but the
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
inspection itself wasn't done accurately
 
05:16:27.310 --> 05:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
so I think you have two venues there to
 
05:16:28.830 --> 05:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
look at you could look at the
 
05:16:30.830 --> 05:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement side and then the Attorney
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
General's office um for on the consumer
 
05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
issue yeah I have some sensitivity
 
05:16:38.190 --> 05:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
towards the person who's been scammed as
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
it were that their car is perfectly fine
 
05:16:43.430 --> 05:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
for passing inspection and it doesn't
 
05:16:44.830 --> 05:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
because of this because of that because
 
05:16:46.350 --> 05:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
of this and so they end up instead of
 
05:16:49.868 --> 05:16:49.878 align:start position:0%
paying $49 they pay $400 and for a lot
 
05:16:52.350 --> 05:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
of those people they don't necessarily
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
have the resources in order
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
to um address the fact that they've been
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
um taken advantage of in that way so my
 
05:17:01.868 --> 05:17:01.878 align:start position:0%
concern is more with that person who's
 
05:17:04.190 --> 05:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
been overcharged for unnecessarily
 
05:17:06.990 --> 05:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary work but once we do it um
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
aren't usually more work done it's less
 
05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
work like it has an inspection sticket
 
05:17:15.270 --> 05:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
but it didn't pass the emissions test or
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
there were issues with brakes or you
 
05:17:19.788 --> 05:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
know surface rust whatnot but there's a
 
05:17:21.868 --> 05:17:21.878 align:start position:0%
pretty um robust team so I would forward
 
05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
them I can provide you the numbers we
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
can provide the numbers to make you like
 
05:17:30.350 --> 05:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.670 --> 05:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
call so so we toward are we
 
05:17:34.680 --> 05:17:37.788 align:start position:0%
call so so we toward are we
DMV

05:17:37.788 --> 05:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:43.548 --> 05:17:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:43.558 --> 05:17:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
42

05:17:56.270 --> 05:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:03.070 --> 05:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
2926 in DMV uh account what is that
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
2311 the agenc the income is that
 
05:18:12.990 --> 05:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what your counting unit 3100
 
05:18:21.750 --> 05:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:26.030 --> 05:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
438 um it's cost cost of collections
 
05:18:31.390 --> 05:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
cost of collections oh that's right
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
which is you tell me what that is so
 
05:18:34.788 --> 05:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
just a reminder to everybody the cost of
 
05:18:36.510 --> 05:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
collections Highway fund when we hear
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
about that term here per the con tion
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
and by state law and by state budget the
 
05:18:43.990 --> 05:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety's uh road toll
 
05:18:46.868 --> 05:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
Bureau some agency indirect and then all
 
05:18:50.070 --> 05:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
basically all of DMV is funded by the
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
revenue it collects so it it deducts its
 
05:18:54.070 --> 05:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
cost of collecting and administering
 
05:18:56.430 --> 05:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
Highway funds then turns over the net to
 
05:18:58.548 --> 05:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
the highway fund as unrestricted Revenue
 
05:19:00.750 --> 05:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
so when you see agency income here in
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
201311 that's essentially Highway funds
 
05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
as far as hitting the the net bottom
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
line of the highway fund and just to
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
make sure under did correctly it's
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
essentially Highway funds but it's
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
Highway funds that never actually get
 
05:19:15.628 --> 05:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
given there they will collected as
 
05:19:17.868 --> 05:19:17.878 align:start position:0%
Highway funds and retained as the cost
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
of doing business by the agency before
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
the rest of the proceedings are put in
 
05:19:23.190 --> 05:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
the highway funds so if you have your
 
05:19:25.070 --> 05:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus statements with you that we
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
talked about this morning and passed out
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
before uh sorry Melanie I'm going sneak
 
05:19:33.150 --> 05:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
under here so if you have that handy
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see that Revenue projections are
 
05:19:37.788 --> 05:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
done on a gross basis so house waying
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
means does a grow Revenue estimate for
 
05:19:41.590 --> 05:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
road toll motor vehicle fees and then
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see the line line eight on this
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
document which is the Department of
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
safety's cost of collections backs out
 
05:19:49.070 --> 05:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
of that and then the net of that is what
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:58.548 --> 05:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
Revenue they
 
05:20:01.270 --> 05:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
just so in total just looking at this
 
05:20:05.230 --> 05:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
document in fiscal 26 about $38 million
 
05:20:06.990 --> 05:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh of cost of collections Appropriations
 
05:20:08.430 --> 05:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
are in this document that you're going
 
05:20:09.948 --> 05:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
pay my page
 
05:20:12.350 --> 05:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
through how we doing page number of
 
05:20:15.070 --> 05:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
pages versus time say that again can you
 
05:20:16.510 --> 05:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
tell where we are number of pages versus
 
05:20:18.750 --> 05:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
time you're you're on much better Pace
 
05:20:20.750 --> 05:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
than you were this
 
05:20:24.150 --> 05:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
morning good job
 
05:20:28.030 --> 05:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
team for the record we are 100 pages in
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
in one hour and a half or less and we
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
are 30 pages away from the end so you
 
05:20:35.548 --> 05:20:35.558 align:start position:0%
need to slow down and ask many
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
questions so so step St
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
up any want Toc me if need be if you
 
05:20:49.750 --> 05:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
feel Need need Okay so Motor
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
Registration is the same
 
05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
idea so this is great so this this would
 
05:20:56.868 --> 05:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
be the department where there looks like
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that people pay
 
05:21:01.230 --> 05:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
for okay good so that's what you'll be
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
telling me about
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
awesome and along with that you might
 
05:21:07.948 --> 05:21:07.958 align:start position:0%
make some if you are comfortable making
 
05:21:10.110 --> 05:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
some recommendations as
 
05:21:13.230 --> 05:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
aware maybe fees should be increased yes
 
05:21:19.150 --> 05:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
you this is what you get for encouraging
 
05:21:25.548 --> 05:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
me um General comment not a question per
 
05:21:28.590 --> 05:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
se I do appreciate that in many ways the
 
05:21:30.390 --> 05:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
department is self funded because they
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
collect funds and they retain what they
 
05:21:33.430 --> 05:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
need to operate and they send the rest
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund
 
05:21:38.670 --> 05:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
right that's obviously I know that you
 
05:21:40.990 --> 05:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
working hard to still cut cost because
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
every dollars that you guys don't need
 
05:21:44.670 --> 05:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
to retain is a dollar that goes to the
 
05:21:47.670 --> 05:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
highway fund which is in a not great
 
05:21:49.628 --> 05:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
shape financially overall so I just
 
05:21:51.868 --> 05:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to emphasize for you guys because
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
I know you are already doing it but the
 
05:21:55.628 --> 05:21:55.638 align:start position:0%
importance of continuing to look for way
 
05:21:57.430 --> 05:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
to cut cost even though you do have the
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
funds to operate because every dollar
 
05:22:02.948 --> 05:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
you guys use to collect those funds is a
 
05:22:04.990 --> 05:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
dollar that later we don't have it to
 
05:22:06.990 --> 05:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
spend so you know being a revenue
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
generator is great but we could always
 
05:22:10.030 --> 05:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
generate more Revenue if we spend even
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
less to do the same job as long as
 
05:22:14.350 --> 05:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
that's possible and I know that you are
 
05:22:16.510 --> 05:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
squeezing that Penny really hard so I'm
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
not worried but you know since we seem
 
05:22:22.390 --> 05:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
to have 30 seconds to spare thank you
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm done well you know just just a
 
05:22:26.150 --> 05:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
followup when you bring that up I I
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
think it's a good point when you use the
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
term operate just at a high level with
 
05:22:32.548 --> 05:22:32.558 align:start position:0%
the DMV so you've just you know Mickey
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
gave you the um overview on cost of
 
05:22:36.390 --> 05:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
collections but when I look at what
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
director morasco and his leadership team
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
are in charge of over there with the
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
Licensing Bureau the registration Bureau
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
the titling Bureau pushing out these um
 
05:22:49.708 --> 05:22:49.718 align:start position:0%
passenger license exams and Commercial
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles exams and the customer
 
05:22:54.750 --> 05:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
service is critical ensuring that not
 
05:22:57.150 --> 05:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
only can they do it um they can meet the
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
needs of the customers but they can do
 
05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
it you know securely and safely so we
 
05:23:03.470 --> 05:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
always look at what we try and do is
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
balance the customer service and
 
05:23:07.548 --> 05:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
ensuring that and when we look at the
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
DMV you things are increasing you know
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
the demand for services are increasing
 
05:23:13.868 --> 05:23:13.878 align:start position:0%
so there's a great deal of uh emphasis
 
05:23:16.830 --> 05:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
put on customer service and how quickly
 
05:23:18.590 --> 05:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
we can turn these titles around how
 
05:23:19.948 --> 05:23:19.958 align:start position:0%
quickly people can get their cars
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
registered get their licenses done new
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
drivers take their test their skills
 
05:23:27.868 --> 05:23:27.878 align:start position:0%
test their their their uh road test and
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
so it's a balance there but we've we've
 
05:23:32.310 --> 05:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
tried to do everything we can to ensure
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
that that level of service will be what
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
your constituents you know have been
 
05:23:40.030 --> 05:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
used to absolutely and when I mean
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
operating I mean operating at the level
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
expected by our constituents and by the
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
people who pay all those fees and taxes
 
05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
who have a right to expect good service
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
so absolutely no So speaking of
 
05:23:51.910 --> 05:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
constituent service this reminded me of
 
05:23:52.868 --> 05:23:52.878 align:start position:0%
something I think I brought to you
 
05:23:55.310 --> 05:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
before where one of my
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
constituents uh was went through the
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
small claims court and got to the point
 
05:24:02.948 --> 05:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
where the judge issued a um bench
 
05:24:05.190 --> 05:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
warrant and it came back to the
 
05:24:07.110 --> 05:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
constituent oh you got to get the guy's
 
05:24:09.430 --> 05:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
birth a you recall this convers ation I
 
05:24:11.230 --> 05:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
do and I had a follow up with the courts
 
05:24:13.390 --> 05:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
immediately after this so I also have
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
followed up with the Supreme Court and
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
I've not yet I I the DMV provided a form
 
05:24:22.470 --> 05:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
to them eventually which uh this person
 
05:24:24.750 --> 05:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
has filled out and send back but we've
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
heard nothing back since then so is she
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
going to get that birth
 
05:24:32.830 --> 05:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
date again I I made I made a phone call
 
05:24:34.590 --> 05:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
contemporaneous to this meeting and I'll
 
05:24:37.110 --> 05:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up again okay cuz the DMV
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
eventually provided the court
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
with a their their form um that would
 
05:24:44.670 --> 05:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
request the to request the birth date
 
05:24:47.230 --> 05:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
and that was returned and um maybe
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
offline sir we can work on this and I
 
05:24:51.350 --> 05:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
can look at the particular case and okay
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
see where it's at thank
 
05:24:57.390 --> 05:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
you yes of course represent Murray um
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
while you know we're picking your brains
 
05:25:01.350 --> 05:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
on some of these things um and you have
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
impact on the highway fund and the
 
05:25:04.670 --> 05:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
highway fund certainly impacts you uh
 
05:25:08.310 --> 05:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
what is your views on equitably managed
 
05:25:10.868 --> 05:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
managing electric cars uh in terms of
 
05:25:12.948 --> 05:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
their Road
 
05:25:15.390 --> 05:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
usage we're all looking for good ideas
 
05:25:15.400 --> 05:25:16.990 align:start position:0%
usage we're all looking for good ideas
here

05:25:16.990 --> 05:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:25:19.948 --> 05:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
about so I mean are you looking for what
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
the Fe should be it imp the highway fund
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are not paying the the
 
05:25:26.788 --> 05:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
gas tax going to you know usage of the
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
road but my car uses the road and I know
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
that there's there's some sort of a c
 
05:25:35.670 --> 05:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
tax or charge now is that sufficient is
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
that Equitable is that you know is that
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
the right direction which to go I guess
 
05:25:41.670 --> 05:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for opinions on how you
 
05:25:43.948 --> 05:25:43.958 align:start position:0%
manage um electric vehicle usage on the
 
05:25:45.628 --> 05:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
road because they don't use gas but they
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
sure use the roads I I know assistant
 
05:25:49.548 --> 05:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner Lavoy has looked into this
 
05:25:51.230 --> 05:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
a little and I'll I'll defer I'll
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
provide some followup from him so that
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
we can give you better information it's
 
05:25:56.708 --> 05:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
a good good question but they have been
 
05:25:58.868 --> 05:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
looking at this but I'm not prepared to
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:08.548 --> 05:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
now so we have to Comm commcial
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement division of State
 
05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
Police number our count 305 which is
 
05:26:16.480 --> 05:26:17.830 align:start position:0%
Police number our count 305 which is
Page

05:26:17.830 --> 05:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
Page
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:25.150 --> 05:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
thereabouts just want to make sure I'm
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
else so you dropped a couple of
 
05:26:37.600 --> 05:26:38.868 align:start position:0%
else so you dropped a couple of
positions

05:26:38.868 --> 05:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:26:38.878 --> 05:26:41.430 align:start position:0%
positions
in

05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:26:44.190 --> 05:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
2305 I guess that's page
 
05:26:47.868 --> 05:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
448 we unfunded 15 positions here to
 
05:26:51.230 --> 05:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
meet the targets
 
05:26:53.310 --> 05:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
15 so in addition
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
to this is Page 448 and it's accounting
 
05:26:57.440 --> 05:26:59.670 align:start position:0%
to this is Page 448 and it's accounting
unit

05:26:59.670 --> 05:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
unit
 
05:27:01.910 --> 05:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
2305 so your permanent classified shows
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
52 down to 50 but then you unfunded a
 
05:27:06.590 --> 05:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
bunch of those is that what you're
 
05:27:09.548 --> 05:27:09.558 align:start position:0%
saying on top of that 15 so you reduced
 
05:27:12.030 --> 05:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
two you limited two positions completely
 
05:27:42.270 --> 05:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:04.548 --> 05:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
traffic she's getting it if you can give
 
05:28:08.190 --> 05:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
her one minute no that's fine which
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:24.628 --> 05:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
2305 so the count so looks she reduced
 
05:28:26.430 --> 05:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
two two are gone unless they're part of
 
05:28:28.030 --> 05:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
the transfers they are part of the
 
05:28:30.390 --> 05:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
transfers they transfers yes so two are
 
05:28:32.910 --> 05:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
transfers and 15 were unfunded correct
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
okay so it's been reduced to transferred
 
05:28:34.798 --> 05:28:49.910 align:start position:0%
okay so it's been reduced to transferred
to

05:28:49.910 --> 05:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:53.590 --> 05:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
and what and what's the vacancy in that
 
05:28:56.350 --> 05:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
department out of the 50 or
 
05:28:59.708 --> 05:28:59.718 align:start position:0%
52 I can give you that that's Troop G so
 
05:29:02.190 --> 05:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
and actually enforcement spreads across
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
different um troops so we can provide
 
05:29:08.548 --> 05:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
05:29:09.750 --> 05:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's probably in your big chart you
 
05:29:10.708 --> 05:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
gave me too I just thought you might
 
05:29:10.718 --> 05:29:11.868 align:start position:0%
gave me too I just thought you might
help

05:29:11.868 --> 05:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:29:14.910 --> 05:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
it off the top of your head but I I I
 
05:29:16.910 --> 05:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
will say this the but that's a good
 
05:29:20.510 --> 05:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
question so that wasn't actually an a
 
05:29:23.708 --> 05:29:23.718 align:start position:0%
very good answer I think the colonel
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
when he has done these transfers I think
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that as
 
05:29:27.440 --> 05:29:28.230 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that as
we're

05:29:28.230 --> 05:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
we're
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
moving uh positions as we're unfunded
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
positions looking forward with what we
 
05:29:36.030 --> 05:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
have funded he understands the needs of
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
the division of State Police in troops a
 
05:29:40.590 --> 05:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
through G what we need in the
 
05:29:43.548 --> 05:29:43.558 align:start position:0%
specialized units detectives which is
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
5412 uh major crime unit crime scene so
 
05:29:49.270 --> 05:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
he balances this out it seems
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
complicated with all the different
 
05:29:52.548 --> 05:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
position numbers funding you know
 
05:29:54.270 --> 05:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
funding sources for how they fund the
 
05:29:56.788 --> 05:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
Troopers but the colonel does a good job
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
with looking at how do I run the
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
division of State Police and where do I
 
05:30:02.830 --> 05:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
need Troopers so it's actually um but
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
but that's really his responsibility so
 
05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
while you hear a number so high in one
 
05:30:09.190 --> 05:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
when you look at the seven troops which
 
05:30:11.788 --> 05:30:11.798 align:start position:0%
is operations you know across the state
 
05:30:14.948 --> 05:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
he it's really it's his job to balance
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.840 --> 05:30:27.948 align:start position:0%
 
has

05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
decrease State Police Communications is
 
05:30:32.190 --> 05:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
this related to what we were talking
 
05:30:36.350 --> 05:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:39.070 --> 05:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
2927 they're conversation about
 
05:30:41.708 --> 05:30:41.718 align:start position:0%
Communications radio the I believe these
 
05:30:41.718 --> 05:30:43.990 align:start position:0%
Communications radio the I believe these
are

05:30:43.990 --> 05:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
dispatchers okay so so not related to
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
the separate okay separate okay all
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
right um so there's a decrease
 
05:30:56.708 --> 05:30:56.718 align:start position:0%
there only one person but but about half
 
05:30:59.868 --> 05:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
the general funds which I love but I'm
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
wondering what's happening there I don't
 
05:31:05.548 --> 05:31:05.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
so what page are you on 450
 
05:31:17.708 --> 05:31:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.990 --> 05:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
it oh that's good though that's what
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:33.390 --> 05:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:41.910 --> 05:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:44.110 --> 05:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
yeah Trump I got a big boost right good
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
good good
 
05:31:48.390 --> 05:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
good so the reduction in Personnel here
 
05:31:51.590 --> 05:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
is one position moved to Legal the
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
transfer but as a so okay great thank
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
you as a general
 
05:31:57.628 --> 05:31:57.638 align:start position:0%
question represent Murray was just
 
05:32:01.070 --> 05:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
pointing out that the the funding while
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
appearing flat in total is shifting from
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
General over to Turnpike and and and and
 
05:32:08.708 --> 05:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
Highway which is is
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
fantastic how is that able to happen
 
05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
everywhere sure I think she's looking it
 
05:32:31.150 --> 05:32:31.160 align:start position:0%
up but you can certainly have while
 
05:32:34.590 --> 05:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking at up um I'm slightly
 
05:32:36.430 --> 05:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
less enthusiastic about the use of
 
05:32:38.310 --> 05:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
Highway funds because we will at some
 
05:32:40.270 --> 05:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
point have to put General funds money to
 
05:32:41.948 --> 05:32:41.958 align:start position:0%
the highway fund so if we take it from
 
05:32:43.628 --> 05:32:43.638 align:start position:0%
one end and put it back into another
 
05:32:46.350 --> 05:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:49.150 --> 05:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
really increase fees baby I'm that
 
05:32:52.590 --> 05:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
Highway until that funding is fixed yes
 
05:32:55.270 --> 05:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
fine fine fine yes but obviously higher
 
05:32:57.390 --> 05:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
use of Turnpike funds is nice again
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
because it does relieve a burden on the
 
05:33:00.750 --> 05:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
general fund and I'll let you finish
 
05:33:02.590 --> 05:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
looking up the answer to the original
 
05:33:02.600 --> 05:33:04.310 align:start position:0%
looking up the answer to the original
question

05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
but look if we can plug that great but
 
05:33:10.590 --> 05:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
until we I celebrate that's fine so we
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
we were provided a target for um turn P
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
funds as well but this is just a shift
 
05:33:16.990 --> 05:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
and fund mix so we have um the same fund
 
05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
mix across different accounting units
 
05:33:21.390 --> 05:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
for flexibility to move appropriation if
 
05:33:24.110 --> 05:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
needed for the next B so we didn't add
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
more turn f um right which is which is
 
05:33:29.830 --> 05:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
great so my question sort of is we we
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
flexibility if you have it we have
 
05:33:38.788 --> 05:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
it correct you
 
05:33:41.948 --> 05:33:41.958 align:start position:0%
okay so what do we need to know in terms
 
05:33:45.628 --> 05:33:45.638 align:start position:0%
of which accounts have that flexibility
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
I assume it's not just any account has
 
05:33:49.708 --> 05:33:49.718 align:start position:0%
correct they need to be geared towards
 
05:33:52.910 --> 05:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
um uh supporting um Tas towards the turn
 
05:33:55.390 --> 05:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
fighte funds so we we can we can provide
 
05:33:57.110 --> 05:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
that um accounting units that are
 
05:33:59.868 --> 05:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
restricted specifically um to from that
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
source of fund okay okay to well to
 
05:34:05.310 --> 05:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
Mickey yes yeah right go ahead mickeey
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:11.750 --> 05:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
we've got we we've got in the budget
 
05:34:13.390 --> 05:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
here the accounts that have used
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
turnpikes in the P Turnpike funds in the
 
05:34:19.390 --> 05:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
past okay um we don't have a defined
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
limit necessarily but there the
 
05:34:23.670 --> 05:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation would
 
05:34:27.070 --> 05:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
probably ask you to exercise some uh
 
05:34:28.830 --> 05:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
caution with just using a ton of
 
05:34:32.110 --> 05:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funds for other purposes beyond
 
05:34:34.030 --> 05:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
what we're already doing for state
 
05:34:36.390 --> 05:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
police enforcement and of those roads I
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
I I get it and I'd like to as much
 
05:34:39.628 --> 05:34:39.638 align:start position:0%
caution as I can but I still need to
 
05:34:42.910 --> 05:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
balance the budget okay so I'm just
 
05:34:44.270 --> 05:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
trying to open up as many doors as
 
05:34:46.030 --> 05:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
possible not trying to jump through all
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:53.910 --> 05:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
but so and just to add a bit more color
 
05:34:56.110 --> 05:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the turnpike funds for example
 
05:34:57.788 --> 05:34:57.798 align:start position:0%
have to be managed carefully because we
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
have to keep them at a certain level we
 
05:35:01.070 --> 05:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
got to make sure they match the revenues
 
05:35:03.270 --> 05:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
and so on but at the end of the day this
 
05:35:03.280 --> 05:35:04.150 align:start position:0%
and so on but at the end of the day this
is

05:35:04.150 --> 05:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
a a tough budget which is hopefully a
 
05:35:10.310 --> 05:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
one-time tough budget because we are
 
05:35:12.910 --> 05:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
hoping the economy will turn around
 
05:35:16.150 --> 05:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
so if there are funds where we have a
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
bit of flexibility in terms of treating
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
them for the lack of a better word as a
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know emergency fund or whatever
 
05:35:24.830 --> 05:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
Reserve fund or what not this may be the
 
05:35:27.548 --> 05:35:27.558 align:start position:0%
year when we may be a bit more willing
 
05:35:30.310 --> 05:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
to you know look into those
 
05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
possibilities with a hope of you know
 
05:35:34.590 --> 05:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
reducing our draw from them in the next
 
05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
budget so we don't continue to drain
 
05:35:38.070 --> 05:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
them at the you know un usually
 
05:35:40.030 --> 05:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
frustrate so I'm not saying that I have
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
any Targets in mind or anything it's
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
just a general statement that this is a
 
05:35:47.708 --> 05:35:47.718 align:start position:0%
tough year and we are trying to get
 
05:35:50.670 --> 05:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
through it without cutting things that
 
05:35:53.830 --> 05:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
would be very painful to cut and then
 
05:35:55.948 --> 05:35:55.958 align:start position:0%
would cost more to restore later and so
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
on and so forth so this is where we are
 
05:36:00.110 --> 05:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
coming from and I thought that you know
 
05:36:02.030 --> 05:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
again just understanding a bit more of
 
05:36:04.270 --> 05:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
the mindset may help you
 
05:36:07.708 --> 05:36:07.718 align:start position:0%
guys then 40003 the traffic Bureau so
 
05:36:09.868 --> 05:36:09.878 align:start position:0%
that's where you move the State Police
 
05:36:11.788 --> 05:36:11.798 align:start position:0%
from Highway fund to general fund and
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
you did that because not because of the
 
05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
funding but because to better align them
 
05:36:16.750 --> 05:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
with their respons with the kinds of
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
people they work with or something
 
05:36:28.590 --> 05:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:31.990 --> 05:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
you another big enforcement look at
 
05:36:34.708 --> 05:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
that another big one enforcement but
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's relatively flat down a little which
 
05:36:37.320 --> 05:36:53.628 align:start position:0%
it's relatively flat down a little which
is

05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:00.670 --> 05:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
good are the horses Hampton Police or is
 
05:37:05.590 --> 05:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
that do you have any thing with the
 
05:37:07.590 --> 05:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
horses I'm just looking at the Hampton
 
05:37:09.788 --> 05:37:09.798 align:start position:0%
Beach detail um their horses are their
 
05:37:12.030 --> 05:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
police horses aren't they their mounted
 
05:37:14.230 --> 05:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
unit is Hampton we have a detail that
 
05:37:14.240 --> 05:37:17.350 align:start position:0%
unit is Hampton we have a detail that
supports

05:37:17.350 --> 05:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:22.830 --> 05:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:27.190 --> 05:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:30.030 --> 05:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
for what I'm looking for I'm looking for
 
05:37:55.390 --> 05:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:58.990 --> 05:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead go ahead thank you on U page
 
05:38:00.990 --> 05:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
455 count
 
05:38:01.000 --> 05:38:02.948 align:start position:0%
455 count
40112

05:38:02.948 --> 05:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
40112
 
05:38:04.830 --> 05:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
412 law
 
05:38:09.190 --> 05:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:12.430 --> 05:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
those look like leases right it's
 
05:38:15.868 --> 05:38:15.878 align:start position:0%
not is it Capital Loans what I mean it's
 
05:38:18.030 --> 05:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
not a big amount but I'm just trying to
 
05:38:20.788 --> 05:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
understand usually if we see loans that
 
05:38:22.708 --> 05:38:22.718 align:start position:0%
are longterm we see larger amounts than
 
05:38:22.718 --> 05:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
are longterm we see larger amounts than
that

05:38:23.510 --> 05:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:26.190 --> 05:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to figure out if there
 
05:38:28.110 --> 05:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
just leases that may be accounted as
 
05:38:32.350 --> 05:38:32.360 align:start position:0%
Debt Service or it's a smaller loans
 
05:38:35.070 --> 05:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
or it's not any meaningful variation
 
05:38:36.510 --> 05:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
obviously the payment schedules are the
 
05:38:38.430 --> 05:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
payment schedules but
 
05:38:41.190 --> 05:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
but while everybody else is looking for
 
05:38:41.200 --> 05:38:45.990 align:start position:0%
but while everybody else is looking for
better

05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:49.070 --> 05:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions rest of you all up to special
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
expenses page we'll have to get back
 
05:38:52.750 --> 05:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
with you at the det no stress it
 
05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
honestly if there is stuff that needs to
 
05:38:56.750 --> 05:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
be on The Cutting Room floor this could
 
05:38:58.390 --> 05:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
be one of them if it's easy to find
 
05:39:00.230 --> 05:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
great if not no don't worry don't jump
 
05:39:01.708 --> 05:39:01.718 align:start position:0%
ahead I just want I make sure I'm synced
 
05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
activities 46 page 46 you must
 
05:39:12.190 --> 05:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
have you don't have to flip ah head I
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
just want if you up to that point don't
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:19.468 --> 05:39:19.478 align:start position:0%
rush my my activities are in different
 
05:39:20.670 --> 05:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
order than your
 
05:39:23.788 --> 05:39:23.798 align:start position:0%
activities I would you know for I'm
 
05:39:25.390 --> 05:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
happy to see you did not need to use a
 
05:39:30.788 --> 05:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:33.468 --> 05:39:33.478 align:start position:0%
with it's
 
05:39:39.190 --> 05:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:52.190 --> 05:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
sharing generically speaking what is
 
05:39:55.350 --> 05:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
State overhead
 
05:39:55.360 --> 05:39:58.510 align:start position:0%
State overhead
charges

05:39:58.510 --> 05:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:01.390 --> 05:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
4004 it's up on page 460 when you get
 
05:40:04.948 --> 05:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:27.190 --> 05:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
um this accounting unit is to pay um
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
administrative services for the S cap
 
05:40:33.708 --> 05:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
which is a Statewide um cost allocation
 
05:40:35.430 --> 05:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
plan so just say it again a little
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
louder um this is up to pay
 
05:40:40.230 --> 05:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
administrative Services uh for the
 
05:40:43.350 --> 05:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide um cost allocation plan the S
 
05:41:03.150 --> 05:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:06.468 --> 05:41:06.478 align:start position:0%
D just a reminder 004 that's the well
 
05:41:08.270 --> 05:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
inter agency that's not the cost of
 
05:41:10.868 --> 05:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
collection is that something
 
05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
else under a funding um uh so um we the
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
each division has a class 29 which is
 
05:41:21.750 --> 05:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
inter agency payment and that reimburses
 
05:41:23.990 --> 05:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
this account so this is just um where
 
05:41:26.468 --> 05:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
the source of funding is coming from and
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
then we take this appropriation and pay
 
05:41:40.390 --> 05:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:44.190 --> 05:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:49.708 --> 05:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
expenses oh look at that I'm towards the
 
05:41:57.868 --> 05:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:04.868 --> 05:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
so is there anything that we've missed
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:29.910 --> 05:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
we take account of I was going to say
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
anything we miss they want us to see
 
05:42:37.708 --> 05:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:40.230 --> 05:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then should we go through hb2
 
05:42:44.788 --> 05:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:50.750 --> 05:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
or every page every page are are you no
 
05:42:52.390 --> 05:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's fine go go ahead and deal with it
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
what I said what I meant was
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
hp2 you okay you with okay going
 
05:42:57.680 --> 05:42:59.750 align:start position:0%

05:43:43.708 --> 05:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
uh we do have one additional ask for
 
05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
house bill to and that is the northern
 
05:43:48.390 --> 05:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
Bard and Alliance to align with the
 
05:43:50.590 --> 05:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
executive summ summary from the director
 
05:43:53.590 --> 05:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's um executive summary
 
05:43:55.390 --> 05:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
um and we'll provide you um Mickey the
 
05:43:57.510 --> 05:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
language uh to share but uh we are
 
05:44:00.310 --> 05:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
asking for uh 600,000 for fiscal year
 
05:44:03.030 --> 05:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
ending in 20126 for the uh Northern
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
board and
 
05:44:05.948 --> 05:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
Alliance so there's already a half a
 
05:44:08.230 --> 05:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars each year in this is
 
05:44:10.628 --> 05:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
that correct so that's Northern Shield
 
05:44:11.750 --> 05:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'll let the department speak to the
 
05:44:13.390 --> 05:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
difference correct um the northern
 
05:44:15.270 --> 05:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
Shield is designated for four counties
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
where this um is
 
05:44:20.510 --> 05:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
separate separate works but can do a
 
05:44:22.868 --> 05:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
little more be a little more
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
explicit well as as we discussed
 
05:44:28.670 --> 05:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
Northern Shield is the four counties got
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
it that's the million dollars over the
 
05:44:34.350 --> 05:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
buum yep the northern border Alliance is
 
05:44:36.190 --> 05:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
for those Community for those
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
departments that are are participating
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
in the northern border Alliance so okay
 
05:44:42.468 --> 05:44:42.478 align:start position:0%
this appropriation is to get us through
 
05:44:44.708 --> 05:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
the um the bami so and you had mentioned
 
05:44:46.830 --> 05:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
that earlier had you not or did I you I
 
05:44:49.350 --> 05:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
didn't speak to the northern border okay
 
05:44:51.310 --> 05:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
the question was really focused on so so
 
05:44:54.390 --> 05:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
Northern Shield is for drugs say again
 
05:44:56.590 --> 05:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
drug enforcement specifically for drugs
 
05:44:58.708 --> 05:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
drug enfor and State
 
05:45:02.548 --> 05:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
Police no and no that's for the counties
 
05:45:05.390 --> 05:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
counties so that's to build a team so
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
when we put out granite Shield so that's
 
05:45:10.910 --> 05:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
funding to locals funding to locals okay
 
05:45:13.628 --> 05:45:13.638 align:start position:0%

Shield different things they're the same
 
05:45:20.708 --> 05:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
okay fine Shield so Shield's a critical
 
05:45:22.468 --> 05:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
World okay so right this is a new
 
05:45:25.510 --> 05:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
initiative though um okay so talk about
 
05:45:26.910 --> 05:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
the new the other one though the the so
 
05:45:29.430 --> 05:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
the northern border
 
05:45:32.548 --> 05:45:32.558 align:start position:0%
Alliance GRE is the immigration

border is 58 miles long so for this
 
05:45:46.948 --> 05:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
budget we've appropriated 600,000 to
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
keep it going so is is this police this
 
05:45:53.670 --> 05:45:53.680 align:start position:0%

northern border Alliance participants
 
05:46:20.788 --> 05:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
and all will run to your budget this
 
05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
budget this budget which is in your
 
05:46:28.110 --> 05:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
domain right yeah okay so it's it's less
 
05:46:30.190 --> 05:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
than it was in the last bium the last
 
05:46:32.430 --> 05:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
bium had equipment dollars in there but
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
we factored in what we have continued
 
05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
what hasn't lapsed and this is what we
 
05:46:39.510 --> 05:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
put forward to understanding you know
 
05:46:41.030 --> 05:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
how many what's the capacity of the
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
program to keep it going so and the
 
05:46:46.548 --> 05:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
governor I'm assuming left it
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
out or it you need it in there because
 
05:46:52.670 --> 05:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
correct I
 
05:46:56.628 --> 05:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
can't well I'm just trying understand
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
did the governor was this this was
 
05:47:01.948 --> 05:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
previously funded through house bill to
 
05:47:05.070 --> 05:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
got it and now it's being put in our um
 
05:47:07.590 --> 05:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
operating budget but funded
 
05:47:12.510 --> 05:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's reduced um in the bium
 
05:47:16.230 --> 05:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
because of the funding um that we have
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
remaining that will um that will still
 
05:47:21.830 --> 05:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
be able to um support this initiative
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
moving forward I'm just trying to
 
05:47:26.110 --> 05:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
understand this hb2 so is did the
 
05:47:27.750 --> 05:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
governor already have some funding in
 
05:47:30.390 --> 05:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
the budget yes in hb1 well I I can't
 
05:47:32.150 --> 05:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
speak to that there are funds remaining
 
05:47:34.430 --> 05:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
which I'd let Melanie speak to from the
 
05:47:37.070 --> 05:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
last right the remaining funds were
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
appropriated from house bill to last by
 
05:47:40.788 --> 05:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
any minut it's not elapsing so we do
 
05:47:42.110 --> 05:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
have a current budget for it this is
 
05:47:43.750 --> 05:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
just adding the extra 600,000 okay so
 
05:47:45.868 --> 05:47:45.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try toass my question again
 
05:47:49.830 --> 05:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
so did the department present this
 
05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
request you're presenting to us today to
 
05:47:54.310 --> 05:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
the governor during the governor's phase
 
05:47:56.070 --> 05:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
and it just didn't get put in or just
 
05:47:57.390 --> 05:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
was never even presented to the governor
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
during the governor's phase correct it
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
it was presented I think it may have
 
05:48:04.150 --> 05:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
just been an oversight to add it on okay
 
05:48:05.830 --> 05:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
but as far as you know what it did it
 
05:48:07.590 --> 05:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
was put forth at least whether it was
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
intentional or not yeah absolutely and I
 
05:48:12.270 --> 05:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
know the governor supports this I'm not
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
questioning that so I yeah but I think
 
05:48:16.990 --> 05:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
but but back to being you know fiscally
 
05:48:19.270 --> 05:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
responsible we looked we look really
 
05:48:21.628 --> 05:48:21.638 align:start position:0%
closely with melan's Team what are the
 
05:48:24.390 --> 05:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
existing funds what's the capacity for
 
05:48:27.750 --> 05:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
these nine agencies how much can we work
 
05:48:29.310 --> 05:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
how many dollars are we going to need
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
over the next 24 months to keep these
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
details going so that's why we came up
 
05:48:35.628 --> 05:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
with the 600,000 I me you have seen our
 
05:48:37.468 --> 05:48:37.478 align:start position:0%
ways and means projections
 
05:48:39.750 --> 05:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
right no no I'm
 
05:48:41.788 --> 05:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
serious have you seen our ways and means
 
05:48:43.230 --> 05:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
projections here in the house I know
 
05:48:45.150 --> 05:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
that there's a shortage
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
yeah okay there you go kind of an
 
05:48:48.670 --> 05:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
understatement but yes you're right okay
 
05:48:50.590 --> 05:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
no I'm I'm aware
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay absolutely represented Roy because
 
05:48:56.548 --> 05:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
you have a a shortage in Manpower are
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
you going to be using some drones to
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
help you up in the North Country to be
 
05:49:04.270 --> 05:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
able to cover that vast acreage that you
 
05:49:07.270 --> 05:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
have to sure so I I'm I can't can't I
 
05:49:08.830 --> 05:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak to anything that's
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
you know law enforcement sensitive or
 
05:49:13.548 --> 05:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
what but I mean you know unmanned aerial
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
systems there's no secret that people
 
05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
use drones but I think the most
 
05:49:20.670 --> 05:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
important thing to know is we it took it
 
05:49:22.350 --> 05:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
it was a lot of work to get this up and
 
05:49:24.270 --> 05:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
running to get all these Troopers
 
05:49:26.310 --> 05:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
trained to get the locals trained and be
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
able to go out and work with um work
 
05:49:30.990 --> 05:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
with CBP Customs and Border Protection
 
05:49:33.670 --> 05:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
work and have a partnership um the other
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
thing is we talk about shortages so a
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
fair question is how are you going to do
 
05:49:40.150 --> 05:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
this well they will be working on
 
05:49:42.110 --> 05:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
overtime and what we do this is run out
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
of troop F on northernmost Barracks so
 
05:49:47.270 --> 05:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
the um the troop Commander up there
 
05:49:49.150 --> 05:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
coordinates it and he works with these
 
05:49:51.070 --> 05:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
other departments to fill details like
 
05:49:53.150 --> 05:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
when can we work and I will share this
 
05:49:57.030 --> 05:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
with you um in speaking to them they
 
05:49:59.430 --> 05:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
have said it's never been better we
 
05:50:01.468 --> 05:50:01.478 align:start position:0%
actually are seeing people up here now
 
05:50:03.390 --> 05:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
where there were none we have none so
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're working more details I mean it's
 
05:50:07.070 --> 05:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
one thing to have a program but if
 
05:50:09.548 --> 05:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to work so they are
 
05:50:12.190 --> 05:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
working they're going to work um so
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's really on on on the border and
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know our our details of this we
 
05:50:18.390 --> 05:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
those are all public records like what
 
05:50:20.030 --> 05:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
have we done how many details did they
 
05:50:21.910 --> 05:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
work how much did they expend how many
 
05:50:23.548 --> 05:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
vehicles did they stop what type of
 
05:50:26.708 --> 05:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
arrest the granite shield and now the
 
05:50:29.708 --> 05:50:29.718 align:start position:0%
northern Shield is focused more on the
 
05:50:31.628 --> 05:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
investigations the drug traffickers
 
05:50:34.230 --> 05:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
who's selling drugs you know catching
 
05:50:35.468 --> 05:50:35.478 align:start position:0%
the drugs before they hit the
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
communities and and I think it is a very
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
good idea to get that North Country to
 
05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
pull together and partner to work
 
05:50:44.830 --> 05:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
together um really leverage each other
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
to help them um because it is it's a
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
long way away from conquer and to do an
 
05:50:52.030 --> 05:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
investigation the travel time driving up
 
05:50:53.868 --> 05:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
there but um they've done some great
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
work and I think that this will will
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
really build you know it I think they'll
 
05:50:59.948 --> 05:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
build a build a very strong team up
 
05:51:04.990 --> 05:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
$600,000 on
 
05:51:10.548 --> 05:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
is that um I wasn't clear 600,000 uh for
 
05:51:13.030 --> 05:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
the banum or each year and how much is
 
05:51:19.310 --> 05:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:23.230 --> 05:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
have so it' be 600 in the first um year
 
05:51:25.070 --> 05:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal but it would carry in for
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
so 600 for the baym to answer your
 
05:51:29.350 --> 05:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
question and then let see if I can get
 
05:52:00.270 --> 05:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.030 --> 05:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
there is currently a balance of uh um
 
05:52:13.830 --> 05:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
and what did it start with was it the S
 
05:52:18.310 --> 05:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
what was the original I'm trying to get
 
05:52:23.708 --> 05:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:23.718 --> 05:52:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:52:25.760 --> 05:52:29.830 align:start position:0%
that
1.4

05:52:29.830 --> 05:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:33.708 --> 05:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
35 if I may
 
05:52:39.230 --> 05:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:44.468 --> 05:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
ahead 24 25 by thank you the exact date
 
05:52:46.590 --> 05:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
that we again when this started we had
 
05:52:48.270 --> 05:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
to do the training so it took a while to
 
05:52:50.670 --> 05:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
get the training so we can provide when
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
the first when the
 
05:52:55.350 --> 05:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
operation when the operation began so
 
05:52:57.430 --> 05:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
just a quick question uh since you have
 
05:53:01.150 --> 05:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
about 300 I'm assuming that 300 that you
 
05:53:03.350 --> 05:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
have plus about 600 you're asking for
 
05:53:05.590 --> 05:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
are the 900 something that you expect to
 
05:53:07.788 --> 05:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
need to run through the next two years
 
05:53:09.990 --> 05:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
so basically burn rate is about 450 a
 
05:53:13.030 --> 05:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
year more or less just trying to
 
05:53:14.230 --> 05:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from
 
05:53:14.240 --> 05:53:19.468 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from
thank

05:53:19.468 --> 05:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:49.910 --> 05:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:52.230 --> 05:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
yes we don't need to go back over the
 
05:53:53.430 --> 05:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
house bill two sections we already
 
05:53:54.868 --> 05:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
discussed to this point so I would say
 
05:53:57.230 --> 05:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
the next one would be section 147 on
 
05:54:00.750 --> 05:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
page 63 and there's section 147 and 148
 
05:54:01.910 --> 05:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
two different sections that the
 
05:54:04.350 --> 05:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
department can speak
 
05:54:13.030 --> 05:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:16.150 --> 05:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
so the uh first
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
um the first house bill to change is uh
 
05:54:24.310 --> 05:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
to add for for uh division of um DMV and
 
05:54:26.310 --> 05:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's just to see to for the Department
 
05:54:28.030 --> 05:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
of Safety to address uh fictitious
 
05:54:31.110 --> 05:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
driver's license for undercover
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
operations so that's why we not needed
 
05:54:35.628 --> 05:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
to add that extra which which number was
 
05:54:38.430 --> 05:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
that what section on line uh eight of
 
05:54:38.440 --> 05:54:39.708 align:start position:0%
that what section on line uh eight of
page

05:54:39.708 --> 05:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:54:43.110 --> 05:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
63 oh 53 I think it's said 63 no it is
 
05:54:46.070 --> 05:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
page 63 63 line eight
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
y so in order to have someone go
 
05:54:51.190 --> 05:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
undercover with a driver's
 
05:54:54.150 --> 05:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
license you need the special permission
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
order for that I should think pit would
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
already have had that permission to do
 
05:54:59.590 --> 05:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
that that was our guidance from the H's
 
05:55:04.910 --> 05:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
huh you know
 
05:55:09.628 --> 05:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
right here he's talking about the fake
 
05:55:12.990 --> 05:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses this bad is any fake
 
05:55:15.310 --> 05:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
except now he adds the language talk
 
05:55:19.030 --> 05:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
specifically or so we get
 
05:55:19.040 --> 05:55:21.708 align:start position:0%
specifically or so we get
aover

05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
aover
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
work so I can't get my fake licenses
 
05:55:26.000 --> 05:55:34.590 align:start position:0%
work so I can't get my fake licenses
anymore

05:55:34.590 --> 05:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.310 --> 05:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
spy so that authorization you said is
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
for undercover work is that the full
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
extent of any scenario in which that
 
05:55:44.990 --> 05:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
authorization would be provided the
 
05:55:48.708 --> 05:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
authorization for a uh you know
 
05:55:51.230 --> 05:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
basically fictitious fim or simulated
 
05:55:53.310 --> 05:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
license and so on and so
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
forth is there any set of scenarios
 
05:55:58.510 --> 05:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
other than undercover work that that
 
05:56:01.070 --> 05:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
authorization May ever be used no and
 
05:56:02.548 --> 05:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
and again the director of Motor Vehicles
 
05:56:03.910 --> 05:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
would ensure that there's proper
 
05:56:06.350 --> 05:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
documentation from the hiring Authority
 
05:56:08.948 --> 05:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
um whether it's the chief or um to
 
05:56:10.708 --> 05:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
document who the person is that they
 
05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
would be working in that capacity and
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
when the capacity is over that those
 
05:56:16.590 --> 05:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
documents would be returned just asking
 
05:56:18.590 --> 05:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
because the law is rather broad as
 
05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
suggested it would allow you know any
 
05:56:23.670 --> 05:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
reason you authorize it could be used
 
05:56:25.390 --> 05:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm not planning to change the
 
05:56:27.110 --> 05:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
language I just wanted to understand
 
05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
your internal guard rails in terms of
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
when that newly available legal
 
05:56:34.990 --> 05:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
Authority would be used I think it
 
05:56:37.468 --> 05:56:37.478 align:start position:0%
obviously for a swan state or federal or
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
County officer I got it's just honestly
 
05:56:41.868 --> 05:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
obvious and what's in the law can be
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
different things I learned a long time
 
05:56:44.990 --> 05:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
ago not to look at the obvious reading
 
05:56:50.910 --> 05:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
of the law um I hear you okay I I got it
 
05:56:53.948 --> 05:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
I'm good I I I got the assurances from
 
05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
you on how it would be used that's
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I needed to hear at this
 
05:56:59.510 --> 05:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
time I'm good I appreciate the question
 
05:57:06.510 --> 05:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:09.830 --> 05:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
the second um on Section 148 on the same
 
05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
page line 12 we add um or authorization
 
05:57:16.468 --> 05:57:16.478 align:start position:0%
um agents and this is to allow driver
 
05:57:18.390 --> 05:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
records to be shared with the federal
 
05:57:24.270 --> 05:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:27.310 --> 05:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
authorized wonder how bro that can go
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:36.510 --> 05:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
um I know our state has a high value on
 
05:57:39.390 --> 05:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
privacy so um is this something we
 
05:57:42.270 --> 05:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
should try to consider booting to a
 
05:57:42.280 --> 05:57:43.868 align:start position:0%
should try to consider booting to a
policy

05:57:43.868 --> 05:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:57:46.270 --> 05:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
committee since I don't there's no appro
 
05:57:49.788 --> 05:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
appropriation here is that correct so
 
05:57:51.110 --> 05:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
another one of those things that's not
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
really a finance
 
05:57:55.310 --> 05:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
issue could you make a note I believe
 
05:57:56.990 --> 05:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
chairman wer is already working with
 
05:57:58.350 --> 05:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
Mike Kane to go through these to
 
05:58:00.270 --> 05:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
identify policy committees that we could
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
ask for their input perfect and can we
 
05:58:06.868 --> 05:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
add in there who's determining who who's
 
05:58:08.670 --> 05:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
authorized um you know where is this
 
05:58:11.110 --> 05:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
request coming from and we'll provide
 
05:58:12.628 --> 05:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
more on that obviously these requests
 
05:58:14.350 --> 05:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
have commit to the DMV this is something
 
05:58:16.030 --> 05:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
that they've experienced but you know
 
05:58:17.750 --> 05:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
fair question with driver privacy we'll
 
05:58:24.468 --> 05:58:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:27.430 --> 05:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
he thank you the remaining sections
 
05:58:31.070 --> 05:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
would be sections 150 151 and 152
 
05:58:34.270 --> 05:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
starting at the very bottom of page 63
 
05:58:36.150 --> 05:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
so you see the title there for section
 
05:58:53.708 --> 05:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
page and we owe you the followup
 
05:59:03.788 --> 05:59:03.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:06.948 --> 05:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
that may I
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
may I understand the driving reasons
 
05:59:11.628 --> 05:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
beside behind the whole group to
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
retirement thing yes on the HazMat
 
05:59:17.150 --> 05:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
incident response
 
05:59:19.070 --> 05:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
coordinator yes
 
05:59:23.390 --> 05:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
so we have so this kind of plays into
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
another one that is um next on policy
 
05:59:29.230 --> 05:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
and planning we have looked at filling
 
05:59:31.510 --> 05:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
positions in the past and I know that
 
05:59:33.350 --> 05:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
this position in it of itself is
 
05:59:35.430 --> 05:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
required by Statute if you look at the
 
05:59:37.510 --> 05:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
statute of the fire Marshall's office
 
05:59:40.350 --> 05:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
that position's been vacant for I know
 
05:59:42.350 --> 05:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
there were there were it was at least
 
05:59:44.910 --> 05:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
two years and possibly more that it was
 
05:59:47.190 --> 05:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
vacant and in my regular meetings with
 
05:59:49.750 --> 05:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal how are we having any
 
05:59:52.948 --> 05:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
luck do we have any applicants do we we
 
05:59:55.230 --> 05:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
we know I know we found one person that
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
stayed for a very short time maybe a
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
week or two but what it comes down to is
 
06:00:03.070 --> 06:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
we can't um retain somebody that has
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
that experience from New Hampshire that
 
06:00:08.230 --> 06:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
would um also want to collect their
 
06:00:11.110 --> 06:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
pension or be in group two so that's
 
06:00:13.230 --> 06:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
what we need
 
06:00:16.190 --> 06:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
um during full-time Services a hazardous
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
material incident response quarter the
 
06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
hazardous material incident response
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
quarter shall be eligible to be a group
 
06:00:22.670 --> 06:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
two member so if you're currently in the
 
06:00:24.830 --> 06:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
fire service today in New Hampshire and
 
06:00:27.270 --> 06:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
you want to move into this position you
 
06:00:30.350 --> 06:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
can't unless we fix it or address it so
 
06:00:32.270 --> 06:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
we're losing a lot of applicants because
 
06:00:35.190 --> 06:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
of you can't because this isn't to
 
06:00:35.200 --> 06:00:36.708 align:start position:0%
of you can't because this isn't to
correct

06:00:36.708 --> 06:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:00:38.070 --> 06:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
because you basically lose your
 
06:00:40.468 --> 06:00:40.478 align:start position:0%
connection to group two well it isn't we
 
06:00:42.150 --> 06:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
we it's no no but you're already in
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
group two yes you lose your you lose the
 
06:00:47.390 --> 06:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know the status yeah correct and
 
06:00:49.868 --> 06:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
nobody I mean I say nobody but generally
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
not many opt to go from group two to
 
06:00:55.868 --> 06:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:58.670 --> 06:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah just asking because obviously group
 
06:01:01.708 --> 06:01:01.718 align:start position:0%
two tends to be a significantly more
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
expensive and uh you know but it makes
 
06:01:07.150 --> 06:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
sense what you're say and I guess I
 
06:01:09.270 --> 06:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
should be grateful that uh nobody's
 
06:01:10.948 --> 06:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
requesting for the position to just be
 
06:01:12.868 --> 06:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
made grouped all together regardless so
 
06:01:15.910 --> 06:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'll take my uh small you know my Silver
 
06:01:18.788 --> 06:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
Linings here so yeah well and I know and
 
06:01:21.070 --> 06:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
if if you really look at it I mean it's
 
06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
such an important position the hazardous
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
material materials response coordinated
 
06:01:28.468 --> 06:01:28.478 align:start position:0%
for the entire
 
06:01:31.510 --> 06:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
State and and I'm I don't I'm not
 
06:01:32.910 --> 06:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
familiar at all with the job
 
06:01:35.150 --> 06:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for this but I would assume
 
06:01:36.990 --> 06:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
that they tend to be quite closely
 
06:01:39.868 --> 06:01:39.878 align:start position:0%
aligned to um experience that one can
 
06:01:41.430 --> 06:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
only acquire in New Hampshire through a
 
06:01:43.788 --> 06:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
group two position sure and there's a
 
06:01:45.628 --> 06:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
lot of great firefighters is Hazmat
 
06:01:48.070 --> 06:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
teams spread across the state right now
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
but this position is more in the fire
 
06:01:53.070 --> 06:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
moners office to you know our you know
 
06:01:55.830 --> 06:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
offer support and really coordination
 
06:01:57.670 --> 06:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
and and it is a it is an important
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
position but is it a very specific
 
06:02:02.948 --> 06:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
firefighter type skills or is it an
 
06:02:05.150 --> 06:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
administrative position that's what I'm
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
trying to understand no it's skills and
 
06:02:09.070 --> 06:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with these hazardous materials
 
06:02:11.390 --> 06:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
recognizing them understanding it you
 
06:02:13.110 --> 06:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
know what's the incident command whether
 
06:02:15.270 --> 06:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's a tanker that spills over or
 
06:02:18.270 --> 06:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
certain chemicals or um so it's it's
 
06:02:21.990 --> 06:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's really huh thank you I got it and
 
06:02:24.270 --> 06:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you what I I we will
 
06:02:26.548 --> 06:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
provide what's you know in the job
 
06:02:28.590 --> 06:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
description for that I think it's I
 
06:02:30.310 --> 06:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
think it's a good question so we'll
 
06:02:34.390 --> 06:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:37.510 --> 06:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
that edit as an editorial comment Mr
 
06:02:39.230 --> 06:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
chair it seems like there's several
 
06:02:41.230 --> 06:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
positions at the department of safety
 
06:02:43.708 --> 06:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to guess across our
 
06:02:47.468 --> 06:02:47.478 align:start position:0%
agencies that um our ability to fill
 
06:02:50.310 --> 06:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
positions at um some of the mid-level or
 
06:02:52.468 --> 06:02:52.478 align:start position:0%
higher ranks of the
 
06:02:56.110 --> 06:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
Departments um the compensation plan is
 
06:02:59.868 --> 06:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
not currently matching um you know the
 
06:03:01.390 --> 06:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
kind of incentives that we need people
 
06:03:03.390 --> 06:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
to move up the system it sounds like
 
06:03:05.910 --> 06:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is a larger problem than just one
 
06:03:08.430 --> 06:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
or two positions that we're hearing
 
06:03:11.670 --> 06:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
about today and
 
06:03:15.070 --> 06:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
um gosh that's that's alarming if we're
 
06:03:18.070 --> 06:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
having if we're having this in more than
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
one discussion um so I wonder you know
 
06:03:24.110 --> 06:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
maybe these are little fixes that we can
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
help you know independently for some
 
06:03:29.350 --> 06:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
current needs that the agencies are
 
06:03:30.750 --> 06:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
bringing to us but this sounds like a
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
big project in the
 
06:03:35.230 --> 06:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
future good we'll put you in charge no
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:03:40.110 --> 06:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:42.350 --> 06:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
everything is that are we done with that
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
one or other there all that we could ask
 
06:03:47.708 --> 06:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
for now and we'll get more back so the
 
06:03:50.070 --> 06:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
next one well I'll let you speak to
 
06:03:54.110 --> 06:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:58.510 --> 06:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
question uh for Section 151 um we are
 
06:04:01.628 --> 06:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
looking to remove so uh uh when we made
 
06:04:03.990 --> 06:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
this submission we inadvertently um
 
06:04:06.310 --> 06:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
requested as a add and not a removal so
 
06:04:09.868 --> 06:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
lines 19 through 23 should be
 
06:04:14.788 --> 06:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
um repealed or removed oh the last two
 
06:04:17.628 --> 06:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
sentence on a so I'm on page 50 uh
 
06:04:20.350 --> 06:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
64 so starting from the use of properly
 
06:04:22.910 --> 06:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
licensed correct all the way to the end
 
06:04:25.750 --> 06:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's ince it is so um both sentences
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
should be removed it was inadvertently
 
06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
submitted as an addition when it should
 
06:04:30.510 --> 06:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
have been um
 
06:04:32.948 --> 06:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
removed okay so there's one sentence
 
06:04:35.190 --> 06:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
instead of two or in both line both
 
06:04:37.788 --> 06:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
lines should be removed we're removing
 
06:04:40.390 --> 06:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
you want both deleted both
 
06:04:43.670 --> 06:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
lines basically instead of seeing it as
 
06:04:45.468 --> 06:04:45.478 align:start position:0%
a bold Edition it was meant to be a
 
06:04:47.230 --> 06:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
strike through the original language and
 
06:04:51.030 --> 06:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
no bold paragraph you know it happens
 
06:04:53.590 --> 06:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
don't worry about it they I'm perfect
 
06:04:55.190 --> 06:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
I'll throw stones at
 
06:04:58.948 --> 06:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
other yeah s why would you remove the
 
06:05:02.110 --> 06:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
provision of using on a proper witer van
 
06:05:05.030 --> 06:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
or vehicle um this is being requested uh
 
06:05:06.628 --> 06:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
because the assignment of the transport
 
06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
are val um validated through um
 
06:05:11.230 --> 06:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human human
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
services so it's already being um
 
06:05:15.150 --> 06:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
address through that
 
06:05:17.548 --> 06:05:17.558 align:start position:0%
agency so um it doesn't need to be
 
06:05:19.030 --> 06:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
included so we're not taking anything
 
06:05:20.548 --> 06:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
away or putting someone in the back of
 
06:05:22.190 --> 06:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
the station wagon corre Health and Human
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
Services is
 
06:05:26.270 --> 06:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
doing so is it just removing basically
 
06:05:26.280 --> 06:05:27.548 align:start position:0%
doing so is it just removing basically
redundant

06:05:27.548 --> 06:05:27.558 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
06:05:29.948 --> 06:05:29.958 align:start position:0%
language because honestly redundant
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
language is a pain in the tou because
 
06:05:33.230 --> 06:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
you try to edit it in one place you
 
06:05:34.670 --> 06:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
don't realize it's in the second place
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
and now you created a conflict so
 
06:05:38.830 --> 06:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
anytime we can identify redundant
 
06:05:40.628 --> 06:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
language where it's in five places it
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
should only be in one so we you know
 
06:05:45.150 --> 06:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's easier to read and understand so I
 
06:05:46.948 --> 06:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
really appreciate these types of efforts
 
06:05:53.110 --> 06:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:58.110 --> 06:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:02.548 --> 06:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
does okay else out with that
 
06:06:05.628 --> 06:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
one uh the following one uh following
 
06:06:08.628 --> 06:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
section uh 152 is similar to uh section
 
06:06:10.590 --> 06:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
150 where we're looking to have this
 
06:06:14.948 --> 06:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:19.070 --> 06:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:24.708 --> 06:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:24.718 --> 06:06:32.430 align:start position:0%
 
question

06:06:32.430 --> 06:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:36.350 --> 06:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
Mr any other questions on that one
 
06:06:38.670 --> 06:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
no okay and then the last section for
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety is on page 70
 
06:06:44.708 --> 06:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
or uh page 73 and that's just the
 
06:06:46.310 --> 06:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
language which we already talked about
 
06:06:48.510 --> 06:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
for the transfer from oplc to Department
 
06:06:54.190 --> 06:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:57.350 --> 06:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
familiar y mechanical licensing very
 
06:07:15.310 --> 06:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:18.030 --> 06:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
so is it two sections that relate to the
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
same or three sections two
 
06:07:31.590 --> 06:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:35.670 --> 06:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
189 yes it is yes that's the RSA for
 
06:07:37.868 --> 06:07:37.878 align:start position:0%
oplc they're just updating it from oplc
 
06:07:44.510 --> 06:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:47.548 --> 06:07:47.558 align:start position:0%
okay just how curi did you go before
 
06:07:47.558 --> 06:07:53.390 align:start position:0%
okay just how curi did you go before
division

06:07:53.390 --> 06:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:56.948 --> 06:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
one no we didn't no
 
06:08:00.150 --> 06:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay should we at
 
06:08:02.350 --> 06:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
least I mean you can speak with
 
06:08:05.110 --> 06:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire um okay typically
 
06:08:07.868 --> 06:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
we do have some sections that do cross
 
06:08:10.390 --> 06:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh divisions and we kind of just try to
 
06:08:12.310 --> 06:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
send them to one because it's a little
 
06:08:13.868 --> 06:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
yeah makes sense I gets a little
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
complicated to do code division work so
 
06:08:19.788 --> 06:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
tot can I assuming assuming that
 
06:08:22.708 --> 06:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
division one approves op plc's budget as
 
06:08:25.868 --> 06:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
it is I would say they are blessing this
 
06:08:29.548 --> 06:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
indirectly yeah all
 
06:08:32.788 --> 06:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
right so anything
 
06:08:35.948 --> 06:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
else you need to ask a question
 
06:08:38.868 --> 06:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go ahead can I add just a
 
06:08:41.910 --> 06:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of context one of these I
 
06:08:42.910 --> 06:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
know we're going to take a little
 
06:08:46.190 --> 06:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
different route and um perhaps ask other
 
06:08:52.310 --> 06:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
folks but to the one on page 63 line 12
 
06:08:56.390 --> 06:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
where um the request is to um add a
 
06:08:59.110 --> 06:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
language or their authorized agent I
 
06:09:01.830 --> 06:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
want to just go back um as a reminder
 
06:09:04.230 --> 06:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
about the fire fund so and I'm just
 
06:09:05.948 --> 06:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
going to repeat this
 
06:09:09.830 --> 06:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
um for context um so if you recall the
 
06:09:15.270 --> 06:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
fire fund is funded um through fees
 
06:09:17.670 --> 06:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
collected for providing copies of Motor
 
06:09:20.190 --> 06:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
Vehicle records and certificates as
 
06:09:24.150 --> 06:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
authorized under RSA 260 subsection 14
 
06:09:26.030 --> 06:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
these records are typically requested by
 
06:09:28.110 --> 06:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and other authorized
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
entities so without this language What's
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
Happening Here is that um so we ENT
 
06:09:39.628 --> 06:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
enter into with the DMV enters into umus
 
06:09:42.468 --> 06:09:42.478 align:start position:0%
with these companies and they want to do
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
business with us but they use an
 
06:09:48.270 --> 06:09:48.280 align:start position:0%
authorized agent to do this work and so
 
06:09:50.910 --> 06:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
we are not able to work with them and so
 
06:09:53.030 --> 06:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we wanted to add this
 
06:09:56.868 --> 06:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
language so that we can um do business
 
06:09:59.190 --> 06:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
in an ongoing way with them so can you
 
06:10:01.190 --> 06:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
remember me what that account is that
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
you were referring to so I can just go
 
06:10:06.510 --> 06:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
make a mark 6631 6631 that sounds
 
06:10:08.708 --> 06:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
familiar go ahead could we clarify the
 
06:10:10.350 --> 06:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
language then if that's what that's for
 
06:10:13.030 --> 06:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
instead of or their authorized agents
 
06:10:14.548 --> 06:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
because that sounds like you know it
 
06:10:16.390 --> 06:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
could be a federal contractor it sounds
 
06:10:18.628 --> 06:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
like that door could swing wide open so
 
06:10:20.590 --> 06:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
maybe we could just limit it to the need
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
that we're talking
 
06:10:26.708 --> 06:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
about and if I may very briefly
 
06:10:29.310 --> 06:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
um I very much care about the right to
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
privacy and there are certain legal
 
06:10:33.948 --> 06:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
doctrines that irk me to no end these
 
06:10:36.270 --> 06:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
days third party Doctrine don't get me
 
06:10:39.350 --> 06:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
started cuz we don't have an hour but in
 
06:10:41.990 --> 06:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
this case it would seem to me that since
 
06:10:44.590 --> 06:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the federal entity
 
06:10:47.868 --> 06:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
or their authorized agent not allowing
 
06:10:50.430 --> 06:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
to release to an authorized agent
 
06:10:52.310 --> 06:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
basically just means the federal entity
 
06:10:54.110 --> 06:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
can request the same data and then pass
 
06:10:56.270 --> 06:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
it along to their you know once we
 
06:10:58.350 --> 06:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
release it to a federal entity they are
 
06:11:00.708 --> 06:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
bound by their rules so as long as we're
 
06:11:03.788 --> 06:11:03.798 align:start position:0%
releasing it to them to me doesn't seem
 
06:11:05.708 --> 06:11:05.718 align:start position:0%
to create a much bigger problem because
 
06:11:08.468 --> 06:11:08.478 align:start position:0%
we release them to an authorized entity
 
06:11:11.628 --> 06:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
by a federal agency but this being said
 
06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
I would probably still be more
 
06:11:15.708 --> 06:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
comfortable if the policy committee
 
06:11:17.548 --> 06:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
would have an opportunity to look at it
 
06:11:19.590 --> 06:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
or because it does seem to be a policy
 
06:11:21.708 --> 06:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
question and you know our hands are full
 
06:11:23.910 --> 06:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
with the money God knows uh you know I
 
06:11:26.468 --> 06:11:26.478 align:start position:0%
don't want to miss an important detail
 
06:11:28.590 --> 06:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
because we are overwhelmed by the rest
 
06:11:31.750 --> 06:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
of our job so and we'll do that could
 
06:11:33.390 --> 06:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
you just put into writing what you said
 
06:11:35.628 --> 06:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
and send it to Mickey so we abely
 
06:11:38.430 --> 06:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely I can't keep in my head thank
 
06:11:41.708 --> 06:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
you no it's that
 
06:11:44.150 --> 06:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
I anything else from our committee
 
06:11:46.270 --> 06:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
anything else from you
 
06:11:49.548 --> 06:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
all I want to thank you for your time
 
06:11:53.708 --> 06:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
and um patience thank you for showing up
 
06:11:54.990 --> 06:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
I want to thank my
 
06:11:58.110 --> 06:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
team they are M they're awesome and so
 
06:12:00.548 --> 06:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
are you now this has been very helpful
 
06:12:02.430 --> 06:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and an excellent
 
06:12:05.390 --> 06:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
presentation and very well prepared
 
06:12:07.590 --> 06:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
really appreciate all the work that went
 
06:12:10.350 --> 06:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
into this very pleasant two plus hours
 
06:12:17.830 --> 06:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:24.868 --> 06:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:28.070 --> 06:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
puppy starting at
 
06:12:30.548 --> 06:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
9 so first all are we done we anything
 
06:12:35.670 --> 06:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
else we wanted to discuss okay so at uh
 
06:12:38.468 --> 06:12:38.478 align:start position:0%
311 I'll close the division 2 finance
 
06:12:38.478 --> 06:12:39.830 align:start position:0%
311 I'll close the division 2 finance
committee

06:12:39.830 --> 06:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
hearing you asking about Friday yeah
 
06:12:42.240 --> 06:12:48.548 align:start position:0%
hearing you asking about Friday yeah
just

06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:54.030 --> 06:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
Friday we play true with Transportation
 
06:12:56.830 --> 06:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
people bring the Hat go ahead you know
 
06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
