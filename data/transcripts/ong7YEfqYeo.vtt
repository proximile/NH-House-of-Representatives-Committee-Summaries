last night after I got home after I did
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
the snowblowing I checked my emails

you've all have a number of emails as
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%

that we have been assigned Friday the
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
fund there are a number of people who
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
have signed up on these bills with
 
00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:01.879 align:start position:0%
regard to 4 34 there are 21 people and

morning I'm Vanessa Sheen and I
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
represent Milford Hillsboro District
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
23 this bill that I'm introducing does
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
one thing only it prohibits direct
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
funding of abortions or the termination
 
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0%
of a pregnancy specifically it bars
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
public funds from being spent on
 
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.670 align:start position:0%
public funds from being spent on
abortions

00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
public schools from performing abortions
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
or providing medication that would
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
terminate a pregnancy or public
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
employees from performing abortions
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
within the scope of their employment
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
this bill has one exception however and
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's when the mother's life is
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
endangered this bill also prohibits
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
publicly uh funded referrals made to
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
facilitate an
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
abortion this bill is an administrative
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
measure only so therefore it has no
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
penalties and this bill is in no sense
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
about permitting or prohibiting
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
abortion this bill would not prohibit
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood or other
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that perform abortions
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
from receiving Public Funding for other
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
purposes and there's no argument to be
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
made that this bill would have some
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
detrimental impact on Women's Health
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
Care there's no reason not to pass this
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
bill unless the general court insists
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
that abortions be directly financed by
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers this is also Common Sense
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure the general Court's
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
budget prohibited State funding of
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
abortions in the fiscal Years 2012
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
through 2013 2018 through 2019 and 2020
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
through 2021 so this legislation would
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
make it unnecessary to continue
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
rehearsing that same provision and
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
please note I have submitted a proposed
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill which says that
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
it would not apply to abortions received
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
by Medicaid recipients under the state's
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plan this bill is a
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
housekeeping State matter and it is not
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
intended as a challenge to the federal
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid act I become aware that this
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
bill could be challenged if this is not
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
made clear and I believe the amendment
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
that I've proposed will resolve that and
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:46.839 align:start position:0%
testimony and the prime sponsor of House
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 596 was representative plet and is
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative plet available to testify
 
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.949 align:start position:0%
representative plet available to testify
this

00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
I do not see him on the attendee
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
list I am here
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes I'm I'm a member of the
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
audience and I had to unmute um thank
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
you I was was not aware of House Bill
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
434 when I put House Bill 596 fnn
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
they're both at this for the same
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
general purpose both laudable uh mine
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
goes a little further and it not only
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
Pro prohibits Public Funding of
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
abortions for convenience abortions only
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
not any other kind of abortion but also
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
creates a New Hampshire foster care and
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
adoption initiative fund um I think both
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
bills are laudable um the concern I I
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
was considering uh suggesting itl in
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
mind but as I thought more about it uh
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
the concern I have with HB 434 is a
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism is a concern and
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
there may be some concern about
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
constitutionality because of an Alaska
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
case and so I'm going to let this play
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
out and let the let the Judiciary
 
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
Committee come to a conclusion uh which
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
should Prevail thank

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
you representative Morgan um yes good
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
well you you're sounding good
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative PL my question is um
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
there's several um sections there which
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
deal with secular humanis gives what
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
um gives a definition of what secular
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
humanism is with no people who actually
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
consider secular humans would not agree
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
with any of it so what's the uh what how
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
why is that part of the bill in the bill
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure why it's why it's
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
necessary doesn't seem to complicate
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
things so um especially in um and it
 
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
also probably runs a foul of both
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutions but
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
anyway so why why is that necessary to
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
your bill say stuff about secular
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
humanists okay that language comes from
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court uh which defines
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
secular humanism that way and it's in
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
there so that uh people who were
 
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
espousing uh concerns about uh uh Public
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
Funding of convenience abortions I put
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%

concerning restrictions on

abortion now is a time to be expanding
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
access to healthcare our neighbors are
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
suffering and people are facing an
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
unprecedented housing and employment
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
crisis they do not need their rights
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
further jeopardized many facilities
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
which provide abortions provide other
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
medically necessary care and attempts to
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
liit limit Public Funding are well known
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
to be attempts to limit abortions and
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
have the collateral consequence of
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacting communities
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
of color members of the lgbtq community
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
and lowincome
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
individuals abortion is a medically
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
necessary option though some of the
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
legislation before you today makes an
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to distinguish between medically
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
necessary and other abortions this is an
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
extremely complex decision that each
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
pregnant person should be allowed to
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.149 align:start position:0%
pregnant person should be allowed to
make

00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
as a woman who was pregnant just over a
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
year ago it is a position of great
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and a time of great care
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
for the growing life inside of you no
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
pregnant person should face any barriers
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
in making a difficult decision that may
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
result from the significant condition of
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
being pregnant many complications to
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy are simply heartbreaking and
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
we do not need politicians in the room
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
shaming pregnant people for decisions
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
which result from any natural process
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
respect pregnant people people and their
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
full ability to make their own decisions
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
the complexity of these pieces of
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislation simply belies how this is
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
around best left to our private citizens
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%

going to focus on House Bill 434 in my
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
testimony today we oppose House Bill 434
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
for two reasons first we oppose this
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
bill because it seeks to prohibit the
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
use of Medicaid insurance from covering
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
abortion care this already does not
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire our state
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
already does not allow state Medicaid
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
insurance from going toward abortion
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
care and the H Amendment prohibits
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
Federal insurance from being used in any
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
way for abortion care in short patients
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
seeking an abortion must already pay for
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
their care out of pocket or use private
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
insurance that covers
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
abortion second we oppose this bill
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
because it would put in place a gag rule
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
on public colleges and University
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
campuses such as UNH this bill would ban
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees from funding on campus
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
health centers unless providers refuse
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
to make referrals for
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
abortion so what this bill does is
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
prohibit health clinics at our public
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities from providing
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
all options when patients face
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
unintended pregnancies including
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
information about or referrals for
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
abortion care this bill would prohibit
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
providers from giving their patients who
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
are our public college students the full
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
range of information that's a gag on
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
providers their alternative the position
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
this bill puts providers in is to offer
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
their patients all of the available
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
options but lose their funding in
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees and our state already
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
woefully underfunds higher
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
education this is an impossible and
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
unfair position to put our public
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities in and
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
extremely problematic when considering
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
Public Health wellness and safety for
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
our college students many of whom live
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
away from their childhood home and their
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%

Insurance relied on by individuals who
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
are struggling financially already does
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
not cover abortion care and our New
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public college and university
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
students should be able to trust that
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
their health centers on campus will
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
provide them complete and medically
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%

critical issues

issues my name is Moren money and I'm a

number 21 I'm a co-sponsor of House Bill
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
434 an act prohibiting the use of public
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
funds for abortion to be very clear I am
 
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
434 and I am only speaking this morning
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 430 for not any other
 
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.710 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 430 for not any other
proposed

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
legislation this bill PR places practice
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
into law since the New Hampshire state
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
budget has repeatedly not allocated
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
public funds toward
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
abortions this bill places that
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
consistent practice into law New
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of 15 states that has
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
no law clarifying this matter with
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
approximately 23 States prohibiting
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
direct funding for elective
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
abortions therefore inserting the
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
practice of prohibiting public funds
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
toward abortion into state law clarifies
 
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.710 align:start position:0%
toward abortion into state law clarifies
the

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
issue the Bill's findings cite a Supreme
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
Court case of rust versus
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
Sullivan in that case on a side note
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
Justice sudor New Hampshire's own cast
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
the deciding vote the US Supreme Court
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
made it clear that prohibiting public
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
funds toward abortion is
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
legal the majority on the court found
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
that not funding a previously determined
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
right does not prevent the right
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
itself or the right to express views on
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
it let's keep New Hampshire consistent
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
with practice I encourage you all to
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on House Bill
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
434 and I thank you again for your time
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
and attention that concludes my
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you are there any
 
00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
questions for representative B oh yes
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
representative mlan uh thank you Mr
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
Mooney for taking my question um one one
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
question or concern that was raised on a
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
similar Bill a few years back was let's
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
say that you had an individual um who
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
was incarcerated let's say for um a drug
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
offense so they're in jail and they
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
discover that they are pregnant and so
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
they want to exercise their right to an
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
abortion because of the ban in this bill
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
on facilities and the resources of the
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
State being involved the concern was how
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
could you transport that prisoner um to
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
the medical facility in order to get the
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
procedure since it would involve the the
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
resources of the state so under this
 
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.909 align:start position:0%
resources of the state so under this
bill

00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
434 how do you see that particular
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
scenario um being carried
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
out thank you for that
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
question uh that's not addressed
 
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.389 align:start position:0%
question uh that's not addressed
specifically

00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
certainly um I would find it hard
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
pressed to think that a a prisoner would
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
be diagnosed on the spot uh in their
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
prison for for for a procedure or what
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
have you so I would think that a
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
transportation to a medical
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
facility uh would certainly be in order
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
um whether or not uh a public fund would
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
be involved there I'm I'm unsure but I
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
would think that certainly uh the
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
transportation would not be um an issue
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
to give a prisoner proper
 
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.430 align:start position:0%
to give a prisoner proper
medical

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.950 align:start position:0%
medical
uh

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%

would prohibit the use of public funds
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
for abortions additionally it would deny
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
any public dollars from being used for
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%

and Care in the process of finding an
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
abortion provider I accidentally called
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
a Crisis Pregnancy Center which gave me
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
misinformation about abortion and
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
traumatized me I also needed to notify
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
my parents which was a scary process
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
even though they are
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
pro-choice ultimately I did I did get an
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
abortion my abortion allowed me to go to
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
college and then to graduate school to
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
receive a master's in education I've
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
been able to own a small business teach
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
yoga and become a state representative
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
it allowed me to have when I was ready a
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.549 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
off looks like she's
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
muted we we did you hear me speak at all
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
we we lost you after you were telling us
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
that you were able to have a child okay
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
thank you so it allowed me to have when
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
I was ready a child who is now six in
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
the love of my life I'm leading the life
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
I want to be leading and I firmly
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
believe none of these things could have
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
happened if I was unable to have an
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
abortion having an abortion literally
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
saved my life maybe not my physical life
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
but the quality of my life as a result I
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
am passionate about preserving and
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
expanding access to reproductive health
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
care I know firsthand how important
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
access to this care can be one of the
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
things I find extremely disturbing about
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
this bill which impedes reproductive
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
Health Care access is that it will
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
impact those who are already the most
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
marginalized and struggle to gain access
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
to care Young Folks low-income folks
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus folks and people of color
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
when public funds are limited the most
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
marginalized or impacted the most we
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
know that affluent white women will
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
always have access to reproductive
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care regardless of legal barriers
 
00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
sharing my own abortion story for years
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
hearing the stories of others I know one
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
thing is for sure reproductive
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is an intersectional issue
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
people of all economic classes races and
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
religion access abortion care legal
 
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
barriers to abortion will not stop
 
00:34:03.629 --> 00:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
abortions they will only keep the
 
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised folks from accessing the
 
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
care they need sometimes with deadly
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
results as legislators our goal should
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
be to expand access to care not to limit
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
it for these reasons I implore you to
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
vote against HB
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%

live in Le New Hampshire I'm speaking
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
against House Bill 434 today I oppose
 
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.790 align:start position:0%
against House Bill 434 today I oppose
this

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
bill HB 434 signed to prohibit the use
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Medicaid for abortion
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
care but that doesn't happen in
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Insurance already does
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
not cover abortion care furthermore the
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
height Amendment already bans the use of
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
federal insurance for abortion patients
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
getting abortion care have to use
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
private insurance if their plan covers
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
it or pay out of pocket thing is
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funded abortion care in the
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hamp New
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire another harmful piece of this
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
legislation would be to Institute a gag
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
rule on Healthcare Providers at New
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public colleges and
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
universities would prevent them from
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
providing all options to students
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
including referrals to for abortion care
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
for the state government to step into
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
the provider's office and dictate the
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
limits of patient care is wrong I care
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
for my patients best in evidence-based
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
practice and providing patients with all
 
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
of the facts I then allow my patients to
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
take make medical decisions for
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
themselves using my knowledge as a
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
resource But ultimately letting them
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
make decisions about their own bodies
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
hiding information from patients about
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
routine necessary reproductive health
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
care such as abortion care violates
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
medical ethics and it puts government
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
legislation in between the doctor
 
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:04.510 align:start position:0%
legislation in between the doctor
patient

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
relationship this relationship is
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
private it's based on trust and it
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
should be protected rather than
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
regulated the purpose of bill is to make
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
it harder for people to access routine
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care such as
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
abortion and it specifically targets
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
lowincome people college students people
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
of color and Rural people who already
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
face barriers um and difficulty
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
obtaining the healthcare that they need
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is wrong for the people of New
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
596 yesterday uh in the hearing for the
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
viability protection I ask you to
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
consider two
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
questions the first one is who is a
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
person and the second one is what
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
protections do those uh persons
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
deserve today now I ask you to consider
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
those questions from the perspective of
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of thousands of New
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents whose religious and
 
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
moral teachings tell them that abortion
 
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.109 align:start position:0%
moral teachings tell them that abortion
is

00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
wrong um the issue you have before you
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
today is not whether abortion is legal
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
but whether you want to Force other
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
people to support these with their tax
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
dollars I submit to you that that
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
forcing forcing people who are pro-life
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
to support abortion with their tax
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
dollars is no different from China that
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
forces Muslim Wagers to eat
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
pork or forcing anti-slavery
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
abolitionists to subsidize slavery
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
through the fugitive slave laws in other
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
words these are things that are
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
completely against our our moral and our
 
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
beliefs um these bills do not limit
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
abortion in any
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
way instead they instead all they do is
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
they say that we we won't use the common
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
tax dollars to support them for the many
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
for the many folks who are speaking in
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
favor or against this bill in favor of
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer subsidies um I would like to
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
refer them that there are several
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit abortion providers in New
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit Health policy and
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%

health care and to improve Health Equity
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
all across our state I have submitted
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony and I do I don't want
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
to repeat too much of what we've
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
included there but I do want to
 
00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
emphasize new future strong opposition
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
to both uh House Bill 434 and
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
596 parts of these bills including the
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
ban on Medicaid from covering abortion
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
services are redundant in unnecessary as
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
we've heard today moreover these bills
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
are harmful and threatened to severely
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
impact the health and wellness of our
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
state and our people we believe as has
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
been stated by others that reproductive
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
health is a key part of our system of
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
care and access to reproductive care and
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
counseling is critical to supporting the
 
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of our state into
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
the future this is certainly true for
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
the students who would be impacted by
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
the so called gag rule proposed under
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 434 if instituted this gag
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
rule would violate medical ethics and
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
standards of care and it would create a
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
wedge between a patient and healthc care
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
provider threatening to limit the care
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
available to students enrolled in our
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
public institutions at a time when they
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
need it most more broadly the
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
prohibitions proposed under these bills
 
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:46.839 align:start position:0%
threaten to undermine the long-term
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
health of our children and families
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
studies show studies from throughout the
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
country show that denial of abortion can
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
have significant Health social and
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
economic implications that can harm
 
00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
women and children for years uh as
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard today the decision to have
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
an abort abortion is already one of the
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
most difficult choices a woman in a
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
family will ever have to make to pass
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
these bills would just make that process
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
even more more traumatic and could have
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts on the health and
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
wellness of our family and our state so
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
we would ask you to uh vote both of
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
these bills and expedience to legislate
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
Daniel hello can you hear me we

00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
you for letting me testify for the house
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and opposition to
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
house bills 596 in 434 my name is Maddie
 
00:43:59.470 --> 00:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
Daniel and I'm actually testifying on
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
behalf of another one of the members of
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire High School Democrats
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
who is very passionate about this issue
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately could not be here
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
today in her testimony she writes the
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
following I am testifying in opposition
 
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
to HB 596 in 434 because as a woman who
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
was a Christian this bill opposes the
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state which is
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
something that has real value in
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
upholding The credibility of our New
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government I am aware that a
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
Christian should be considered pro life
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
since abortion is sinful rather though I
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
am pro-choice because I believe that
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
everyone regardless of their religion
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
gender race Etc should have affordable
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
access to this medical service based on
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
what I've heard abortion is never an
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
easy decision and from my experience not
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
one that a woman take slightly if a
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
woman is to make this decision they
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
should have access to the essential
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
services that are necessary in order to
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
access a safe and legal abortion it is
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
the right of public companies to do so
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
and provide these Services regardless of
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
their opinions on the issue and the same
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
goes for the government according to
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood abortion prices are
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
up to go up to $1,000 reason behind
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
getting an abortion are varied but all
 
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
are valid some factors that play into
 
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
such an important decision include your
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
health insurance your income and
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
financial support programs available in
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
your area the type of abortion you get
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
and how far along your pregnancy is
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
according to data gathered by AARP the
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
average health insurance cost for single
 
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
coverage premiums in 2020 is $388 per
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
month and the average New Hampshire
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
woman earns
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
$2,368 a month if a woman has to spend
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
$11,000 on an abortion in New Hampshire
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
and is making a minimum wage salary that
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
puts her with little other resources for
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
rent health care and other necessary
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
utilities I implore members to support
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
subsidized abortion and conceptive
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
services rather than allowing women to
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
struggle to pay for the treatment
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
themselves especially when their health
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
is on the line I would also like to add
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
that over 66% of New Hampshire adults
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
support abortion services and public
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
dollar should represent the interests of
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
the people now is the time to be
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
expanding Healthcare versus shutting it
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
down thank you for your time and I urge
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
please thank you very much for your
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
Walton thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas Walton I'm president of two
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
companies in Southern New Hampshire
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
which I started 25 years ago if I had to
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
do it again I would not start these
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
companies in New Hampshire for two
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
reasons the first reason is the the
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
total fertility rate in New Hampshire
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
now is the lowest in the country I think
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
only Vermont and the District of
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
Colombia have lower fertility rates
 
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
we're now at 1.5 and dropping not even
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
China has got that low China at its
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
lowest had a total fertility rate of 1.6
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
in 2000 uh they now are going up up as
 
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
their economy uh their Manufacturing
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
Powerhouse tends to
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
increase New Hampshire is continuing to
 
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:34.839 align:start position:0%
slip in this very low fertility rate how
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
company you know supposed to get their
 
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.470 align:start position:0%
company you know supposed to get their
future

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
employees with a total fertility rate
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
that low I for one am one of seven
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
children my mother and father under very
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh limited Circumstances had us mainly
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
as a loving sacrifice which is what
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
children are they're always a loving
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
sacrifice we were taught very well uh
 
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
and gained the ambition to do what we
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
did now to make companies like my own we
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
need to improve on our fertility rate
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's killing us New Hampshire and
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont and the District Columbia are
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
now lowest in the
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
country near lowest in the world we need
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
to improve for utility rates thank
 
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony today
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan did you have a
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
question sure yes thank you very much Mr
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
chair thank Mr Walton
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
um these two bills deal only with um
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
abortion except for a little thing about
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
foster children and Adoption Fund so
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
um this would probably be a very
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
different Bill and a different committee
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
but you support uh you have any
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
suggestions for things we can do to make
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
it easier for uh families to raise raise
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
children and to attract you know young
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
younger younger people of childbearing
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
here yes I realize for young people
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
especially young unmarried uh women
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
especially this is uh assaulting them at
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
the weakest points in their lives and in
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
that case
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
especially uh at adoption services uh
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
Foster uh foster parents they are always
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
available and as you know many are the
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
the the kindest and best parents that a
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
child could possibly have those types of
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
services are where we should be putting
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
most of our efforts in most case it
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
takes no effort it's a charitable
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
sacrifice of these adopted uh parents
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
and foster parents who are opening they
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
open their arms for these types of
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
children and this always there's always
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
a choice it's always better for the
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
mother no matter what circumstances
 
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.630 align:start position:0%
mother no matter what circumstances
they're

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
followup I just
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes um so do you have any suggestions on
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
what we do to make it easier for you
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
know the young women to actually and
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
they and the fathers of these babies
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
actually raise a child like they put
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
more money into child care for working
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
parents or PID family medical leave or
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
more money for education so you have any
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
suggestions while we're sitting here
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%

Juggernaut as I call it which is
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
destroyed politics in our
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
state the the changes have have just
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
gotten worse and worse uh the
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that China is an example
 
00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
has brought 800 million people out of
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
poverty with that manufacturing
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
Juggernaut is the same type of
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Juggernaut that Alexander
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hamilton used as a as an example to get
 
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
our economy and good jobs millions of
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
good jobs well-paying jobs that Inspire
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
families to to to sacrifice for their
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
their children because they know there's
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
there's a future there now some as you
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
well known as as you will know have
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
tried to reignite that manufacturing
 
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
Juggernaut which we need more than ever
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
right now and it's been put on temporary
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
delay for a couple years but believe me
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's coming back people know where where
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
where we lost out some 30 40 years ago
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
as manufacturing jobs got shipped
 
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:03.559 align:start position:0%
overseas but once they come back the
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%

Jeanie hesa and I'm the political
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
director for the American civil
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
liberties Union of New Hampshire I
 
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify to
 
00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to both HB 596 and
 
00:56:28.599 --> 00:56:30.029 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to both HB 596 and
HB

00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
434 in truth I struggle honestly to
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
comprehend HB 596 with its references to
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
quote nonsecular Shams non-controversial
 
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.710 align:start position:0%

transcultural

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
transcultural
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
morality and the offensive idea of a
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
quote convenience abortion this bill
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
garbles the law and wrongly asserts that
 
00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039 align:start position:0%
Public Funding for abortion violates the
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
First Amendment
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
public funds are used every day for
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
services and undertakings with which
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
members of the public disagree this
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
includes paying for war incarceration
 
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
and even vaccinations on which the
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
government is currently spending
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
billions without any infringement on the
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
First Amendment taxpayers do not get to
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
direct or restrict their tax payments
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
according to their beliefs if they did I
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
expect there are a number of federal
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
departments that would have
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
significantly fewer funds than they do
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
today on HB
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
434 this bill is Extreme as the prime
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor noted it includes a very narrow
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
exception for the physical health of the
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
pregnant person excluding coverage for
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
people who become pregnant due to rape
 
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
or incest and the narrow exception
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
excludes coverage for abortion Services
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
necessary for the emotional or
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
psychological health of the mother or
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
other health considerations as
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
determined by a doctor
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
I also want to be very clear that HB 434
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
would have little to no impact on people
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
with financial
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
means this bill instead takes direct aim
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
at marginalized people it discriminates
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
against low income individuals and
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
singles them out by denying them Medical
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
Care Public Funding restrictions leave
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
some people little choice but to use
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
money they need for food rent clothing
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
or other necessities to pay for an
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
abortion moreover many low-income people
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
are forced to delay their abortions in
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
an effort to save up the money needed
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
for the medical care increasing their
 
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
medical risks additionally we share the
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
previous concerns expressed about how
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
this bill would impose a gag rule on
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
public institutions of Higher Learning
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
by prohibiting them from using any
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
tuition or fees to make even a referral
 
00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.190 align:start position:0%
tuition or fees to make even a referral
for

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
abortion I will submit my testimony in
 
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000 align:start position:0%

inspected by the Department of Health it
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
is in this legislator's best interest to

in New Hampshire that serves the
 
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680 align:start position:0%

every human
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
person New Hampshire has consistently
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
withheld public funds for from abortion
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
and should continue to do so because
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is not a disease cured by
 
01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
abortion if your Healthcare kills people
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
on purpose you're doing it wrong in

passage of House Bill 434 and 596 and to
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
continue the legacy of funding life
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%

Pinto good morning thank you all for
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
having me uh my name is Josie Pinto I
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
live in Dober and I'm here on behalf of
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
myself this morning to express my
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to both of these bills I want
 
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that we do not need
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
this bill as it currently stands here in
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we do not have Public
 
01:02:57.789 --> 01:02:57.799 align:start position:0%
Funding for abortions if we did I
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had to have countless
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
phone calls with patients who have no
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
idea how they're going to pay for their
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
abortion when I previously worked at one
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's abortion providers
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
those calls broke my heart and they
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
committed me to a lifelong fight of
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
insuring abortions remain accessible I'm
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
actually in full support of Public
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
Funding of abortions it should not be
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
the one medical procedure where patients
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
are told they can't receive funding if
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
they're on Medicaid when many private
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
insurances do cover it this is blatant
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination of those facing the
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
challenge of already being in poverty
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
many of whom are already parents Studies
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
have shown that nearly 40% of people
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
cannot cover a sudden $400 expense which
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
is exactly what an abortion is for many
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
people if not more than that people
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
deserve the care they need regardless of
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
their ability to pay parenting should be
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
a choice that people make when it's
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
right for them not something they're
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
forced into when money is already tight
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
lastly as a young person who is suppor
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
reported friends getting abortions
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
during my time in college I believe we
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
need to work to expand abortion access
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
for college students not provide
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary gag
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
rules uh thank you so much for hearing
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
me today I really really encourage you
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
to vote itl on both of these bills and
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions for
 
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.269 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions for
Miss

01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
Pinto seeing none thank you for your
 
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.109 align:start position:0%
Pinto seeing none thank you for your
testimony

01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
Spencer

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
hello um thank you Mr chair for taking
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
my testimony today and thank you to the
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
members of this committee uh my name is
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
Louise Spencer I live in conquer and I
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
am speaking on my own behalf today
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
opposing both of these bills and urging
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
uh the committee to vote this uh both of
 
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
itl um I will defer much of what I was
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to say because because uh we heard
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
such excellent testimony today from
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
others who are opposed to these bills I
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
just would like to highlight the concern
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
about the gag rule and the fact that um
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
this will seriously
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
impact the ability of students at
 
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
particularly at public universities to
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
have full and complete information
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
regarding the range of Medical Services
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
is that are available to them should
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
they uh find themselves facing a
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
pregnancy that they had not uh planned
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
on this is particularly concerning when
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
we look at the numbers of rapes at on
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
college campuses we know that you know
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
at a minimum it's 133% of women have uh
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
conveyed that they have experienced a
 
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
sexual assault or rape
 
01:05:59.309 --> 01:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
while at college and it is in one recent
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
study as high as one in Four Women uh
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
the fact that someone could experience
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
this sort of trauma and not be able to
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
get access to the full range of
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
information needed to determine how to
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
move forward is particularly
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
disturbing uh when you consider that
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
that information may be limited by a
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
woman's ability to to pay to have the
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
financial resources to get information I
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
was struck by the last um witness
 
01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
testifying in favor of the bill um it
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
seems to me quite unfair that money can
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
be spent at clinics that provide only
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
partial information to patients and yet
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
cannot be spent at clinics that provide
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
women with the full range of choices
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
that are legal and should be available
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
to them um so with that I would just
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
once again reiterate my strong um
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
request that both of these bills be ited
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
um and I would just say that I I find it
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
disingenuous when I hear um from a
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor of a bill that this is not about
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
limiting abortion I think it's better
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
when we are clear about what we really
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
are intending to do here and that we
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
address that issue right out in the open
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
and not claim that we are only trying to
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
prevent public dollars from being spent
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
on abortions um so thank you very much
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
Spencer see none again thank you for
 
01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.870 align:start position:0%
Spencer see none again thank you for
testifying

testifying
 
01:07:55.269 --> 01:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
today that um with regard to those who
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
have pre-registered we only have three
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
more people who have in fact
 
01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.029 align:start position:0%
more people who have in fact
pre-registered

01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
pre-registered
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%

01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
testify hi thank you um good morning my
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
name is Stephanie George I live in do
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where I'm calling from
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
today and I'm here to voice my
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.430 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
596

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
596
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
abortion is a safe and legal medical
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
procedure and in 1973 it was ruled that
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
a pregnant woman has the Liberty to
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
choose an abortion without excessive
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
government restriction I cannot perceive
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 596 as anything other than
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
excessive government restriction every
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
person ought to be able to get the
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
health care they need including abortion
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
based on what's best for their unique
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
needs not politics but bills like House
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 5
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
966 seek to put up Financial barriers
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
between an individual and their
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
doctor however we feel personally about
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
abortion politicians should not be
 
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to deny health coverage to an
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
individual just because they're poor

of House Bill 434 but submit and and
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
those that Prov provideed it submit that
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
the uh constitutionality of 596 is uh
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
reflects what article six of the New
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution requires as well
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
as the um First Amendment of the United
 
01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
as the um First Amendment of the United
States

01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution basically uh House Bill 596
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
is predicated on the idea that when
 
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
someone says that life doesn't begin a
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
conception that abortion isn't a world
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
that it's not um murder those are a
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
series of unproven faith-based
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
assumptions and necked assertions that
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
are implicitly religious and inseparably
 
01:12:32.669 --> 01:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
linked to the religion of secular
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
humanism the Supreme Court starting in
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
Tazo versus Watkins followed by Seager
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
followed by the wells case just about
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
every single federal court of appeals
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
has found that secular humanism is a
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
religion for the purpose of the First
 
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment including The Establishment
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
Clause The Establishment Clause is the
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
provision of the first amendment that
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
prohibits the government from entangling
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
itself with a religious ideology it
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of a a lot of religious
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
Faith to believe that convenience
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
abortion practices aren't modern day
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
child sacrific on the altar of
 
01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
convenience so basically what 596 is
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
saying is it saying this it's saying
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
pursuant to article six of the New
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution as well as the
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
first amendment Establishment Clause of
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
the United States Constitution the state
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire whether anyone
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of anyone's emotional
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
feelings is prohibited from
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
appropriating a penny of public state or
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
federal taxpayer dollars to convenience
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
abortions convenience abortions involves
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
abortions that don't involve incest or
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
um when the mother's lives in danger
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
because that appropriation is not fails
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
what's called prongs one and three of
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
the Limon test the Limon test is a test
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
used we use in federal district court to
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not government
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
action violates The Establishment Clause
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
if Government action fails one prong of
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
lemon is unconstitutional that
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation fails at least two prongs
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
of lemon because number one it lacks a
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
primary secular purpose it is a sham it
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
is basically advancing modern day child
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
sacrifice onone the the alar of
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
convenience I know other people feel
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh but we're not really trying
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
to prove or disprove whether or not life
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
begins at conception we're just saying
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
that it's dispro it's not proven
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
therefore it falls within this the
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of The Establishment Clause
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
and then thirdly secondly it constitutes
 
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
what's called an excessive entanglement
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
with the religion of secular humanism so
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the legal framework
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
behind the bill that we've written out
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
of an enormous about a multi-state
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
federal litigation but let me make the
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
argument for House Bill 596 in plain
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
English basically the way this bill is
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
going is it says in every District in
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
this state whether it's blue or red
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
there is at least one taxpayer who
 
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
sincerely believes that abortion
 
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
practices are immoral and it also
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
follows that they believe that to enable
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
acts of immorality is itself an act of
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
immorality and
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
therefore according to this bill this
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
state is proh must be prohibited from
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
appropriating public funds to
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
convenience abortion providers because
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
it causes it coer ly causes those
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to violate their own
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
conscience by the simple Act of paying
 
01:14:59.709 --> 01:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
taxes it's an evil that article six of
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution as well
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
as the first amendment Establishment
 
01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
Clause of the United States Constitution
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
was designed to prohibit so now let me
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
quickly just address the differences
 
01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
between 493 and and 596 the enforcement
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of 596 are vastly superior uh
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they allow taxpayers to have
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
standing to bring a lawsuit where they
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
can have seek attorneys fees and they
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
can seek adjunctive relief to stop State
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
actor from appropriating public funds to
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
convenience abortion providers it also
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
creates what's called adoption and
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
Foster Care initiative fund and um which
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
where public funds money that otherwise
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
would have gone to convenience abortion
 
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
providers can go to that fund and
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
moreover if an abortion provider is fine
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
the the state legislature would have the
 
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put money in that fund
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
because adoption funding and Foster Care
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
funding are secular in nature Mr SE I
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to cut you off but we do have
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
a three minute limit on test yes sir and
 
01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
then um that that I can I can stop with
 
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
that if you'd like me to I'd be welcome
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions any of the
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
members might have well just one one
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
question for me and that is your
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
argument seems to be quite complex so I
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
guess I would ask whether or not you
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%

about that is it we is that you have
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
submitted it or is there some
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
organization there's def fact there's
 
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
about there's about eight organizations
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
signed under to that there's deao
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General there's special forces
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
of Liberty there's several different
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
ministers to just to name some of the
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
different ones there's Garden State
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
families there's another thing to say is
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
that multitudes of other states are
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
running the language of 596 they passed
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
some general provision they reflect
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
anyway so yeah that's yes yes M Mr
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
chairman that's we submitted WR
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Simpson did you
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
question you're
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
muted thank you I I do I had two but you
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
asked one already so um the other one uh
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
sorry it went by so
 
01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.390 align:start position:0%
sorry it went by so
fast

01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
um okay I think what I'm trying to ask
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
is um you just mentioned in 596 is in a
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
lot of other states and I'm just
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
wondering if the if you can point us to
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere for more information on that
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
and where that is when we go to study
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
before we vote and then um the F my the
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
second part of that is did you help
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
write 596 is that one of the things that
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
your groups do well so in the N case
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're Federal litigators who are lawyers
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
that know just enough to be dangerous on
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
any topic but we do follow a lot of
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
federal lawsuit in the instant case here
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
president Trump withheld $60 million
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
that would have otherwise gone through
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
title 10 to plan Parenthood our team
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
moved to intervene in that case it was
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
California versus HHS really versus the
 
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
Trump Administration it's from that
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
fighting that a lot of the language
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
emerged but there's a Ser there's a m
 
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
there's multitudes of cases that have
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
been filed on different topics where the
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
language has been written we would
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully submit that really it's the
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
advice and suggestions of kind of the
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
originalist judges who've made different
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
statements that were were basically the
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
primary off of the bill we kind of
 
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
assembled some of that language but uh
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
it was put together um by a numerous
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional law professors is federal
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
litigators and uh just to you know just
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
to reflect what the Constitution
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
requires the important thing to note is
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
that the bill it narrowly deals with
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether the Constitution and in of New
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and whether the state the
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution allows Republic
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
funds to go to convenience abortion
 
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
providers it has nothing to do with
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
limiting at the time of abortion not
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
fetal heartbeat paying capable or none
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
nothing like that so there's the answer
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
to that and in terms of the other other
 
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
question about other people who were uh
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill there's
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ben in South Carolina
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
who's introduced the bill I can't
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
remember the bill number I think it's
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
3508 it's h358 but I can get that
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
information but it's representative
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
Bennett the representative Samson in
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
Maine is carrying the bill uh
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative um assemblyman o in New
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is carrying the bill um and
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
then I'm just trying to think of groups
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
near it's assembly men D Petro in New
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
York uh it would be representative
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
Reagan in Tennessee it'd be Senator
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
Carlin in Iowa it'd be representative
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
Leaf in Oregon it'd be representative
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
Clifford in Washington there's a lot I
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
could keep going but I mean the point is
 
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
is that multitudes of states are are
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
basically amending what is 434 and again
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
we we really respect those people behind
 
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
that bill and appreciate appreciate that
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
and we would it you know respectfully
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
request that the submit committee vote
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
in favor of both of those bills but we
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
definitely favor 596 because a lot of
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
other states are amending a general pro
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
prohibition against public funds going
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
into conveni abortion providers and are
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
using this new language so sorry yes sir
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair representative Alexander
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
did you have a
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
question um yeah two Mr Sheriff um
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me um um thank you for
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking my questions um first of all I'm
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
wondering so this seems like it's a
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
national effort I'm wondering
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
specifically are you a New Hampshire
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
resident and then my second question is
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
are you currently a practicing attorney
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
so the answer is that say I'm currently
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
a practicing attorney lead counsel in a
 
01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:27.639 align:start position:0%
few cases in federal district court
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
right now uh
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
secondly the United States is a
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic New Hampshire is
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
part of the con is part of that
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic New Hampshire is
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
required to obey the Federal
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution representative pleats Bill
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
596 reflects what the First Amendment of
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
the United States Constitution requires
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
basically the argument is that nobody in
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire no taxpayers want their
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
money go that are that oppose abortion
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
or believe that it's murder do they
 
01:20:58.030 --> 01:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
don't want their money taxpayer dollars
 
01:20:59.790 --> 01:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
going to convenience abortion providers
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
because it causes taxpayers to feel like
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
they have blood on their hands so we're
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
not saying you can't have an abortion
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
you can have it you just have to pay for
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
it for it yourself and so I think you
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
answered the
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
question that was asked I did I answer
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
it I did not I a lawyer sorry so
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
basically I you know I we spent a lot of
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
time in New Hampshire we work with a lot
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
of groups in New Hampshire there's a lot
 
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
of pastors and groups in New Hampshire
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
that are not subject matter experts on
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional jurist prudence and so
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
they've asked us to help with this and
 
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
so as advocates we are representing some
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
of those kind of individual pastors
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
individual church members and so forth
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
Christine wheel is a colleague of mine
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%

01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960 align:start position:0%

01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that might not you know I
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%

01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
law school was a Judge Advocate General
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%

rever Alexander's questions and I think
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
he also answered the question that I
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
asked representative plet uh it seems
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
like many years ago but now hour and a
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
half ago so I'm all set thanks okay
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Langley
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative Langley did you have a
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
question I did thank you Mr chair could
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
you you you have used the term
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
frequently convenience abortion could
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
you help me understand who determines
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's a convenience or not is
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
that the physician the individual the
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
clinic um who who decides whether the
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
abortion is convenient or not uh yes
 
01:22:59.709 --> 01:22:59.719 align:start position:0%
representative basically convenience
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
abortion is just a term of art it also
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
could be referred to as a
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
non-therapeutic abortion sometimes in
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
court we call it an elective abortion
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just it's just a scenario
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
where you know someone's been has a
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and they they just want to get
 
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
rid of it you know that that's there's a
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
distinction we we we the bill rep draws
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
a distinction between what's called a
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
secular abortion and a nonsecular
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
abortion secular abortion is basically
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
you know if the mother's Liv's in danger
 
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
if it's the product of rape or if it's
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
the product of incest there's legal
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
principles that kick in like the
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
transferred right of self-defense the
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
right of self-defense for a mother if
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
she was dying and it was the choice
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
between her or the child she could you
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
know make that decision to abort the
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
child and the state could fund an
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
abortion practice like that the state
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
could fun fund an abortion practice if
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
it was the productive rape if there was
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
a police report involved that's a major
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
difference with the distinction versus
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
just someone who has a baby gets
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
pregnant and wants to abort it again
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people who have
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
testified today who really believe that
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
those practices constitutes a for that
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
or immoral and more likely than not
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
might be murder and they just don't want
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
to have anything to do with that and so
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's the difference with the
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
distinction between a secular abortion
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
and a non-secular abortion the question
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
presented for for the members here is
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not such an
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation would be a secular
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation or nonsecular
 
01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
representative PL section of the bill
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
that deals with adoption and Foster Care
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
deals with those would be a secular
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
Appropriations because states have
 
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
compelling interest to do things like
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
aold Community standards of decency and
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
to not promote Lous and the
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation towards abortion promotes
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
licentiousness and erods Comm Community
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
stands of decency those are difference
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
with distinctions yes ma'am
 
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your response are
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%

members thank you for your time today my
 
01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
name is Alyssa Antman I'm in conquered
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm speaking on behalf
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
of myself and my younger sister Talia
 
01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
Antman who could not share her testimony
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to HB 434 I've also
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
submitted this as written testimony as
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you yeah um Talia is an
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
incredibly bright full-time student
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
studying social work at the University
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and is working two jobs
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
to help pay for her education she cannot
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
testify today because she's currently
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
working a shift right now because our
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
parents are small business owners and
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare for dependents is cost
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
prohibitive talia's health insurance and
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
Health Services are directly through UNH
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
here is her testimony quote campus
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
health services are the only accessible
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
providers for me and students like me HP
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
434 would adversely and directly impact
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
those of us who are college students at
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
public universities who rely on these
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
Health Services on campus by instituting
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
a gag rule on Healthcare this gag roll
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
would prevent our oncampus providers
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
from explaining all reproductive Health
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
Options to us including information
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
about or referrals for abortion care
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
when I go to the Health Center at UNH I
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
need to be able to trust that I'm given
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
complete medically accurate information
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
especially during this pandemic as
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is even harder to access I
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
rely on this care more than ever and
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
need to know all of my options
 
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
I strongly oppose HP 434 as it
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
interferes with the relationship I have
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
with my doctor and the care I receive at
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
un end quote I stand with my sister and
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
other college students at public
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities as an alumnist
 
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
of unh Healthcare Services on campus
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
were vital to me especially knowing all
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
of my reproductive Healthcare options as
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
an older sister I want Talia to have
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
access to that same level of care I
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge you to vote against HP
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%

here
 
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
here
today

01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
AER hello Mr chairman can you hear me we
 
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
can thank you very much my name is uh
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
Christopher Ager I'm from Amhurst New
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing my myself and I
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
support House Bill
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
434 and oppose House Bill
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
596 I think that's a reasonable approach
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
for the committee to take my primary
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
concern is um taxpayer funding uh for a
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
procedure that many of us believe um is
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
is a violation of our conscience and I
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
also have one anecdote of a woman who
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
was pressured to have an abortion and it
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
was made on her we never want to see
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
that happen um but again my primary
 
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
concern is support for 434 and not
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
forcing people of conscience to pay for
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
something they believe is is morally
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you very much and thank you
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
for all the work that you do on the
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%

needy and poor I represent not only the

pro-life Community but many churches I
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
represent girls who have been pressured
 
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
into abortion I'm sanctity and value of
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
life is important and as you can tell my
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
voice is a little shaky and that is
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
because this is so personal to me and I
 
01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
am so passionate to fight for baby
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
helpless baby
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
all of my life until the day I die I say
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
you want to take a baby's life hit me
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
first because I am here for children
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
next I'd like to say I'm in support of
 
01:30:05.239 --> 01:30:06.350 align:start position:0%
next I'd like to say I'm in support of
HB

01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
596 the reason why I'm in support of
 
01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:13.830 align:start position:0%
596 the reason why I'm in support of
these

01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
bills is
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
because first of all it's
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
immoral it's immoral to kill a baby and
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
I believe believe the state has an
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
obligation when it comes to the bottom
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
line to fight for life um and if you do
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
not support this you are also guilty of
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
murder so I'm just going to say that for
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
today thank
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you for your testimony
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from Miss
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
May seeing none move on to our next
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman can you hear me
 
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
we can thank you Ian hwit appearing on
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of Cornerstone and my testimony
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
this morning is limited to house bill
 
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.070 align:start position:0%
this morning is limited to house bill
for

01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
434 Cornerstone supports 434 together
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
with representative xen's proposed
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
amendment the bill codifies that state
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
funds won't be used to directly Finance
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
or promote abortion at the same time the
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment will prevent the bill
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
from inviting an abstract legal fight
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
like the one that occurred in the
 
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case Dalton against Little
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
Rock Family Planning overall the Bill's
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
text means that New Hampshire will
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
refrain from funding abortion to the
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
extent permitted by federal law I
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
believe most of the people who
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
criticized for 434 this morning um did
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
not hear representative Sheen statement
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
about her proposed amendment but some of
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
the other two criticisms that we heard
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
that were recurring were first that the
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to prevent something that
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
isn't happening and second that the Bill
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
acts as a gag order on public
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
institutions by denying funds for
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
abortion so the first point is actually
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
consistent with representative shien's
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
stated goals for the bill she seeks only
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
to prevent abortion from being publicly
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
funded but the second point I think
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
misconceives what the US Constitution
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
requires um and anecdotally just because
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer and I'm interested in
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
challenging the government sometimes
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
I'll have um parents will approach me
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and they'll express interest in suing
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
their school district because they
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
perceive that there's Progressive
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
political bias in the district's
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum and whenever this happens I
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
always have to explain that political
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
bias in the government's messaging is
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
not a legal cause of action the Supreme
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
Court pointed out in Rust against
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
Sullivan when Congress established the
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
National Endowment for democracy quote
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
it was not constitutionally required to
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
fund a program to encourage competing
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
lines of political philosophy unquote so
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
the government's free constitutionally
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
to adopt a particular message and it
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
can't coer us into espousing that
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
message but it does not need to directly
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
subsidize speech that it disagrees with
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
and for exactly the same reasons it's
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
not required to subsidize either
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
abortion or abortion referrals even
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
though both of those things are legally
 
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
protected by constitutional uh case law
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
in Rust which is a case that attorney
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
Mooney also mentioned the Supreme Court
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
directly considered whether the
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
government could refuse to fund abortion
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
referrals as part of its title 10
 
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
program the court appell the regulations
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
prohibiting funding of those referrals
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
saying that they did not quote Force the
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
title 10 grantee to give up abortion
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
related speech they merely required that
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
the grantee keep such activities
 
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:41.560 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct from publicly
 
01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.550 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct from publicly
funded

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
activities and exactly the same thing is
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
true of this bill this bill only directs
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
how the government's money is spent and
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
it does not place a gag order on anyone
 
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is a common sense extension of
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
the general Court's budgetary practices
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
in multiple fiscal years as
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative Gan pointed out and I'm
 
01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
either the bill as a whole or the
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment are there any
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%

you great so good morning committee

members thank you for your time today
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
and for hearing my testimony my name is
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
Olivia balabanis I'm a student at UNH
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking in opposition to HB
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
434 this is an extreme bill that impedes
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care access for
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
public colleges and
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
universities as a college student I know
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
that my peers who rely most on this care
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
will be most negatively impacted by this
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
poor legislation our UNH Health and
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
Wellness Center is the only accessible
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
health care provider for many students
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
living on and around campus myself
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
included students already facing immense
 
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
challenges especially during a pandemic
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
will be most affected including those
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
with low income lgbtq plus individuals
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
and students of color during a time
 
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
where Healthcare is more difficult to
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
access this bill would even further harm
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
students by taking that care away as a
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
college student living in New Hampshire
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
full-time through throughout the year
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
health and wellness at UNH is the only
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
way I can access Affordable Health Care
 
01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
along with many of my peers and
 
01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
especially since both my parents are
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
small business owners my health
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
insurance is never really guaranteed I
 
01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
visited the healthc Care Center on
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
campus for a variety of reasons
 
01:35:39.629 --> 01:35:39.639 align:start position:0%
throughout my nearly three years here as
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
a student and each time has more than
 
01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:44.679 align:start position:0%
exceeded expectations I trust that the
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurses who have cared for me
 
01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
there gave me accurate and thorough
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
information including medications and
 
01:35:50.639 --> 01:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
information including medications and
referrals

01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
referrals
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
if HB 434 is passed the trust the
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
wellness center has established with
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
every student on campus would be
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
diminished diminished especially when it
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
comes to reproductive Health Care since
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
medical professionals would no longer be
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
able to relay every option available to
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
patients at no fault of their own but
 
01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
rather at the fault of government
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
interference my peers and I deserve the
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
right to accurate and thorough health
 
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
care and this should not be impeded upon
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
by the views of certain politicians I
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
ask that you oppose house B 434 thank
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
Banis seeing none again thank you for
 
01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.550 align:start position:0%
Banis seeing none again thank you for
your

01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
testimony just for the committee sake I
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
would ordinarily take a break right now
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
but we have just three other people who
 
01:36:42.189 --> 01:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
have signed up and rather than take a
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
break now I just assume get those done
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
and then we can have a long lunch hour
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
if that's okay with
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair thank you and thank you
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee members for taking
 
01:37:06.189 --> 01:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
my testimony today I'm Walt Stapleton a
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative from Claremont ward 3
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County District 5 and I am in
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
support of both 434 and
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
596 the state has a reasonable valid and
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
lawful interest in protecting life and
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
the well-being of its citizens including
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
the pre-born as future functioning
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
citizens so it follows that the state
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
should not fund what is adverse to its
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
interests um the interests of the state
 
01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:43.159 align:start position:0%
are clear in both the constitution of
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
the state in um article two natural
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
rights all men have certain natural
 
01:37:52.589 --> 01:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights among
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
which are the enjoying and defending
 
01:37:59.709 --> 01:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
life and Liberty and so forth and then
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
again in
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
RSA um
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
32941 at Roman 1 nothing in this
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall be construed as
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
creating or recognizing a right to
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
abortion Roman two it is not the
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
intention of this subdivision to make
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
lawful an abortion that is currently
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
unlawful a HB
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
596 um is especially interesting because
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
it Fosters adoption and adoption is a
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
good alternative to abortion and
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
coincides with the public interest the
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
state has in protecting and fostering
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
life several testimonies have referred
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
to the federal hide Amendment as already
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
covering the matter uh there for making
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
this these bills
 
01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:56.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessary however with the change of
 
01:38:56.679 --> 01:38:58.070 align:start position:0%
unnecessary however with the change of
presidential

01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
presidential
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
Administration the Biden Administration
 
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
has already signaled the end of the
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
Mexico City policy and indicated
 
01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
overturn avoiding of the Hide Amendment
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
so that leaves it squarely in the realm
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
of the states for uh the protections of
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money uh against the use by
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
abortion and thank you that is that
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
concludes my
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%

my daughter allowed me to become the
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
adult I am today at the age of
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
27 having my daughter is what pushed me
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
to get my GED and go on to college at 16
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
yeah um good uh morning Representatives
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
um my name is Leia Cohen I'm a resident
 
01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
of molten Boro um I was not planning on
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
testifying this morning um so I do not
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
have written testimony but I've been
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
listening to today's hearings all
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
morning and I am absolutely outraged as
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
a resident of New Hampshire abortion is
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
Health Care this is not an opinion it is
 
01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
an indisputable fact the attempts to
 
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
restrict access to healthcare amidst a p
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic a widespread economic recession
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
in which immense numbers of your
 
01:41:58.109 --> 01:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
constituents are losing their jobs and
 
01:41:59.950 --> 01:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
therefore their employment sponsored
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
Healthcare are short-sighted at best and
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
immoral and cruel at worst and I
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
especially find the notion of a
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
convenience abortion offensive is the
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
removal of your appendix a convenience
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
operation are the antibiotics you take
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
for strep throat convenience medications
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
would intubations to treat covid-19 be a
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
convenience treatment therefore I
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
strongly urge the committee to vote
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
these bills in expedient to legislate
 
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
and instead redirect your focus into
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
making Health Care More accessible for
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
the vulnerable vulnerable people you
 
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
were elected to serve We Trust our
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
public officials to look out for our
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
best interests and ensure our access to
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
the highest possible quality of life
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
reported using emergency contraception
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
because of fear of method failure and
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
half because they had unprotected sex it

could not access emergency contraception

who was using a condom and the condom
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%

01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
you always will live with the regret
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a baby that you lost with
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
abortion um we talked about other
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
Solutions um I know for me starting off
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
with very low income it was Wick
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid food stamps food pantries um
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
all the resources in the community to
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
give life and now I give back to the
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
community um the hide Amendment with
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
President Biden we're looking at that
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
being overturned and I just want want to
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
add in in my the reason why I raised my
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
hand was I had a question for somebody
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
but we are you know using very deceptive
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
language this is not a blob of tissue um
 
01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
this is not just our body there is a
 
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
baby involved there is personhood there
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
is somebody else so I I mean I could go
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
on and on which I won't but I really
 
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
feel this is um murder and what we need
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
to do is educate girls and really help
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
them understand this and as they hit
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
Womanhood a lot of times they hit
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder uh this
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
damages the mother daughter connection
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
as many mothers um and parents force
 
01:52:04.589 --> 01:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
their daughters into abortion um
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
thinking it's for their best and those
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
Generations are just destroyed so there
 
01:52:14.669 --> 01:52:14.679 align:start position:0%
is no future economic um future without
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation okay thank you for
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
letting me speak
 
01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
today ml you
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you Mr chair I was
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could indulge me I just
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
had a followup question for uh attorney
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
Ian huitt um if if it's possible I might
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
be able to ask that thank you for your
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
May uh representative mlan has indicated
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
that he has a question which he would
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
like to ask Ian hu and so we'll call
 
01:52:48.669 --> 01:52:48.679 align:start position:0%
upon Mr hwit if he's still available to
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
respond to the question
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
good morning yes I'm available to take
 
01:52:55.229 --> 01:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
your question thank you Mr chair and and
 
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um attorney hwit for indulging
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
me your testimony is always very dense
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
so it sometimes takes a little time for
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
me to process so yeah you testified that
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
there really was no gag order in this
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation and I just want you to
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
clarify for me then um uh if I look at
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
the bill 132 colon 47 when it talks
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
about the public facilities assets for
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
abortion prohibited and it when it says
 
01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
that those facilities cannot be used for
 
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of providing performing or
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
participating so I just I just wanted to
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
be clear as to what your argument was
 
01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
with respect to that provision of the
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
bill well if your suggestion
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative is that participating
 
01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
could be construed to Encompass
 
01:53:50.109 --> 01:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
referrals and then that's therefore gag
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
order um or maybe some kind of
 
01:53:54.589 --> 01:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional condition I I don't
 
01:53:57.069 --> 01:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
think that any courts likely to construe
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the bill that way if this bill came
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
before a court because the word referral
 
01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
is used in other context okay so you
 
01:54:06.430 --> 01:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
know courts will assume that legislators
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
chose with care the words included in
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
the statute and since referral is used
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
in other places to refer to like the
 
01:54:16.750 --> 01:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
verbal Act of referring for an abortion
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think participate is likely to
 
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
be given that a broad construction as
 
01:54:24.189 --> 01:54:24.199 align:start position:0%
encompassing a a verbal referral that
 
01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
would include some sort of physical
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
contribution to the actual Act of an
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
abortion thank you very
 
01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
much thank you for
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
Mr with that I see no other hands and I
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
will close that
 
01:54:46.069 --> 01:54:46.079 align:start position:0%

01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%

the thank you Mr chairman I wish I was
 
04:01:36.590 --> 04:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
we were all back in the lb I remember
 
04:01:40.110 --> 04:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
sitting in uh judici year years ago a
 
04:01:45.229 --> 04:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
few uh at any rate uh HB 233 is nothing
 
04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
more than guaranteeing that a child who
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
is born alive regardless of the of the
 
04:01:57.070 --> 04:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances actually gets treatment I
 
04:01:59.830 --> 04:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
had previously sent out some counters to
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
arguments that a that never happens and
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
no there's no such thing as but in fact
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
this is a guarantee
 
04:02:13.229 --> 04:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
in law that when a child is born they
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
are going to receive
 
04:02:20.830 --> 04:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
care nothing more and certainly nothing
 
04:02:22.870 --> 04:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
less if a
 
04:02:22.880 --> 04:02:24.389 align:start position:0%
less if a
child

04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
by the grace of God survives an
 
04:02:34.630 --> 04:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.750 --> 04:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
live in the literature that I sent out
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
04:02:42.030 --> 04:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
earlier there were descriptions of
 
04:02:45.870 --> 04:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
children being left to wither and die
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
without any assistance I find that
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
nothing less than
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
fanticide this bill has nothing to do
 
04:02:58.149 --> 04:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
with a woman's choice
 
04:03:02.110 --> 04:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
to uh have an abortion that's should be
 
04:03:05.710 --> 04:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
addressed separately but it does deal
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
with whether or not a child who
 
04:03:13.229 --> 04:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
survives should be guaranteed the right
 
04:03:13.239 --> 04:03:14.149 align:start position:0%
survives should be guaranteed the right
to

04:03:14.149 --> 04:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
live and that's something I think we all
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:27.309 --> 04:03:27.319 align:start position:0%

233 several States uh let me identify
 
04:04:24.510 --> 04:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
myself I am a a representative from
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
Claremont ward 3 Sullivan County
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
District 5 Walter
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
stable several States recently removed
 
04:04:36.189 --> 04:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
all abortion restrictions up to the time
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
of birth and tentatively even
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
Beyond New York Virginia Vermont maybe
 
04:04:45.359 --> 04:04:46.590 align:start position:0%
Beyond New York Virginia Vermont maybe
some

04:04:46.590 --> 04:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
others so if abortion goes wrong or is
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
incomplete and the fetus survives the
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
procedure then with these states somehow
 
04:05:02.750 --> 04:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
its life is in Jeopardy outside the
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
womb hence the need for a viability Pro
 
04:05:12.389 --> 04:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
PRP ion and this bill to afford Express
 
04:05:16.269 --> 04:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
protection of that born emerging
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
life this bill is in the reasonable and
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
valid interest of the state to protect
 
04:05:23.950 --> 04:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
the life of its
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
citizens matured unborn
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%

me hello good afternoon thank you for
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify my name is Dr
 
04:06:32.110 --> 04:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
Julia me I'm a medical doctor I'm an
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
OBGYN I live in Lebanon and I practice
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I'm
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:46.990 --> 04:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
233 excuse me House Bill 233 the
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
so-called born alive bill is disguised
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
as a means of abortion restriction it's
 
04:06:54.510 --> 04:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
written with purposefully confusing
 
04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
misleading and medically inaccurate
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
language this bill seeks to regulate a
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
non-occurrence and to criminalize
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
something that does not happen speaking
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
as a doctor all doctors and medical
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
providers have an obligation to provide
 
04:07:11.710 --> 04:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate Medical Care based on
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
evidence and the standard of care to all
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
patients unfortunately this bill would
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
have real consequences for patients and
 
04:07:22.269 --> 04:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
their families who find themselves in
 
04:07:24.189 --> 04:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
difficult and tragic situations through
 
04:07:25.710 --> 04:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
no fault of their
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
own families were forced to go through
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
what no one should have to very early
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
labor in the death of a previable infant
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
meaning a baby who is born before it is
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
able to survive survive outside the
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
womb I have unfortunately seen these
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
situations many times in my job most
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
recently I'll tell you all about a story
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
a patient that I'll call
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
Holly um Holly had already had several
 
04:07:52.510 --> 04:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
miscarriages in the early second
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
trimester babies who are born too early
 
04:07:58.429 --> 04:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
to survive she came in and she very
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
strongly wanted to be a mom she um was
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
really eager to start her family with
 
04:08:05.199 --> 04:08:06.189 align:start position:0%
really eager to start her family with
her

04:08:06.189 --> 04:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:08:09.070 --> 04:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
partner she was about 18 weeks along
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
which is about 4 and a half months
 
04:08:12.830 --> 04:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
pregnant um in the early second
 
04:08:14.990 --> 04:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
trimester and she went into early labor
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately she was admitted to the
 
04:08:18.750 --> 04:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
hospital and we performed a procedure
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
meant to keep her pregnant longer we
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
actually sewed the opening to her uterus
 
04:08:25.309 --> 04:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
closed with a stitch it's called a
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
cirage and it's meant to prolong her
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and allow her baby a longer
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
time to grow inside the uterus
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately her water broke a few days
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
later and she um went into labor and
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
delivered her daughter shortly
 
04:08:43.389 --> 04:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
afterwards at this tational age there
 
04:08:45.389 --> 04:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
are no medical interventions that could
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
have saved her daughter or prolonged her
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
life performing procedures such as
 
04:08:52.149 --> 04:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
inserting breathing tubes and IVs would
 
04:08:54.429 --> 04:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
have kept Holly from spending whatever
 
04:08:57.309 --> 04:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
moments she had with her daughter the
 
04:08:59.429 --> 04:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
so-called born alive Bill ignores
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
medical realities it fails to
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the real life experiences of
 
04:09:06.189 --> 04:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
families who are facing unimaginable
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
loss this bill would force medical
 
04:09:11.229 --> 04:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
intervention even when doing so would be
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
fule it forces families to have to un
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
have to undergo brutal invasive
 
04:09:18.510 --> 04:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
resuscitations and interventions instead
 
04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
of holding their babies for their last
 
04:09:23.149 --> 04:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
few hours of Life Healthcare decision
 
04:09:25.229 --> 04:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
should be made by women in consultation
 
04:09:27.109 --> 04:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
with their loved ones and doctors
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
including Specialists like Obstetricians
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
and neonatologists who are specialized
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
pediatricians dealing with very early
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
babies not by politicians or legislators
 
04:09:40.030 --> 04:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I urge you to please
 
04:09:43.469 --> 04:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 233 thank
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there any questions
 
04:09:48.670 --> 04:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
for Dr
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
me okay representative
 
04:09:53.830 --> 04:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
oper so Dr me you say that the
 
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
interventions were will
 
04:09:59.790 --> 04:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
beutal and the baby couldn't
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
survive not quite understanding how this
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
bill would actually Supply in that
 
04:10:08.510 --> 04:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
situation I wouldn't think that it would
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
I mean the child is born but if it
 
04:10:15.389 --> 04:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
then you uh help me out that
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's exactly right um there
 
04:10:25.950 --> 04:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
are babies that are born that in which
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's no um chance of survival
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
and um there is no reason to perform
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
interventions on these babies um it
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
really only seeks to to harm harm them
 
04:10:40.670 --> 04:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
in their final moments of life and and
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
also it's I think it's harmful to
 
04:10:44.429 --> 04:10:44.439 align:start position:0%
families to have to see that when really
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
most people would want to hold their
 
04:10:46.800 --> 04:10:47.990 align:start position:0%
most people would want to hold their
baby

04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
baby
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
more yes could follow up so
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
care you don't think that care is
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate how is it required by the
 
04:11:06.359 --> 04:11:12.990 align:start position:0%
appropriate how is it required by the
bill

04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:16.269 --> 04:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.800 --> 04:11:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
me

04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.920 --> 04:11:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.990 --> 04:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think this bill would offer
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for women to have a
 
04:11:35.710 --> 04:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
choice whether they would want
 
04:11:41.790 --> 04:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:41.800 --> 04:11:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair and
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor for taking my question
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
um my question comes from um your
 
04:11:53.309 --> 04:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
statement about how the bill has
 
04:11:55.950 --> 04:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
medically inaccurate language I guess
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of looking at section two it
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
says born alive the actual language um
 
04:12:04.030 --> 04:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
is the complete expulsion or extraction
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
for the mother of human infant at any
 
04:12:08.189 --> 04:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
stage of development who after expulsion
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
or extraction breathes has a beating
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
heart or has a definite movement of
 
04:12:12.239 --> 04:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
heart or has a definite movement of
voluntary

04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
muscles what is inaccurate about that or
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
or what what else needs to be included
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:29.149 --> 04:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
accurate um I think that there are uh
 
04:12:33.149 --> 04:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
situations in in babies's Born right at
 
04:12:34.830 --> 04:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
the cusp of
 
04:12:37.630 --> 04:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
viability um meaning right around the
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
age when when maybe some babies would
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
survive certainly some other babies
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
would not and I think had it
 
04:12:48.109 --> 04:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that everyone should be
 
04:12:50.670 --> 04:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
forced to undergo resuscitation of a
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
viability Mr chair just to followup if I
 
04:13:01.630 --> 04:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
could um I'm wondering doctor what
 
04:13:03.309 --> 04:13:03.319 align:start position:0%
additional language would need to be
 
04:13:06.550 --> 04:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
included that would help specify what
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
the cusp of viability is in which um
 
04:13:13.109 --> 04:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
recess or or um preserving the life
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.670 --> 04:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah I think that this is um a
 
04:13:21.870 --> 04:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
difficult question we don't have a
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
medical definition um every situation is
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
different and that's why I think that
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
experts should um make a decision about
 
04:13:34.149 --> 04:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
what there is no defined age of
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
viability um thus it doesn't need to be
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
Bill you're the expert that's why I was
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
asking you thank
 
04:13:49.710 --> 04:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
questions see that thank you again Dr
 
04:13:58.109 --> 04:13:58.119 align:start position:0%
me and the next person to uh actually
 
04:13:59.870 --> 04:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the next person to testify is
 
04:13:59.880 --> 04:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
yeah the next person to testify is
Christopher

04:14:01.990 --> 04:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
Christopher
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:16.349 align:start position:0%
 
available

04:14:16.349 --> 04:14:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.640 --> 04:14:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:14:34.830 --> 04:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
unmute I'm sorry technical problems can
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
you hear me now hear you now yeah thank
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman and the
 
04:14:46.229 --> 04:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
committee for this opportunity for to
 
04:14:48.389 --> 04:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
testify I'm a
 
04:14:51.229 --> 04:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
neonatologist and I live in Handover and
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire uh and uh I
 
04:15:02.790 --> 04:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
like to me uh the reasons why I uh would
 
04:15:05.349 --> 04:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
object to this bill are are sort of
 
04:15:09.550 --> 04:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
twofold I I I think like the prior
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
speaker there are many instances where
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
babies are born and are living but
 
04:15:21.750 --> 04:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're uh they they do are not able to
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
survive so I think this bill uh in in my
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
estimation the warning about uh
 
04:15:33.750 --> 04:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate Medical Care and the other
 
04:15:37.109 --> 04:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
warning is inherently ambiguous and I
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
worry about while I understand the
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
sentiment behind it I worry about the
 
04:15:46.309 --> 04:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
intent to legislate what really is a
 
04:15:46.319 --> 04:15:48.269 align:start position:0%
intent to legislate what really is a
personal

04:15:48.269 --> 04:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
personal
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
decision on the part of the parents and
 
04:15:55.229 --> 04:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
their caregivers around what is uh the
 
04:15:59.870 --> 04:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to offer for a baby in
 
04:15:59.880 --> 04:16:00.870 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to offer for a baby in
this

04:16:00.870 --> 04:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:16:04.269 --> 04:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
condition some of these uh infants are
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
as previously noted uh extremely mature
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
infants at the edge of viability but uh
 
04:16:12.750 --> 04:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
this uh bill would
 
04:16:17.229 --> 04:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
also I think uh unreasonably Encompass
 
04:16:20.349 --> 04:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
infants who have uh who are born later
 
04:16:24.990 --> 04:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
in gestation but have uh conditions that
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
are uniformly fatal early in life and
 
04:16:33.710 --> 04:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
for whom uh instituting medical support
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
has no hope of helping them ultimately
 
04:16:42.109 --> 04:16:42.119 align:start position:0%
and only um causes them to experience
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
pain or
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
discomfort so I think
 
04:16:49.389 --> 04:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
basically uh
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
the the attempt to legislate what really
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.149 --> 04:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
incorrect thank you are are there any
 
04:17:03.469 --> 04:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.590 --> 04:17:05.600 align:start position:0%

04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
of Dr to say that I oppose House Bill
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
233 based on the fact that I think it's
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary misleading and is unable to
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
adequately address ambiguity in a
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
particularly challenging um period of
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
time in infants lives I I don't think
 
04:18:34.149 --> 04:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
this bill has anything to do with how
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
abortion care actually works and is
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
based on these false claims and similar
 
04:18:39.389 --> 04:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
to what Dr me and Dr Ringer have
 
04:18:41.790 --> 04:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned I do believe this bill has
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
clear consequences for um previable and
 
04:18:48.990 --> 04:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
potentially later term infants who are
 
04:18:51.790 --> 04:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
born with conditions that do not make
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
them able to
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
survive um every situation is different
 
04:18:59.710 --> 04:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
um but similar to to the other doctor's
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
testimony there are situations in which
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
um we cannot save the life of a fetus
 
04:19:08.429 --> 04:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
and I I would just like to reiterate how
 
04:19:11.590 --> 04:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
painful and um heart-wrenching it is to
 
04:19:13.950 --> 04:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
take care of these families these
 
04:19:16.830 --> 04:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
desperate situations when an infant has
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
a medical condition that is futile and
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
not able to be salvaged um passage of
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
this bill could potentially mean that
 
04:19:26.189 --> 04:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
those infants with only a few moments or
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
hours or even days to live and no hope
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
of meaningful life would be taken out of
 
04:19:32.590 --> 04:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
the arms of their parents and forced to
 
04:19:34.349 --> 04:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
go through painful unnecessary and
 
04:19:36.030 --> 04:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
feudal medical procedures that would
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
only prolong
 
04:19:39.870 --> 04:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
suffering um if you've ever witnessed a
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
loved one perhaps a beloved parent or a
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
grandparent who has undergone CPR or
 
04:19:46.429 --> 04:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
aggressive medical interventions at the
 
04:19:48.109 --> 04:19:48.119 align:start position:0%
end of their life you know that this can
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
be traumatizing and painful um the
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
entire field of hospice care originated
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
from a desire to provide compassionate
 
04:19:56.670 --> 04:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
end of life care to those with terminal
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um while people don't often
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
think that that may happen to to infants
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
it can um when I took an oath to become
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
a doctor I swore that I would do no harm
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
to my patients and I worry that this
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
bill could um could encourage the
 
04:20:16.510 --> 04:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
possibility that providers would feel
 
04:20:19.109 --> 04:20:19.119 align:start position:0%
it's necessary to inflict suffering on
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
infants that are born without a hope for
 
04:20:23.109 --> 04:20:23.119 align:start position:0%
survival because of the threat of
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
criminalization I do feel that um this
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
bill reveals the consistent strategy of
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
anti-abortion politicians whose ultimate
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
goal is to ban all abortions um without
 
04:20:36.510 --> 04:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
consideration of that ambiguity um and
 
04:20:41.149 --> 04:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
and without without uh the grayness that
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes comes with these periods of
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
time um in medical
 
04:20:48.910 --> 04:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
situations from a medical perspective um
 
04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this is something
 
04:20:52.149 --> 04:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
that should be placed in the legislature
 
04:20:54.189 --> 04:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
but rather left up to medical
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
professionals ethics committees and
 
04:20:59.550 --> 04:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
parents to uh to make decisions about
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
what's best for their family um I would
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge this committee to
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%

members um I'd like to point out that in
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
this in this bill and in this debate
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's no debate about the humanity of
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
these children um these are children who
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
have taken a breath who who have have
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
completely separated from their mothers
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
um and I and I'd like to suggest that
 
04:22:48.030 --> 04:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
this is there's no greatness in this
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
area like was suggested by the previous
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
speaker um I'd like to read to you
 
04:22:55.109 --> 04:22:55.119 align:start position:0%
article a portion of article two of the
 
04:22:57.429 --> 04:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:23:00.189 --> 04:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution and it
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
states um that all men have certain
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent rights
 
04:23:08.910 --> 04:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
among which are the enjoying and
 
04:23:10.750 --> 04:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
defending life and
 
04:23:12.870 --> 04:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
Liberty and so I'd like to I'd like to
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
submit to you that as the as the
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
representatives of the people um who
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
represent our government this is table
 
04:23:21.790 --> 04:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
Stakes for you um defending defending
 
04:23:24.429 --> 04:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
the the life and Liberty of those who
 
04:23:28.750 --> 04:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
are born is is just is is the is the
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
basic essence of what your job is and
 
04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm actually sad to have to speak on
 
04:23:35.309 --> 04:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
this bill um because I'm sad that these
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
protections aren't there already
 
04:23:39.950 --> 04:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
um one thing I'd like to point out is
 
04:23:41.710 --> 04:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
that the interests of those in in the
 
04:23:44.990 --> 04:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
room um if a if a child is born this way
 
04:23:47.149 --> 04:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
may not align with the interests of the
 
04:23:50.109 --> 04:23:50.119 align:start position:0%
child one of those parties is was paid
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
to to end its
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
life um and and those part and and those
 
04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
parties are the ones that are testifying
 
04:23:59.309 --> 04:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
to you to say that this isn't a problem
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a there's a
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest here and and
 
04:24:04.950 --> 04:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
if the uh taking care of the child is is
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
a concern Hampshire has Safe Haven laws
 
04:24:11.469 --> 04:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
that allow the mother to relinquish um
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh responsibilities for their child to
 
04:24:13.920 --> 04:24:15.469 align:start position:0%
uh responsibilities for their child to
the

04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
state in terms of whether this can
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
happen it does there's evidence of this
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
um gnell kerm goell who was an an
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
abortion provider in in in Philadelphia
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
was convicted of snapping the necks of
 
04:24:31.550 --> 04:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
of a couple of different babies who were
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
born this way according to the loer
 
04:24:36.630 --> 04:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
Institute which was quoting from public
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
records of the CDC in Florida uh 11
 
04:24:42.030 --> 04:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
babies were born alive from an abortion
 
04:24:45.070 --> 04:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
in 2017 in Florida and they also found
 
04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
that there were at least 143 babies who
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
died after
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
abortions um this is based on CDC data
 
04:24:56.349 --> 04:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
between 200 2003 2014 and the CDC
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
data says itself that it underestimates
 
04:25:03.309 --> 04:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
it so uh with that I would love to take
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
any questions thank
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
Oregon thank you very much Mr chair and
 
04:25:13.389 --> 04:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
thank you much Mr Hennessy um I just
 
04:25:15.910 --> 04:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
using expression that wasn't really
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with which was called table
 
04:25:20.590 --> 04:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
stakes and um far as know that is
 
04:25:22.510 --> 04:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
something that's the term from like
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
poker and I'm not sure exactly so what
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
what does it mean in this context and U
 
04:25:31.630 --> 04:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
how in might also address why a poker
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
game is analogous to the decision of H
 
04:25:37.149 --> 04:25:37.159 align:start position:0%

basics of what you do um you know it's
 
04:25:51.790 --> 04:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
hard to it's hard to think of ourselves
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
as being a free society that um ensures
 
04:25:57.550 --> 04:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
the natural right to life if we don't if

gray hair in the building I am a family

medic medicine physician that has been
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for almost 20 years uh
 
04:26:42.670 --> 04:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
I was pre I work in the Southern Tier as
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh previously the immediate P president
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%

04:26:47.670 --> 04:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
family medicine and I would like to
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to do
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
testimony today and I hope that you're
 
04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
all feeling and doing well if covid has
 
04:26:55.990 --> 04:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
taught me anything in uh this year and
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
almost a half a million deaths it has
 
04:27:00.189 --> 04:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
reminded me that sometimes no matter how
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
hard we try no matter what we do we
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
cannot save everyone and that sometimes
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the process of trying to save someone
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
we can strip them of their dignity and
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
their Humanity the bill this bill House
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 233 strips the Dignity of the
 
04:27:18.870 --> 04:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
family and the mother and the physician
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
and the family and people taking care of
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
them New Hampshire can do better I have
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
lived here for most of my life and
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that we have done a good
 
04:27:30.550 --> 04:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
job in trying not to get between
 
04:27:32.309 --> 04:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
patients and
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
Physicians this removes the decision of
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
the family when there's a pregnancy
 
04:27:37.790 --> 04:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
where we know the child will not survive
 
04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
instead of having time to hold the
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
infant process the grief we'll be
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
ripping that child from the hands of the
 
04:27:46.750 --> 04:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
family to do invasive painful fruitless
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
procedures because someone and in all
 
04:27:51.670 --> 04:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
respect to all of you who has never had
 
04:27:55.469 --> 04:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
to intubate do CPR resuscitate an infant
 
04:27:58.389 --> 04:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
is telling us what we have to do it
 
04:27:59.950 --> 04:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
removes the right of the parents and the
 
04:28:01.349 --> 04:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
physician to do what's right for the
 
04:28:03.670 --> 04:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
family and the patient providers know
 
04:28:06.670 --> 04:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
how to take care of patients legislation
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
is not intended to come between you and
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
your doctor but it
 
04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
can would we remove the right of a
 
04:28:15.189 --> 04:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
patient dying of terminal cancer not to
 
04:28:17.389 --> 04:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
be resuscitated I'm sure everyone here
 
04:28:19.630 --> 04:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
has had a family member who has had
 
04:28:22.870 --> 04:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
terminal cancer or something we know we
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
can no longer cure or
 
04:28:27.630 --> 04:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
treat do we trust that doctor and the
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
family and the patient to know what's
 
04:28:31.149 --> 04:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
best for the patient or do we legislate
 
04:28:34.149 --> 04:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
that they must continue to resuscitate
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
do we ask a physician to break every
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
every rib shove a tube down the throat
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
of your parents or your grandparents
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
who've asked for the dignity to die
 
04:28:44.590 --> 04:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
naturally this is no different it's not
 
04:28:46.870 --> 04:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
often that Physicians agree I firmly say
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
that you can't get more than two doctors
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
to order pizza and that's only because
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
half and half and anybody who's ever
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
gone to a specialist and then another
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
specialist and then another specialist
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
will tell you we never agree on anything
 
04:29:02.109 --> 04:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
however here are the following medical
 
04:29:05.469 --> 04:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
societies who feel that this bill in its
 
04:29:09.070 --> 04:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
form form is a bad idea that it is not
 
04:29:12.030 --> 04:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
doing what is right for the patient and
 
04:29:13.830 --> 04:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
anyone who's ever known me will know
 
04:29:18.030 --> 04:29:18.040 align:start position:0%

thousands of Physicians who can't ever
 
04:29:44.670 --> 04:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
agree on ordering pizza at lunch when we
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
used to have to do it for covid prior to
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
that that should mean something to you
 
04:29:53.710 --> 04:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
that should tell you something this body
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
has already rejected the previous Bill
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
last year HB 1675 only a year ago
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
because it's dangerous and misleading it
 
04:30:03.309 --> 04:30:03.319 align:start position:0%
has real life consequences and I put to
 
04:30:04.950 --> 04:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
you that the reason so many of these
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
Physicians and and I I appreciate Mr
 
04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
Hennessy's testimony but I have had to
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
be there with a mother who's lost her
 
04:30:14.429 --> 04:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
child who has creedu shot or tricomi 18
 
04:30:16.389 --> 04:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
who will live for a half an hour or an
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
hour but will live no longer who
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
surfactant in their lung is not allowing
 
04:30:22.590 --> 04:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
them to Breathe No Matter What tube we
 
04:30:23.590 --> 04:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
put them
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
in the last time I did that was 21 years
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
ago and I remember it to the
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
day it means something when your
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
provider and you have the right to
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
decide what is right for you and your
 
04:30:35.279 --> 04:30:36.590 align:start position:0%
decide what is right for you and your
family

04:30:36.590 --> 04:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:30:39.389 --> 04:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think this bill is good for New
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't think this bill is
 
04:30:42.910 --> 04:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
good for patients I don't think this
 
04:30:45.309 --> 04:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
bill is good for parents and and and
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
although Mr Hennessy states that
 
04:30:48.670 --> 04:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
everyone here that there who's
 
04:30:51.030 --> 04:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
testifying I have never once in my life
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
performed that procedure but I know what
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
right for my patients I know this bill
 
04:30:59.070 --> 04:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
is not right for my patients and I urge
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
you to reconsider or to think hard about
 
04:31:04.590 --> 04:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and think not just about that
 
04:31:06.510 --> 04:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
baby but about what that means later on
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
for your families and your parents and
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
their rights to
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
choose Thank you thank you are there any

R this bill HB 233 as I read it suggests
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
that Physicians do not always provide
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate care for a baby and in
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
particular aive viable

04:33:52.109 --> 04:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
untrue and frankly it's
 
04:33:55.750 --> 04:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
offensive this legislation is an effort
 
04:33:58.830 --> 04:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
or is an affront to all of us who care
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
for pregnant women and their babies we
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
do not need a state law to assure that
 
04:34:10.750 --> 04:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doctors render care to a

live viable newborn in every
 
04:34:18.750 --> 04:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
case this bill perpetuates the false
 
04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
notion that there are late term
 
04:34:24.510 --> 04:34:24.520 align:start position:0%

04:34:28.109 --> 04:34:28.119 align:start position:0%

04:34:29.910 --> 04:34:29.920 align:start position:0%

04:34:35.310 --> 04:34:35.320 align:start position:0%

04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
Unit this law would have us treating
 
04:34:59.230 --> 04:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
these babies with interventions that
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%
prolong their lives and suffering and

04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%

the rest of our lives to care for our

reasonable environment in which to
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%

233 as the sponsors of this bill noted
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about
 
04:40:18.550 --> 04:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
abortion this bill is about an impacts
 
04:40:19.948 --> 04:40:19.958 align:start position:0%
end of life
 
04:40:22.430 --> 04:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
care I don't think I'm the only one I'm
 
04:40:25.868 --> 04:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
guessing I'm not the only one um in this
 
04:40:29.230 --> 04:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
virtual room who has been in the very
 
04:40:32.550 --> 04:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
difficult situation of watching a loved
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
one survive on life support
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
their life is being
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
preserved but at what cost I know
 
04:40:44.510 --> 04:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself I watched a loved
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
one wither away on life support wishing
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
every single day that I could take him
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
off of it but I didn't have that
 
04:40:58.830 --> 04:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
power anyone who has had to make that
 
04:40:58.840 --> 04:40:59.990 align:start position:0%
power anyone who has had to make that
impossible

04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
decision of when to take a loved one off
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
life support knows how excruciating
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
those decisions are and knows how there
 
04:41:10.750 --> 04:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
is no one-sized fits-all decision for
 
04:41:12.550 --> 04:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
all end of life
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
scenarios this bill is about these
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
impossible decisions where an infant has
 
04:41:21.070 --> 04:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
only hours or days to live and a family
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
must decide how to spend the little time
 
04:41:25.830 --> 04:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
they have left with their
 
04:41:29.310 --> 04:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
child HB 233 would deny parents the
 
04:41:31.868 --> 04:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
ability to choose the type of
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care that works for their
 
04:41:35.948 --> 04:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
family and their faith in these
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
situations as we would allow them to do
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
at any other point in their child's life
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
if a child were dying at the age of one
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
five or even six months we would
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
entirely trust the parents in
 
04:41:51.788 --> 04:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
consultation with their doctor to make
 
04:41:53.310 --> 04:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
the best decision regarding
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care for their
 
04:41:58.990 --> 04:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
child I don't think I'm wrong to say
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
that no politician would dare insert
 
04:42:05.230 --> 04:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
their own judgment into that situation
 
04:42:06.990 --> 04:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
and yet this bill says parents and
 
04:42:09.550 --> 04:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
doctors cannot be trusted in just such
 
04:42:12.390 --> 04:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
an endof life decision merely because of
 
04:42:14.190 --> 04:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
when the tragedy is
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
happening there may be medical
 
04:42:18.910 --> 04:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
procedures that could quote preserve the
 
04:42:22.510 --> 04:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
life of an infant but for how long
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
preserve it for five minutes for an
 
04:42:29.910 --> 04:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
hour to at what cost at how much pain to
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
that infant to the family if this bill
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
becomes law Dr would be forced to
 
04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
deviate from their best medical judgment
 
04:42:40.750 --> 04:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
and administer painful treatments to
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
infants knowing that the infants don't
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
have the chance at
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
survival and put in treatment that would
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
be against the wishes of the
 
04:42:54.070 --> 04:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
parents rather than relying on their
 
04:42:56.070 --> 04:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
training and expertise to care for a
 
04:42:58.750 --> 04:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
dying infant doctors would have to take
 
04:43:01.628 --> 04:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
direction from politicians to avoid
 
04:43:01.638 --> 04:43:02.830 align:start position:0%
direction from politicians to avoid
criminal

04:43:02.830 --> 04:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
liability this bill removes all
 
04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
decision-making power from parents and
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
instead forces doctors to subject a
 
04:43:12.990 --> 04:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
dying infant to futile medical
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
procedures these end of life decisions
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
are hard they're hard if the person is
 
04:43:21.150 --> 04:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of their long and beautiful
 
04:43:24.510 --> 04:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
life and these decisions are hard for a
 
04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
baby who's been in this world for two
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
minutes but legislation like this does
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
not help we should trust doctors and
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
Trust amilies and allow families to make
 
04:43:39.310 --> 04:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
these decisions according to their faith
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
and what works best for their
 
04:43:44.350 --> 04:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
families I will submit my written
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
testimony uh but for these reasons the
 
04:43:49.470 --> 04:43:49.480 align:start position:0%

Kayla

04:44:49.470 --> 04:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
Montgomery hi uh good afternoon
 
04:44:53.030 --> 04:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
honorable chairman members of the House
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee my name is Kayla
 
04:44:56.230 --> 04:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
Montgomery I'm the director of public
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
affairs for plan parent in New Hampshire
 
04:44:59.470 --> 04:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
action fund plan parent from Northern
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
New England and we oppose House Bill 233
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
and I have submitted written testimony
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
um so I want to do this in two parts
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
today I want to talk first about why
 
04:45:09.310 --> 04:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is wrong and then I want to
 
04:45:10.948 --> 04:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
talk about some of the unintended
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
consequences of this bill um so to begin
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
the the title and the concept of this
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
bill is clearly intended to be
 
04:45:21.150 --> 04:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
inflammatory it implies and the sponsors
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
also implied that doctors are committing
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
infanticide to be clear this is illegal
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
it is not happening in New Hampshire and
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
as already noted it is extremely
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
offensive to healthc Care Professionals
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
who work to help people every single day
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
and regardless of some things that you
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
might have heard today infants born are
 
04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
currently protected under New
 
04:45:43.470 --> 04:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's criminal statutes that is a
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
fact doctors are obligated to provide
 
04:45:48.590 --> 04:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate Medical Care and to suggest
 
04:45:51.310 --> 04:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise is false offensive and
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
dangerous um someone previously Mr
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
Hennessy brought up the Kermit gnell
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
case I just I wanted to flag that gnell
 
04:46:03.708 --> 04:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh is a murderer he is in jail for life
 
04:46:03.718 --> 04:46:04.830 align:start position:0%
uh is a murderer he is in jail for life
for

04:46:04.830 --> 04:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
and we all agree with
 
04:46:10.708 --> 04:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
that so um I want to talk a little bit
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
about the the extreme consequences of
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and whether they're intended
 
04:46:18.750 --> 04:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
or not this is what this bill actually
 
04:46:22.628 --> 04:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
does so as we've gone over a few times
 
04:46:24.750 --> 04:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
every pregnancy and every situation is
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
unique but this is a bill about early
 
04:46:29.070 --> 04:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
labor and not about abortion so we're
 
04:46:30.990 --> 04:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
talking about this point in pregnancy
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
which is generally towards the end of
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
the second trimester we're talking about
 
04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
these much-wanted pregnancies when
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
families are desperate to leave the
 
04:46:41.230 --> 04:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
hospital with a
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
newborn doctors involved in these cases
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
are working to save lives both of the
 
04:46:48.750 --> 04:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant person and of the
 
04:46:51.628 --> 04:46:51.638 align:start position:0%
infant so this is this incredibly
 
04:46:53.830 --> 04:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate space where families are
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
faced with these complicated and tragic
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
decisions regarding to these pregnancy
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
complications or early labor or a fatal
 
04:47:04.750 --> 04:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
fetal diagnosis
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
when a pregnant person has a serious
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
health complication that puts her life
 
04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
in risk or she goes into early labor the
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
standard of care is always to care for
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
the pregnant person and the infant we
 
04:47:16.750 --> 04:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
have heard
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
this additionally there are some
 
04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
complicated circumstances where an
 
04:47:23.470 --> 04:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
infant might be born prematurely or have
 
04:47:26.910 --> 04:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
health issues that are so severe for
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
example a lack of a brain or a lack of
 
04:47:32.830 --> 04:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
lungs that sometimes in these extreme
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
cases the most approp riate Medical Care
 
04:47:38.110 --> 04:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
is comfort care and involved in the
 
04:47:40.750 --> 04:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
situation always our Advanced Medical
 
04:47:42.548 --> 04:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
Teams some of whom we've heard from
 
04:47:44.590 --> 04:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
today who have several different
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
Specialties including neonatal
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
Specialists the real danger of this bill
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
is that it restricts and it dictates the
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
standard of care in these incredibly
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
complicated circumstances and it
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
interferes with the doctor's ability to
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
provide the most appropriate care for
 
04:48:04.350 --> 04:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
the family and it does so under the
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
threat of Crim criminal
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
penalties so the passage of this bill
 
04:48:11.070 --> 04:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
could dictate how parents get to spend
 
04:48:13.548 --> 04:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
the last few days or hours with their
 
04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
babies before they pass this bill
 
04:48:19.948 --> 04:48:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
grieve I will conclude but just by
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
um I encourage this community to think
 
04:48:28.270 --> 04:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
about the families in these
 
04:48:28.280 --> 04:48:30.110 align:start position:0%
about the families in these
heartbreaking

04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking
 
04:48:33.270 --> 04:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
situations and please don't take the
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
worst possible day of a parent's life
 
04:48:37.230 --> 04:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
and make it even worse by requiring
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
treatments that simply can't work just
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday in this committee we heard a
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
very tragic story okay um in some this
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
bill is not needed in New Hampshire and
 
04:48:48.670 --> 04:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time we urge you to
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%

04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%

04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%

04:49:11.548 --> 04:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
people who wish to
 
04:49:20.430 --> 04:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:22.510 --> 04:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
Conley yes thank you for letting me
 
04:49:25.310 --> 04:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
testify um my name is Dr David Conway

currently president of the New Hampshire
 
04:49:32.230 --> 04:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine but I'm not testifying
 
04:49:34.270 --> 04:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
for the board I'm testifying testifying
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
for myself I don't have a lot to add to
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
all of the opinions you've had uh from
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
the various uh uh people opposing this I
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
did want to make some
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
statements uh concerning Mr Hennessy's
 
04:49:49.628 --> 04:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
test testimony he takes a very broad
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
brush in describing abortion and I don't
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
think this this bill should be about
 
04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
abortion um and in my training I was
 
04:50:06.430 --> 04:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
um present for the bir of uh induced
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
abortions at 18 weeks where babies came
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
out they gasped they had a heartbeat and
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
they were clearly not candidates for
 
04:50:17.110 --> 04:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
resuscitation they were candidates for
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
Humane care uh for a good part of my
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
career I practiced in rural uh
 
04:50:27.548 --> 04:50:27.558 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and attended uh several
 
04:50:31.390 --> 04:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
births of premature infants um one set
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
of twins at 24 weeks where where we were
 
04:50:35.708 --> 04:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
2 and a half hours from the nearest
 
04:50:39.548 --> 04:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
neonatal ICU and were able to deliver
 
04:50:41.948 --> 04:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
them and stabilize them and one of them
 
04:50:45.230 --> 04:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
survived but it is a real challenge when
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
you start taking care of babies um who
 
04:50:51.548 --> 04:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
are really approaching the limits of
 
04:50:53.150 --> 04:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
survivability I really don't have
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
anything more than that to say I I
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
sincerely oppose this bill and for all
 
04:50:59.788 --> 04:50:59.798 align:start position:0%

233 uh I don't want to talk about
 
04:54:15.470 --> 04:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
abortion care today I want to talk about
 
04:54:18.910 --> 04:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
the real consequences of this bill for
 
04:54:21.788 --> 04:54:21.798 align:start position:0%
families in my church and my community
 
04:54:25.350 --> 04:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not a physician I'm just a pastor uh
 
04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
but I have been a hospital chaplain
 
04:54:29.070 --> 04:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
including at a children's hospital
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
hospital and as a Hospice chaplain that
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
means unfortunately I've been with a
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
number of families while their loved
 
04:54:37.548 --> 04:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
ones died and this has unfortunately
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
included newborn
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
babies like people of all ages uh some
 
04:54:46.990 --> 04:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
babies are not going to survive their
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and viability is not an
 
04:54:53.390 --> 04:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
option I've uh been with a lot of loving
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
parents who have had to make hard
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
decisions about whether to resuscitate
 
04:55:01.510 --> 04:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
or whether to take Extraordinary
 
04:55:04.628 --> 04:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
Measures it's so hard to make these
 
04:55:06.430 --> 04:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
calls I've sat with these families as
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
their chaplain and as their
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
pastor and I've watched parents who know
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
that their children will not survive
 
04:55:15.990 --> 04:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
more than a few hours or days talk about
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
how they don't want to cause their child
 
04:55:20.708 --> 04:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
more pain instead they they want time to
 
04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
hold the child they want time to be with
 
04:55:26.910 --> 04:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
the child to uh impart the love of that
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
family with the
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
child they often want their clergy
 
04:55:33.390 --> 04:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
member um their Pastor or their pri
 
04:55:35.788 --> 04:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
Prest to baptize a child something that
 
04:55:37.230 --> 04:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are clergy who
 
04:55:40.150 --> 04:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
believe in infant baptism must be done
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
while the child is
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
alive um if the child is is undergoing
 
04:55:48.868 --> 04:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
medical care that is not going to save
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
their life but just Pro
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
prolong um prolong a life that will not
 
04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
be be saved ultimately then it's
 
04:55:59.910 --> 04:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
actually taking away their right to have
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
the child receive this religious
 
04:56:05.150 --> 04:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
sacrament by saying you you can't
 
04:56:07.948 --> 04:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
baptize this kid we have to go and do
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
this uh medical procedure on them it's
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
eating into precious time for the family
 
04:56:16.750 --> 04:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
and the family's community and it's
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
heartless to put parents in that
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
position it's heartless to not give them
 
04:56:23.788 --> 04:56:23.798 align:start position:0%
the time to let the child meet them
 
04:56:26.230 --> 04:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
their siblings their grandparents their
 
04:56:26.240 --> 04:56:27.310 align:start position:0%
their siblings their grandparents their
religious

04:56:27.310 --> 04:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
religious
 
04:56:29.788 --> 04:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
community and medical staff shouldn't
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
have to be concerned about the
 
04:56:34.030 --> 04:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
ramifications and even criminalization
 
04:56:37.270 --> 04:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
of making the best informed choice that
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
their training and ethics provides for
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
them this is just going to hurt grieving
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
families by taking away dignity and
 
04:56:46.990 --> 04:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
comfort and increasing the trauma that
 
04:56:49.470 --> 04:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
they will doubtlessly already have and
 
04:56:52.190 --> 04:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
so I ask you uh having been there for so
 
04:56:54.270 --> 04:56:54.280 align:start position:0%

newborn please don't politicize this
 
04:56:58.868 --> 04:56:58.878 align:start position:0%

she

04:57:48.788 --> 04:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:52.270 --> 04:57:52.280 align:start position:0%

04:58:03.548 --> 04:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
name is Beth scare I live in nashwa and
 
04:58:07.470 --> 04:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to point out that most
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
all the people opposing the bill um
 
04:58:14.110 --> 04:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
totally missed the point of the bill uh
 
04:58:16.990 --> 04:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
reading from it it says any born alive
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
in infant including one born in the
 
04:58:20.310 --> 04:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
course of abortion she'll be treated as
 
04:58:23.430 --> 04:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
a legal person and under the laws of the
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
state with the same rights to medically
 
04:58:28.150 --> 04:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate and reasonable care and
 
04:58:30.670 --> 04:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
treatment any health care provider
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
present at the time the infant is born
 
04:58:35.230 --> 04:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
shall take all all medically appropriate
 
04:58:37.390 --> 04:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
and reasonable actions to preserve the
 
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
life and health of the born alive infant
 
04:58:43.548 --> 04:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
so everyone who is opining about how
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
this would require
 
04:58:45.280 --> 04:58:47.430 align:start position:0%
this would require
extraordinary

04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
interventions or prevent the baby from
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
being baptized or put on a ventilator
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
when the baby's near death is just a
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
total misinterpretation of the law and
 
04:59:03.990 --> 04:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'm really shocked especially at jeie
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
rusa who uh should know better than uh
 
04:59:10.110 --> 04:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
to misinterpret the plain language of
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
this law and um also I wanted to point
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
out um there is no restriction on
 
04:59:20.350 --> 04:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
abortion you know it's it's it's legal
 
04:59:22.910 --> 04:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
through all nine months of pregnancy in
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and there's no there's no
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
accounting done so we have no idea how
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
late abortions are being performed
 
04:59:32.110 --> 04:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
although today we heard that they are
 
04:59:34.030 --> 04:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
performing third trimester abortions
 
04:59:35.190 --> 04:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
from one of the
 
04:59:37.590 --> 04:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
doctors and we don't know who's
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
surviving we don't know what condition
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're survive what condition
 
04:59:45.430 --> 04:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're being born in after abortions
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
and um Jason pointed out in other states
 
04:59:50.548 --> 04:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
they are keeping track of this and we
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
happening and um Melissa Odin is an
 
04:59:58.470 --> 04:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
abortion Survivor she wrote a book um
 
05:00:01.390 --> 05:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
you carried me where she recounts how
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
her own mother was
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh forced to undergo an abortion as a
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
teenager and um while her grandm her
 
05:00:12.750 --> 05:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
grandmother forced the abortion on her
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
own daughter and while her grandmother
 
05:00:17.708 --> 05:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
was out of the room and Melissa's mom
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
was unconscious Melissa was born alive
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
after the failed
 
05:00:26.110 --> 05:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
abortion and by the grace of God a nurse
 
05:00:28.270 --> 05:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
took pity on her and got her medical
 
05:00:30.990 --> 05:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
care and the question is if the family
 
05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
were given the choice of whether to
 
05:00:37.510 --> 05:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
provide medical care would that
 
05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
grandmother who forced that abortion
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
allowed Medical Care to be
 
05:00:46.350 --> 05:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
performed I'm guessing she wouldn't have
 
05:00:48.990 --> 05:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
so I mean these are the situations that
 
05:00:51.150 --> 05:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
babies are being born
 
05:00:55.310 --> 05:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
into and I I'm asking you to vote OTP on
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
HB 233 so that these born Alive babies
 
05:01:00.868 --> 05:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
can be
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
treated like any other human being in
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
the state and be provided appropriate
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%

newfields and I appreciate the
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today in
 
05:02:58.230 --> 05:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB
 
05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
233 I'm a single mother of two girls and
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
should anything happened to either of my
 
05:03:07.948 --> 05:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
daughters it would be on me to decide
 
05:03:10.948 --> 05:03:10.958 align:start position:0%
their end of life care I personally
 
05:03:14.310 --> 05:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
would not be able to see either of my
 
05:03:17.230 --> 05:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
children hooked up to life support um
 
05:03:19.390 --> 05:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
equipment and knowing that they had no
 
05:03:21.070 --> 05:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
future to live on their
 
05:03:24.670 --> 05:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
own such difficult decisions about our
 
05:03:27.030 --> 05:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
loved ones are
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
personal and I know this because my mom
 
05:03:34.750 --> 05:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
just died so as my children's medical
 
05:03:37.708 --> 05:03:37.718 align:start position:0%
proxy um it's a difficult
 
05:03:40.510 --> 05:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
decision but I shudder at the notion of
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
politicians telling me what would be
 
05:03:45.868 --> 05:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
best for my children most of us would
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
never think it appropriate to intrude on
 
05:03:52.190 --> 05:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
such private moments yet that's what HB
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
233 is doing the bill protects no one it
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
would only serve to create pain and
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
suffering by denying families the right
 
05:04:04.670 --> 05:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
to make their own
 
05:04:07.470 --> 05:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
compassionate very emotional decisions
 
05:04:10.030 --> 05:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
about their infant and consultation with
 
05:04:12.430 --> 05:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
their doctor and in accordance to their
 
05:04:15.868 --> 05:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
own faith for these reasons I
 
05:04:18.190 --> 05:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
respectfully urg members of this
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%

the opportunity to speak again uh you've
 
05:05:07.750 --> 05:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
heard some testimony uh in this
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
presentation thus far some of which I
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
was kind of shocked to hear uh one of
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
the Physicians actually is my wife's uh
 
05:05:20.948 --> 05:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
PCP which shocked me to know in because
 
05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
the expression that she had uh that that
 
05:05:27.510 --> 05:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
doctor had given um in
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
conversations was
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
more uh generalized than
 
05:05:34.670 --> 05:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
the presentation that was given to the
 
05:05:37.230 --> 05:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
committee was very very shocking I just
 
05:05:39.868 --> 05:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
wanted the committee to be aware of
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
that okay as was St as was stated in
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
this by others in this bill there is an
 
05:05:50.030 --> 05:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
escape clause and a lot of the testimony
 
05:05:54.510 --> 05:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
ignored that within the bill is language
 
05:05:56.948 --> 05:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
that says medically
 
05:05:59.190 --> 05:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate and a lot of the people
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
testifying seem to have glossed over
 
05:06:01.840 --> 05:06:02.948 align:start position:0%
testifying seem to have glossed over
that

05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
and talked about the worst case
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
scenarios which is something we as
 
05:06:09.548 --> 05:06:09.558 align:start position:0%
legislators need to be aware of but
 
05:06:14.110 --> 05:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
within this bill is the Clause that says
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate for the
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances then in there
 
05:06:21.548 --> 05:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
existing that is the important thing to
 
05:06:23.310 --> 05:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
remember about this
 
05:06:25.948 --> 05:06:25.958 align:start position:0%
bill and I thank the the chair for the
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak again and I thank
 
05:06:29.948 --> 05:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
the committee for listening to this
 
05:06:32.548 --> 05:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes emotional testimony on by the
 
05:06:34.750 --> 05:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
way I've delivered babies in the field
 
05:06:36.788 --> 05:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
I've delivered dead babies in the field
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
I've resuscitated babies in the field uh
 
05:06:44.110 --> 05:06:44.120 align:start position:0%

05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
question more in the nature of a point
 
05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
of order which was uh the representative
 
05:06:51.788 --> 05:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
just spoke
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
revealed the name of his wife's uh
 
05:06:57.788 --> 05:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
primary care position that seems like a
 
05:07:00.030 --> 05:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
breach of his wife's poverty privacy I
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't really know whether or not she
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
really I just said an individual I
 
05:07:06.070 --> 05:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
didn't say which which one of the
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
several doctors that spoke all
 
05:07:10.440 --> 05:07:11.948 align:start position:0%
several doctors that spoke all
right

05:07:11.948 --> 05:07:11.958 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
thanks I don't think he named the doctor
 
05:07:16.910 --> 05:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
he pointed out what he thought was an
 
05:07:20.230 --> 05:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
doctors representative Chase did you
 
05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:07:26.910 --> 05:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair um thanks for taking
 
05:07:30.110 --> 05:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
my question what exactly who decides
 
05:07:31.990 --> 05:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
what is medically appropriate and could
 
05:07:36.510 --> 05:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
you Define that for me please the
 
05:07:39.390 --> 05:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
medical the medical determines what's
 
05:07:41.590 --> 05:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate the bill doesn't
 
05:07:43.390 --> 05:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't say in every instance
 
05:07:45.628 --> 05:07:45.638 align:start position:0%
it says what's medically appropriate
 
05:07:47.590 --> 05:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's the same decision I had to make
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
several times is a paramedic whether the
 
05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
continue res resuscitation of an adult
 
05:07:56.670 --> 05:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
or a child or an infant or whether not
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
to continue res
 
05:08:01.270 --> 05:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
resuscitation in the field the doctor in
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital said or in a in a clinic
 
05:08:06.190 --> 05:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
setting who makes the decision whether
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
or not it's appropriate to continue or
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
to do extraordinary um Services that's
 
05:08:15.310 --> 05:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
the medical decision of the medical
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.230 --> 05:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%

the medical field we the people are in
 
05:09:18.910 --> 05:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
charge of the

Constitution there is um the 14th
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that protects the privacy of
 
05:09:27.230 --> 05:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
women but it is balanced with the
 
05:09:30.030 --> 05:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
viability of a baby and that's at nine
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%

05:09:53.830 --> 05:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
into me now I know they were rods
 
05:09:55.830 --> 05:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
dilating me but at the time I did not
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
know I was told to leave I left with
 
05:10:00.510 --> 05:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
somebody was taken to a
 
05:10:03.868 --> 05:10:03.878 align:start position:0%

05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
upstairs saw the vacuum with the blood
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
coming out the nurse stood in front of
 
05:10:48.990 --> 05:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
me so she could block that blood scene I
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
was seeing stared at the wall she took
 
05:10:55.708 --> 05:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
my hand and said it's going to be
 
05:11:01.350 --> 05:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay I was then taken back to my home by
 
05:11:04.030 --> 05:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
somebody only to walk down the road
 
05:11:06.110 --> 05:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
first so nobody would know what would
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
happen in gym class the next day in
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
school this is not medically appropriate
 
05:11:15.910 --> 05:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
care there was a throwing me on the pill
 
05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards no
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
counsel there was no healing and Miss
 
05:11:25.470 --> 05:11:25.480 align:start position:0%

05:11:31.990 --> 05:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill I definitely support for over
 
05:11:34.590 --> 05:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
oversight um for the medical community
 
05:11:36.430 --> 05:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
we are all held accountable to one
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
another um and we definitely have that
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
right to ask our rep representatives to
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
balance this out with the um with the
 
05:11:49.270 --> 05:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
baby the baby has a right to live and we
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
should be doing everything we can to
 
05:11:54.430 --> 05:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
save a baby I mean it's just human
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
nature and our society has always prided
 
05:11:59.948 --> 05:11:59.958 align:start position:0%
itself in caring for the poor the
 
05:12:03.230 --> 05:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
widowed the fatherless and this adds to
 
05:12:05.350 --> 05:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
a culture of death when we want a
 
05:12:07.470 --> 05:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
culture of life and that's my testimony

students in the New Hampshire area and I
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
am testifying to support House Bill
 
05:12:47.788 --> 05:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
233 the merits of this bill are
 
05:12:49.708 --> 05:12:49.718 align:start position:0%
straightforward to provide protection
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
Aid and medical treatment to infants who
 
05:12:53.310 --> 05:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
are born alive where I think this bill
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
is receiving significant backlash is
 
05:12:57.670 --> 05:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
that this bill recognizes that abortion
 
05:13:00.350 --> 05:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
procedures can fail the only way to have
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
a successful abortion procedure is if
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
the pre-born human in the womb is
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
terminated when they're not you have an
 
05:13:08.788 --> 05:13:08.798 align:start position:0%
infant who is in fact born alive there
 
05:13:10.750 --> 05:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
are countless stories Rosa Rodriguez a
 
05:13:13.310 --> 05:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
young woman in New York Melissa Odin
 
05:13:16.190 --> 05:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
Gianna jessen CLA cwell and a student I
 
05:13:17.910 --> 05:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
know personally who are abortion
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
survivors they were born in an abortion
 
05:13:21.788 --> 05:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
facility and due to the born alive
 
05:13:24.110 --> 05:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
infant protection laws in that state at
 
05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
those certain times or by the actions of
 
05:13:27.948 --> 05:13:27.958 align:start position:0%
someone else they were saved they were
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
rushed on had emergency medical
 
05:13:32.548 --> 05:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
treatment because they were recognized
 
05:13:34.548 --> 05:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
under the law as persons who were
 
05:13:37.510 --> 05:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
deserving of medical treatment so this
 
05:13:39.868 --> 05:13:39.878 align:start position:0%
bill recognizes that the fact that the
 
05:13:41.590 --> 05:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
primary role of a health care physician
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
is to do no harm and to save as much
 
05:13:44.788 --> 05:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
life as
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
possible many of the doctors and medical
 
05:13:49.230 --> 05:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
professionals commenting on this bill
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
today spoke of how this bill violates
 
05:13:52.990 --> 05:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
the way in which they can care for their
 
05:13:54.990 --> 05:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
patients I do not think that is the
 
05:13:56.910 --> 05:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
correct way to interpret the bill text
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
Lay forward by House Bill 233 I would
 
05:14:02.190 --> 05:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
also like to call attention to many
 
05:14:04.110 --> 05:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
families who have babies who are born
 
05:14:05.548 --> 05:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
with a life-threatening ailment can
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
choose perinatal hospice and I'd like to
 
05:14:09.510 --> 05:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
lay forward the definition of what
 
05:14:12.390 --> 05:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
perinal hospice is paranal hospice and
 
05:14:13.948 --> 05:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
Pala of care is an Innovative and
 
05:14:15.470 --> 05:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
compassionate model of support for
 
05:14:16.910 --> 05:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
parents who choose to continue their
 
05:14:18.750 --> 05:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancies following a prenatal
 
05:14:20.590 --> 05:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis indicating that their baby has
 
05:14:22.708 --> 05:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
a life limiting condition and might die
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
before or shortly after B birth as
 
05:14:27.070 --> 05:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
prenatal testing continues to advance
 
05:14:28.548 --> 05:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
more families are finding themselves in
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
this heartbreaking situation perinatal
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
Hospice in incorporates the philosophy
 
05:14:34.390 --> 05:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
and expertise of hospice and paliative
 
05:14:36.030 --> 05:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
Care into the care of this new
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
population of patients this specialized
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
support is provided from the time of
 
05:14:41.430 --> 05:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosis through the baby's birth and
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
death perinal Pala of care helps parents
 
05:14:45.628 --> 05:14:45.638 align:start position:0%
Embrace whatever life their baby might
 
05:14:48.590 --> 05:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
be able to have before and after birth
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion I support the passage
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 233 and I encourage you
 
05:14:55.390 --> 05:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
all to support it as well thank you so
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%

05:15:00.190 --> 05:15:00.200 align:start position:0%

05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
at this
 
05:15:17.670 --> 05:15:17.680 align:start position:0%

05:15:30.558 --> 05:15:32.350 align:start position:0%
 
Cen

05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
Cen
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me yes we can hear you
 
05:15:37.390 --> 05:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon members of the
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee um again I was not uh planning
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
on I testified earlier this morning um
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition to several bills I again
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
was not planning on testifying today in
 
05:15:50.390 --> 05:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to um House Bill 233 but
 
05:15:52.990 --> 05:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
after listening to the hearings I feel I
 
05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
must speak um I'll be brief because I
 
05:15:57.070 --> 05:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
understand this hearing has been
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
incredibly emotional but I just want to
 
05:16:00.910 --> 05:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
be clear this bill may not be directly
 
05:16:03.390 --> 05:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
related to abortion it should be noted
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
that 66% of granite Staters support
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
abortion in all cases which is Five
 
05:16:11.110 --> 05:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
Points higher than the national average
 
05:16:13.390 --> 05:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
and beyond that I would hedge a bet that
 
05:16:16.030 --> 05:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
the reason why abortion is uh has
 
05:16:18.190 --> 05:16:18.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support here in the granite
 
05:16:20.190 --> 05:16:20.200 align:start position:0%
state um is because Granite Staters
 
05:16:22.510 --> 05:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
agree the government does not deserve a
 
05:16:25.070 --> 05:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
place um between you and your uh
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
physician and your medical provider
 
05:16:29.750 --> 05:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is no reason to legislate
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
something that is a non-issue there is
 
05:16:34.030 --> 05:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
no infanticide happening it was raised
 
05:16:36.270 --> 05:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
earlier that there was a CDC report um
 
05:16:37.868 --> 05:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
highlighting instances of this I would
 
05:16:39.310 --> 05:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
just like to note that that report has
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
been discredited by multiple um OBGYN
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
providers um so I just do not think that
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
should be considered when you uh take
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
your final vote on this um I urge you to
 
05:16:54.310 --> 05:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
um rule that this bill is um inexpedient
 
05:16:56.830 --> 05:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
to legislate um this is an incredibly
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
painful uh situation that parents have
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
to go through um when there are medical
 
05:17:07.510 --> 05:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
problems with their child um and frankly
 
05:17:09.750 --> 05:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
it is inappropriate for legislators to
 
05:17:11.990 --> 05:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
have a role in that decision-making
 
05:17:15.070 --> 05:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
process um and I think that uh all of
 
05:17:16.990 --> 05:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
your constituents would agree on that so
 
05:17:19.750 --> 05:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
I urge you to itl this bill it is just
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate um and not right for New
 
05:17:24.510 --> 05:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for your time um I'm
 
05:17:26.910 --> 05:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank you Miss
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:33.628 --> 05:17:33.638 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:17:38.150 --> 05:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and I see no other hands up
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
that being the case I am going to end
 
05:17:45.310 --> 05:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill
 
05:17:47.830 --> 05:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
233 and note that I didn't do a very
 
05:17:50.510 --> 05:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
good job of uh judging the time it would
 
05:17:53.070 --> 05:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
take on that bill today so we have
 
05:17:54.750 --> 05:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
another hearing which is scheduled for 3
 
05:17:54.760 --> 05:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
another hearing which is scheduled for 3
o'clock

05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:02.590 --> 05:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
today and we will and the the other
 
05:18:04.990 --> 05:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
thing I will note is that
 
05:18:07.590 --> 05:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative MCB best points well
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
taken and I should have been more
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
assertive I think in uh stepping in and
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
addressing the fact that there were uh
 
05:18:16.270 --> 05:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
personal references made and we'll try
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
to do a better job of that in the future
 
05:18:23.350 --> 05:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
and with that uh I think we'll be in
 
05:18:25.548 --> 05:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
recess until 3
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:30.320 --> 05:18:48.190 align:start position:0%

that is a bill creating a private cause
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
of action for discrimination based on
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%

to speak to the committee with regard to

name is representative Mary Beth walls I
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh represent the towns of bow and
 
06:00:27.270 --> 06:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton and Marram District 23 uh Mr
 
06:00:28.628 --> 06:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
chair chairman I'd also like to point
 
06:00:29.708 --> 06:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
out that there were supposed to be a
 
06:00:32.150 --> 06:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
couple of co-sponsors on this and there
 
06:00:33.350 --> 06:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
were a couple of problems with
 
06:00:35.190 --> 06:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
legislative services and one is being
 
06:00:36.750 --> 06:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
reflected in the amendment and the other
 
06:00:38.990 --> 06:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
one is the lack of co-sponsors um and
 
06:00:40.868 --> 06:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors are submitting testimony
 
06:00:42.628 --> 06:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
to you but the bill really did have more
 
06:00:44.670 --> 06:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
support than just me it's just that
 
06:00:46.670 --> 06:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
legislative servic has had an oversight
 
06:00:48.510 --> 06:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
which I will also address the rest of in
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
a moment um so let me just start uh this
 
06:00:54.190 --> 06:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to protect people in
 
06:00:56.310 --> 06:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
schools and in the workplace from
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination based natural hairstyles
 
06:01:01.150 --> 06:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
you have before you an amendment because
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
of a misunderstanding in the drafting of

this bill the bill is drafted exempts
 
06:01:07.830 --> 06:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers from the
 
06:01:10.270 --> 06:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
requirement of the bill I really have no
 
06:01:11.830 --> 06:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
interest in how Corrections Officers
 
06:01:14.310 --> 06:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
wear their hair what I intended to do
 
06:01:16.830 --> 06:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
was exempt prisoners because having done
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
my research on this it came apparent to
 
06:01:20.670 --> 06:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
me that the Department of Corrections
 
06:01:22.910 --> 06:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
had a problem with this bill protecting
 
06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
prisoners so the amendment before you
 
06:01:28.150 --> 06:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
fixes it the amendment is co-sponsored
 
06:01:30.230 --> 06:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
by representative Smith who did this as
 
06:01:32.670 --> 06:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
a courtesy to me because it's my
 
06:01:34.030 --> 06:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that Amendments have to be
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
sponsored by a member of the committee I
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
called her and she graciously agreed
 
06:01:40.468 --> 06:01:40.478 align:start position:0%
that she would be on my Amendment so
 
06:01:41.948 --> 06:01:41.958 align:start position:0%
there's no question as to the
 
06:01:43.628 --> 06:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
committee's ability to accept the
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment does not replace
 
06:01:48.230 --> 06:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
the bill it fixes the oversight in the
 
06:01:50.230 --> 06:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
bill with respect to the difference
 
06:01:52.590 --> 06:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
between prisoners and Corrections
 
06:01:55.190 --> 06:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
Officers the bill originated with a
 
06:01:58.350 --> 06:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
coalition known as the crown coalition
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
Crown is an acronym which I always have
 
06:02:03.830 --> 06:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
to look up and it's called creating a
 
06:02:06.590 --> 06:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
respectful and open world for natural
 
06:02:09.468 --> 06:02:09.478 align:start position:0%
hairstyles it's actually funded by Dove
 
06:02:10.948 --> 06:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
soap and if you go on to the website
 
06:02:12.990 --> 06:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see Dove soap all over it but it
 
06:02:15.190 --> 06:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
includes more than 70 organizations
 
06:02:16.830 --> 06:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
across the country advocating for
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislation like this this legislation
 
06:02:22.030 --> 06:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
or legislation similar to it has been
 
06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
already been enacted to law in seven
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
states California New York New Jersey
 
06:02:30.788 --> 06:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
Virginia Colorado Washington and
 
06:02:32.990 --> 06:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
Maryland and it's also been enacted in
 
06:02:35.468 --> 06:02:35.478 align:start position:0%
several cities and currently in this
 
06:02:37.708 --> 06:02:37.718 align:start position:0%
current session it's introduced in over
 
06:02:41.150 --> 06:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
20 States as well and while the crown
 
06:02:42.910 --> 06:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
Coalition focuses their work on the
 
06:02:45.350 --> 06:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
workplace this bill is broader and it
 
06:02:47.430 --> 06:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
also includes
 
06:02:49.750 --> 06:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
schools there is a long history of
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on natural
 
06:02:54.830 --> 06:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
hairstyles our perceptions of attractive
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
hairstyles are rooted in white Skinner
 
06:02:58.990 --> 06:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
of appearance that perpetuate
 
06:03:02.270 --> 06:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
stereotypes that natural hairstyles are
 
06:03:04.628 --> 06:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
unprofessional this is an unconscious
 
06:03:07.110 --> 06:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
bias by people who are not
 
06:03:10.150 --> 06:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
black natural hairstyles are three times
 
06:03:12.468 --> 06:03:12.478 align:start position:0%
more likely to be perceived as
 
06:03:14.310 --> 06:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
unprofessional people with natural
 
06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
hairstyles are rated less ready for a
 
06:03:20.310 --> 06:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
job when asked 80% of black women report
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
having to change from a natural
 
06:03:25.030 --> 06:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
hairstyle to fit into their office this
 
06:03:27.468 --> 06:03:27.478 align:start position:0%
is no small thing changing for from
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
natural hair often involves regular
 
06:03:32.590 --> 06:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
loose of expense use of expense of harsh
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals and excessive heat while the
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
men in the room may not be able to
 
06:03:39.150 --> 06:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
relate to this I expect several women
 
06:03:40.510 --> 06:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
will understand that this is like
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
coloring your hair but much
 
06:03:46.510 --> 06:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
harsher uh this is not just a workplace
 
06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
issue in schools there are plenty of
 
06:03:51.830 --> 06:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
documented cases of children being given
 
06:03:54.670 --> 06:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
detention suspended or expelled for
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
wearing natural hair there are cases of
 
06:03:58.868 --> 06:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
children being refused admittance to
 
06:04:01.270 --> 06:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
private schools there are documented
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
cases of athletes being told to cut
 
06:04:04.868 --> 06:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
their hair or they're off the
 
06:04:08.948 --> 06:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
team these are outdated views but they
 
06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
persist even the military now allows
 
06:04:13.708 --> 06:04:13.718 align:start position:0%
women to wear dreadlocks or locks as
 
06:04:16.670 --> 06:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
they're now called and did anyone notice
 
06:04:18.548 --> 06:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
the hairstyles on the field in the Super
 
06:04:20.270 --> 06:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
Bowl on
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
Sunday there were certainly plenty of
 
06:04:24.190 --> 06:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
natural hairstyles
 
06:04:27.390 --> 06:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
there today you will hear stories both
 
06:04:29.070 --> 06:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
from students and from fellow
 
06:04:30.910 --> 06:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives about their
 
06:04:34.390 --> 06:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
experiences often this type of bias goes
 
06:04:36.750 --> 06:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
unrecognized yet discrimination based on
 
06:04:39.750 --> 06:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
natural hairstyles has legal economic
 
06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
and psychological costs a 2019 study
 
06:04:45.510 --> 06:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
found that there is immeasurable impact
 
06:04:48.468 --> 06:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
on black women black women are one and a
 
06:04:50.110 --> 06:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
half times more likely to be sent home
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
from the workplace due to their hair
 
06:04:54.628 --> 06:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
black women are 30% more likely to be
 
06:04:56.590 --> 06:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
called in and told about office policies
 
06:04:58.590 --> 06:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to hair and
 
06:05:01.868 --> 06:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
hygiene hair discrimination is race
 
06:05:05.150 --> 06:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination race is a protected class
 
06:05:06.910 --> 06:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
but the one case to address this issue
 
06:05:08.590 --> 06:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
or in the one case to address this issue
 
06:05:10.590 --> 06:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
the 11th circuit refused to support the
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
findings of the EEOC that discrimination
 
06:05:16.350 --> 06:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
due to natural hair is prohibited hence
 
06:05:18.270 --> 06:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
legislation like this is necessary to
 
06:05:20.708 --> 06:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
ensure Protections in a place like New
 
06:05:22.750 --> 06:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you are familiar with the
 
06:05:24.590 --> 06:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
Discrimination laws in h New Hampshire
 
06:05:25.788 --> 06:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
you may have noticed that this bill
 
06:05:27.548 --> 06:05:27.558 align:start position:0%
creates a private right of action rather
 
06:05:29.110 --> 06:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
than send victims to the New Hampshire
 
06:05:31.750 --> 06:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Commission victims would
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
still have the option of going through
 
06:05:35.310 --> 06:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
the commission but I believe that a
 
06:05:38.190 --> 06:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
faster remedy is necessary a student
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
told to cut his hair before he can join
 
06:05:42.070 --> 06:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
a sports team cannot wait the one to six
 
06:05:43.548 --> 06:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
months it takes for the commission to
 
06:05:45.990 --> 06:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
act they need an opportunity for
 
06:05:48.788 --> 06:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
immediate relief the sports season could
 
06:05:50.270 --> 06:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
well have ended before the commission
 
06:05:53.070 --> 06:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
could ask the same is true of job
 
06:05:55.430 --> 06:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
applicants and other for unforeseen
 
06:05:58.350 --> 06:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
victims this is why I am proposing a
 
06:06:00.390 --> 06:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
Second Avenue of relief for victims of
 
06:06:00.400 --> 06:06:01.990 align:start position:0%
Second Avenue of relief for victims of
this

06:06:01.990 --> 06:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:06:04.070 --> 06:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination some of you may think
 
06:06:05.670 --> 06:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
that because the most egregious cases
 
06:06:07.788 --> 06:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
documented in the Press are not based
 
06:06:09.708 --> 06:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that there's not a
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
problem here in New Hampshire that would
 
06:06:12.000 --> 06:06:12.830 align:start position:0%
problem here in New Hampshire that would
be

06:06:12.830 --> 06:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:06:15.708 --> 06:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
naive discrimination happens everywhere
 
06:06:18.030 --> 06:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
and we need to make it clear that it's
 
06:06:20.350 --> 06:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
not acceptable here in New
 
06:06:22.830 --> 06:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I ask that you recognize that
 
06:06:24.350 --> 06:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on natural
 
06:06:26.510 --> 06:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
hairstyles has far-reaching consequences
 
06:06:27.788 --> 06:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
in law
 
06:06:30.788 --> 06:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
in the workplace in schools and is
 
06:06:33.110 --> 06:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
followed by economic and psychological
 
06:06:35.150 --> 06:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
consequences and I ask that you vote
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to pass and send it to
 
06:06:39.548 --> 06:06:39.558 align:start position:0%
the Full House for passage and Mr
 
06:06:41.310 --> 06:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a question for you I
 
06:06:43.070 --> 06:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
sent you an email earlier today with a
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
list of witnesses that had failed to
 
06:06:48.468 --> 06:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
make the timeliness to sign up to speak
 
06:06:49.948 --> 06:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you've seen that
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
email or not but if not I have the list
 
06:06:55.590 --> 06:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
of witnesses I have it in front of me um
 
06:06:57.468 --> 06:06:57.478 align:start position:0%
I just got a call as this hearing was
 
06:07:00.350 --> 06:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
about to open from AO outh who said
 
06:07:02.430 --> 06:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
she's stuck in traffic in Washington DC
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
in a car and asks that you call her
 
06:07:07.750 --> 06:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
fifth on this list she said that her GPS
 
06:07:10.510 --> 06:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
said she'd be home by 3:15 so I just
 
06:07:11.948 --> 06:07:11.958 align:start position:0%
bring that to your attention otherwise
 
06:07:13.350 --> 06:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking to her in a
 
06:07:13.360 --> 06:07:14.868 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking to her in a
car

06:07:14.868 --> 06:07:14.878 align:start position:0%

06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
schools um yet some of your um testimony
 
06:07:44.230 --> 06:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
is talking about how this would apply to
 
06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
private schools as well um I'm wondering
 
06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
if you can clear that up um with me
 
06:07:50.670 --> 06:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
because I'm curious about that and then
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
also if I can have another one from the
 
06:07:56.468 --> 06:07:56.478 align:start position:0%
chair um do you have I I understand we
 
06:07:59.788 --> 06:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
would buy be naive and not finding a
 
06:08:01.468 --> 06:08:01.478 align:start position:0%
specific example in New Hampshire but do
 
06:08:03.948 --> 06:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
you have specific examples from New
 
06:08:06.708 --> 06:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where this has been a problem
 
06:08:09.868 --> 06:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
um and why doesn't this qualify under
 
06:08:12.628 --> 06:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
like the existing protected class of
 
06:08:15.230 --> 06:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
race thank you for the question um I'm
 
06:08:16.948 --> 06:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
going to take these in reverse order I
 
06:08:18.590 --> 06:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
would argue it does qualify under the
 
06:08:20.468 --> 06:08:20.478 align:start position:0%
protected class of race the 11th circuit
 
06:08:22.868 --> 06:08:22.878 align:start position:0%
found differently the EEOC did find it a
 
06:08:24.708 --> 06:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
protected class the 11th circuit refused
 
06:08:27.270 --> 06:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
to uphold that and when the 11 circuit
 
06:08:29.230 --> 06:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
refused to uphold it as when the crown
 
06:08:31.270 --> 06:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
Coalition was created and people started
 
06:08:32.948 --> 06:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
introducing these bills nationally in
 
06:08:35.948 --> 06:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
both states and cities um in terms of
 
06:08:37.670 --> 06:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
specific examples in New Hampshire I
 
06:08:39.628 --> 06:08:39.638 align:start position:0%
don't have one that's hit the Press but
 
06:08:40.990 --> 06:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear testimony from
 
06:08:42.830 --> 06:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
students here in New Hampshire as well
 
06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
as from fellow state representatives
 
06:08:47.190 --> 06:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
about their experiences here I think
 
06:08:48.750 --> 06:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
that at least all of them are at least
 
06:08:49.910 --> 06:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
some of them are right here in New
 
06:08:51.708 --> 06:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we don't have things that
 
06:08:53.350 --> 06:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
hit the newspaper like some of the high
 
06:08:55.468 --> 06:08:55.478 align:start position:0%
PR profile cases that you'll find when
 
06:08:57.270 --> 06:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
you go on the internet but it most
 
06:08:59.948 --> 06:08:59.958 align:start position:0%
certainly is happening here um and your
 
06:09:03.270 --> 06:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
first question was citing I'm sorry your
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
first question was I was talking
 
06:09:07.390 --> 06:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
specifically about the the RSA that
 
06:09:08.830 --> 06:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is public schools
 
06:09:10.590 --> 06:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
and you cited a bunch of uh like an
 
06:09:11.910 --> 06:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
example of private schools does this
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
apply to private schools as well it's my
 
06:09:16.110 --> 06:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
understanding it does not I'm not sure
 
06:09:17.590 --> 06:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
that we have the authority to regulate
 
06:09:18.788 --> 06:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing at private school
 
06:09:20.430 --> 06:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
unless they get Federal money if they
 
06:09:22.708 --> 06:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
get Federal money absolutely it does but
 
06:09:24.150 --> 06:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
if they don't get Federal money and I
 
06:09:26.468 --> 06:09:26.478 align:start position:0%
think most private schools don't then I
 
06:09:27.910 --> 06:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't don't think we have the authority
 
06:09:30.270 --> 06:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
to do it but I I would not want to stake
 
06:09:32.548 --> 06:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
my life on that perhaps one of the other
 
06:09:34.230 --> 06:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers on the committee has a better
 
06:09:37.030 --> 06:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
sense of that than I do thank
 
06:09:39.390 --> 06:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative syvia do
 
06:09:40.510 --> 06:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
06:09:44.910 --> 06:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
06:09:48.708 --> 06:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to figure out in this
 
06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
section 193 col 38 where you're trying
 
06:09:55.468 --> 06:09:55.478 align:start position:0%
to define
 
06:09:57.670 --> 06:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
race um
 
06:10:00.750 --> 06:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
and you're using a rather circular logic
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
in my
 
06:10:06.190 --> 06:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
opinion um race means immutable traits
 
06:10:10.110 --> 06:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
associated with race
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh I I have a hard time following that
 
06:10:17.548 --> 06:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
logic can you help me
 
06:10:20.468 --> 06:10:20.478 align:start position:0%
um I think let me just pull this up real
 
06:10:22.230 --> 06:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
quick I don't have the the bill in front
 
06:10:25.628 --> 06:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
of me um give me one
 
06:10:25.638 --> 06:10:29.350 align:start position:0%
of me um give me one
second

06:10:29.350 --> 06:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:35.190 --> 06:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:39.390 --> 06:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
um I think it's probably uh simply not
 
06:10:41.070 --> 06:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
the best drafting you know I sent it
 
06:10:43.628 --> 06:10:43.638 align:start position:0%
into legislative services and I agree
 
06:10:46.030 --> 06:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's not great drafting to say race
 
06:10:50.670 --> 06:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:53.230 --> 06:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
um that's the best I can tell you uh you
 
06:10:55.590 --> 06:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
know it's just not perfect drafting I
 
06:10:57.350 --> 06:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
think if you've a court trying to
 
06:10:58.910 --> 06:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
interpret it they would understand what
 
06:11:01.390 --> 06:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
you're trying to say um I think race has
 
06:11:03.548 --> 06:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
a a plain meaning in and of itself and
 
06:11:05.070 --> 06:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
that's how it's used the second time in
 
06:11:07.868 --> 06:11:07.878 align:start position:0%
that sentence um but I think you could
 
06:11:10.390 --> 06:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
have taken out uh rate the second race
 
06:11:12.230 --> 06:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
there and simply said race means traits
 
06:11:14.070 --> 06:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
including and go on and Define it from
 
06:11:19.030 --> 06:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
there if I can follow up yes you may so
 
06:11:23.110 --> 06:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
as we continue in that line uh it it
 
06:11:25.708 --> 06:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
uses including hair texture and
 
06:11:29.510 --> 06:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
protective hair Styles and then it goes
 
06:11:33.190 --> 06:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
to apparently defining protective
 
06:11:33.200 --> 06:11:34.990 align:start position:0%
to apparently defining protective
hairstyles

06:11:34.990 --> 06:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
hairstyles
 
06:11:35.000 --> 06:11:36.628 align:start position:0%
hairstyles
also

06:11:36.628 --> 06:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:11:40.110 --> 06:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
um yes drafting is a little bit of a
 
06:11:42.310 --> 06:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
problem I would say but is this to say
 
06:11:48.030 --> 06:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
that um race has only to do with hair
 
06:11:51.510 --> 06:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
texture and hair
 
06:11:54.150 --> 06:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
styles no it's not meant to be limiting
 
06:11:55.468 --> 06:11:55.478 align:start position:0%
it's meant to be
 
06:11:55.478 --> 06:11:57.750 align:start position:0%
it's meant to be
expanding

06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
06:11:57.760 --> 06:11:59.788 align:start position:0%
expanding
thank

thank
 
06:12:03.310 --> 06:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
 
06:12:03.320 --> 06:12:06.390 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
the

06:12:06.390 --> 06:12:06.400 align:start position:0%

honorable committee members thank you
 
06:12:43.590 --> 06:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
for my testimony I am representative

Charlotte D Lorenzo from New Market
 
06:12:50.150 --> 06:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
representing myself in support of HB
 
06:12:52.708 --> 06:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
359 by now you've probably learned that
 
06:12:54.510 --> 06:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
the texture of our hair is mainly
 
06:12:56.910 --> 06:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
determined by our DNA
 
06:12:56.920 --> 06:12:57.830 align:start position:0%
determined by our DNA
for

06:12:57.830 --> 06:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:12:59.868 --> 06:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
African-Americans our hair has a
 
06:13:03.350 --> 06:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
distinct curl pattern our hair texture
 
06:13:05.510 --> 06:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
differs from the straigh or hair of
 
06:13:08.830 --> 06:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
people of Caucasian and Asian descent
 
06:13:11.830 --> 06:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
for instance people use many words to
 
06:13:14.868 --> 06:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
describe ethnic hair texture for
 
06:13:16.750 --> 06:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
African-Americans our hair has been
 
06:13:19.830 --> 06:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
described as good hair bad hair kinky
 
06:13:23.468 --> 06:13:23.478 align:start position:0%

06:13:27.510 --> 06:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
coarse hair or worse hair styling Trends
 
06:13:30.910 --> 06:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
evolv periodically from about the late
 
06:13:33.788 --> 06:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
1800s African-American styling Trends

required chemical straightening or heat
 
06:13:39.110 --> 06:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
applications such as curling irons and
 
06:13:41.830 --> 06:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
hot Combs those treatments are very
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
painful and damaging to the hair
 
06:13:46.468 --> 06:13:46.478 align:start position:0%
structure medical studies suggest that
 
06:13:49.390 --> 06:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
chemical relaxers can cause
 
06:13:53.590 --> 06:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
cancer in the 1960s and 1970s people
 
06:13:57.070 --> 06:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
favored the natural look along Nam the
 
06:14:00.910 --> 06:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
afro the bigger the afro the better the
 
06:14:03.548 --> 06:14:03.558 align:start position:0%
look The Look went mainstream and people
 
06:14:06.990 --> 06:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
of every ethnic background splited curly
 
06:14:10.750 --> 06:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
perms during the 2000s African-Americans
 
06:14:13.310 --> 06:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
began wearing natural hair styles that
 
06:14:16.670 --> 06:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
Express their individuality and cultural
 
06:14:19.670 --> 06:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
identity today's popular Styles involve
 
06:14:22.468 --> 06:14:22.478 align:start position:0%
intricate braid patterns like dreadlocks
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
cornrows twist locks waves and curls
 
06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
these styles are durable and longlasting
 
06:14:33.230 --> 06:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
in 2019 a referee forced a high school
 
06:14:35.670 --> 06:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
wrestler to cut off his dreadlocks
 
06:14:38.708 --> 06:14:38.718 align:start position:0%
before he could compete in a match
 
06:14:40.948 --> 06:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
following an investigation the New
 
06:14:43.070 --> 06:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
Jersey attorney general suspended the
 
06:14:46.750 --> 06:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
referee for two years and as a remedy
 
06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
the school was required to undergo
 
06:14:50.468 --> 06:14:50.478 align:start position:0%
implicit bias
 
06:14:54.390 --> 06:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
training I support HB 359 a bill that
 
06:14:56.708 --> 06:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
will help prevent such incidents in New
 
06:14:58.788 --> 06:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this bill imposes
 
06:15:00.110 --> 06:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
penalties for
 
06:15:02.510 --> 06:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
violations every person deserves to live

Education well I'm not sure because I'm
 
06:16:14.230 --> 06:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer but I think it could be
 
06:16:18.670 --> 06:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
um a personal cause of action by the
 
06:16:20.670 --> 06:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
person who feels they were discriminated
 
06:16:24.230 --> 06:16:24.240 align:start position:0%

thank you very much for taking my
 
06:16:44.430 --> 06:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to follow up a
 
06:16:47.510 --> 06:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
little bit on Representatives Sylvia's
 
06:16:50.150 --> 06:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
observation about the expanse of nature
 
06:16:52.430 --> 06:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
of the definition and so I'm just trying
 
06:16:56.670 --> 06:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
to understand let's say someone who was
 
06:17:00.110 --> 06:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
of Caucasian or Asian origin if they
 
06:17:04.150 --> 06:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
were to adopt a hairstyle that was
 
06:17:06.750 --> 06:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
African-American in origin does does
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
this cover them or is it just to cover
 
06:17:12.548 --> 06:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
natural hairstyles for that race what's
 
06:17:17.110 --> 06:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
the intent of it I guess well your first
 
06:17:20.110 --> 06:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
question does it cover for instance
 
06:17:21.948 --> 06:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
someone of a different
 
06:17:26.628 --> 06:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
ethnic um Heritage than African
 
06:17:29.070 --> 06:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
American yes I think it
 
06:17:31.310 --> 06:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
would and what was your second question
 
06:17:34.150 --> 06:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative so so so does
 
06:17:37.030 --> 06:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
it cover a person that chooses to use a
 
06:17:39.468 --> 06:17:39.478 align:start position:0%
hairstyle that is not of their ethnic
 
06:17:42.468 --> 06:17:42.478 align:start position:0%
origin so um if if you were a white
 
06:17:45.510 --> 06:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
person that really liked a hairstyle of
 
06:17:48.190 --> 06:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
African-American origin does this
 
06:17:51.830 --> 06:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
protect your ability to express that um
 
06:17:53.948 --> 06:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
even though you're not of the same
 
06:17:56.230 --> 06:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
ethnic background as that hairstyle
 
06:17:56.240 --> 06:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
ethnic background as that hairstyle
associated

06:17:57.510 --> 06:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
associated
 
06:18:01.548 --> 06:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
with I really I'm really not sure maybe
 
06:18:03.670 --> 06:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
um representative Waltz would be able to
 
06:18:05.670 --> 06:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
answer that question or one of the
 
06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers in the room thank
 
06:18:12.868 --> 06:18:12.878 align:start position:0%

cut you
 
06:18:21.390 --> 06:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
off uh no I uh I maybe my hand didn't go
 
06:18:23.070 --> 06:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
down I'm not sure if I take care of that
 
06:18:25.430 --> 06:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
or you do okay just just checking
 
06:18:28.270 --> 06:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
representa sober yes thank you Mr chair
 
06:18:30.030 --> 06:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
06:18:33.390 --> 06:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
would this bill as written cover uh the
 
06:18:36.390 --> 06:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
hairstyles of hiic Jews who typically
 
06:18:40.788 --> 06:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
have very long uh sideburns call pus and
 
06:18:45.270 --> 06:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:47.990 --> 06:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
would I mean part of the intent intent
 
06:18:52.390 --> 06:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to protect people um
 
06:18:56.350 --> 06:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
whose ethnicity um or
 
06:18:59.708 --> 06:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
I would even believe religion
 
06:19:04.788 --> 06:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
um favors a certain type of
 
06:19:08.150 --> 06:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
hairstyle a followup Mr
 
06:19:10.788 --> 06:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
chair but in reading the language here
 
06:19:13.150 --> 06:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
and the additional language on lines 9
 
06:19:16.150 --> 06:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
through 11 it seems to focus almost
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
exclusively on African-Americans and it
 
06:19:22.990 --> 06:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
mentions braids locks tight curls Cur uh
 
06:19:26.510 --> 06:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
coils or curls cornrows Etc uh nothing
 
06:19:30.430 --> 06:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
about beards or U you know any kind of
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
hairstyle protected by or dictated by
 
06:19:33.360 --> 06:19:35.230 align:start position:0%
hairstyle protected by or dictated by
religious

06:19:35.230 --> 06:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
religious
 
06:19:38.430 --> 06:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
affiliation I'll to tell you honestly um
 
06:19:40.670 --> 06:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative silur I think that a
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:47.190 --> 06:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you you're
 
06:19:49.350 --> 06:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
06:19:52.150 --> 06:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair and um
 
06:19:53.310 --> 06:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
question um I'm concerned that the
 
06:19:57.310 --> 06:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
language says it it says certain types
 
06:19:59.708 --> 06:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
of hair it says including but it doesn't
 
06:20:01.830 --> 06:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
have it's it doesn't add the not
 
06:20:04.708 --> 06:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
limiting to so could you find that maybe
 
06:20:06.910 --> 06:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
like somebody that does not have a
 
06:20:11.030 --> 06:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
hairstyle um like or is bald um an
 
06:20:13.390 --> 06:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
African-American would have grounds to
 
06:20:15.468 --> 06:20:15.478 align:start position:0%
um have a cause of action because it
 
06:20:17.830 --> 06:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't limit the exact
 
06:20:17.840 --> 06:20:20.030 align:start position:0%
doesn't limit the exact
hairstyles

06:20:20.030 --> 06:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
hairstyles
 
06:20:22.990 --> 06:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect representative
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander I don't think that your
 
06:20:27.788 --> 06:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
question question is dramatic to the
 
06:20:31.430 --> 06:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
issue at hand or gerain to the issue at
 
06:20:31.440 --> 06:20:36.868 align:start position:0%
issue at hand or gerain to the issue at
hand

06:20:36.868 --> 06:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:42.030 --> 06:20:42.040 align:start position:0%

06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
in the list from that was previously
 
06:21:01.708 --> 06:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned by representative Waltz so I I
 
06:21:04.230 --> 06:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
need to just limit the testimony to no
 
06:21:06.590 --> 06:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
more than three minutes to everyone in
 
06:21:08.990 --> 06:21:09.000 align:start position:0%

have conclude today by four o'clock as
 
06:21:13.990 --> 06:21:14.000 align:start position:0%

06:21:15.948 --> 06:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
done on the internet here at the
 
06:21:22.990 --> 06:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
lob so um I'm going to call next on uh
 
06:21:32.830 --> 06:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:38.548 --> 06:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
available you could raise your hand if
 
06:21:45.350 --> 06:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
there I don't
 
06:21:47.520 --> 06:21:49.070 align:start position:0%
there I don't
see

06:21:49.070 --> 06:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:21:52.830 --> 06:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
that person at least under that
 
06:22:07.750 --> 06:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:12.230 --> 06:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
there's hi um my name is Lydia Yen and I
 
06:22:14.310 --> 06:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
am the lead organizer for change for
 
06:22:17.230 --> 06:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
conquered in conquered New Hampshire I
 
06:22:19.830 --> 06:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
am testifying today on behalf of myself
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
change for conquered and all students
 
06:22:24.270 --> 06:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
and people of color who wear protective
 
06:22:27.030 --> 06:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
styles including head wraps and have
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
curly hair change for conquered is a
 
06:22:31.910 --> 06:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
group that works to eliminate racism in
 
06:22:34.030 --> 06:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
our community and make it more welcoming
 
06:22:36.830 --> 06:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
for young adults so naturally this is
 
06:22:38.670 --> 06:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
something that we care about
 
06:22:41.350 --> 06:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
deeply since this bill concerns students
 
06:22:43.990 --> 06:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
of color as they are most affected by it
 
06:22:46.990 --> 06:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
if it is denied we need to support
 
06:22:49.868 --> 06:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
it students and adults should not have
 
06:22:52.390 --> 06:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
to hide their natural hair or conform to
 
06:22:55.270 --> 06:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
standards that are simply preferences
 
06:22:57.430 --> 06:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
that and that don't address a threat or
 
06:22:57.440 --> 06:22:58.750 align:start position:0%
that and that don't address a threat or
inappropriate

06:22:58.750 --> 06:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
06:23:01.190 --> 06:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
behavior preventing them from being
 
06:23:03.948 --> 06:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
themselves may cause unnecessary stress
 
06:23:06.070 --> 06:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
which may also lead to a decrease in
 
06:23:07.750 --> 06:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
school or work
 
06:23:10.110 --> 06:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
performance this creates inequity in
 
06:23:11.468 --> 06:23:11.478 align:start position:0%
schools and the
 
06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
workplace the school system has had many
 
06:23:16.788 --> 06:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
issues with racism and by approving this
 
06:23:19.628 --> 06:23:19.638 align:start position:0%
bill you will contribute to the progress
 
06:23:22.150 --> 06:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
it is making to bring about systemic
 
06:23:24.670 --> 06:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
change in conquered focused on building
 
06:23:27.150 --> 06:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
Equitable Ed educational experiences in

could just give you all some
 
06:25:42.990 --> 06:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
background um about who I am and how I
 
06:25:44.468 --> 06:25:44.478 align:start position:0%
grew up and why this bill means
 
06:25:47.670 --> 06:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
something to me um so when I was growing
 
06:25:51.270 --> 06:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
up I remember watching young actors and
 
06:25:54.190 --> 06:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
performers on television and in film and
 
06:25:57.830 --> 06:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
thinking I want to do that that is
 
06:26:00.190 --> 06:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
really awesome and I was extremely
 
06:26:02.628 --> 06:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
inspired um I remember watching movies
 
06:26:04.350 --> 06:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
like The Sound of Music and thinking I
 
06:26:06.510 --> 06:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
want to sing and dance and act and
 
06:26:10.390 --> 06:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
perform on TV um and have that be my
 
06:26:13.788 --> 06:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
career in high school I performed in
 
06:26:16.830 --> 06:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
theater and on stage um and by the time
 
06:26:19.910 --> 06:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
I got to college I thought theater is
 
06:26:21.628 --> 06:26:21.638 align:start position:0%
going to be the thing that I do for the
 
06:26:24.190 --> 06:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
rest of my life
 
06:26:26.590 --> 06:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
um I became
 
06:26:29.548 --> 06:26:29.558 align:start position:0%
employed at a theater in New Hampshire
 
06:26:31.350 --> 06:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
called Northern Stage it's a regional
 
06:26:35.270 --> 06:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
theater and on my first day of rehearsal
 
06:26:37.468 --> 06:26:37.478 align:start position:0%
I came in with my natural hair and I was
 
06:26:39.070 --> 06:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
extremely excited because I never
 
06:26:41.390 --> 06:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
thought that I would be 18 years old
 
06:26:42.910 --> 06:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
working in a regional theater at that
 
06:26:46.310 --> 06:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
point in my life and the director said
 
06:26:48.948 --> 06:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
to me why did you come with your hair
 
06:26:48.958 --> 06:26:50.110 align:start position:0%
to me why did you come with your hair
like

06:26:50.110 --> 06:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:26:53.708 --> 06:26:53.718 align:start position:0%
that and I said I'm confused I don't
 
06:26:56.430 --> 06:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
understand um and he had explained that
 
06:26:59.590 --> 06:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
because my natural ha so big that nobody
 
06:27:02.310 --> 06:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
could see my face and that the scenes
 
06:27:05.350 --> 06:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
didn't make as much sense and that
 
06:27:07.310 --> 06:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
basically my
 
06:27:11.868 --> 06:27:11.878 align:start position:0%
appearance was impeding the rehearsal
 
06:27:16.190 --> 06:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
process I went home and I had a panic
 
06:27:19.350 --> 06:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
attack I could not believe that me
 
06:27:20.990 --> 06:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
coming into
 
06:27:25.510 --> 06:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
rehearsal just being in my natural state
 
06:27:25.520 --> 06:27:26.788 align:start position:0%
rehearsal just being in my natural state
could

06:27:26.788 --> 06:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:27:29.628 --> 06:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
possibly impede a rehearsal process it
 
06:27:32.830 --> 06:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
it really shocked me the next day when I
 
06:27:33.788 --> 06:27:33.798 align:start position:0%
went into
 
06:27:36.590 --> 06:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
rehearsal I had covered all my hair up
 
06:27:39.788 --> 06:27:39.798 align:start position:0%
and I wore a hood some of my castmates
 
06:27:42.468 --> 06:27:42.478 align:start position:0%
were asking me Stella why did you cover
 
06:27:44.150 --> 06:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
up your hair it's so
 
06:27:47.510 --> 06:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
beautiful and I was too embarrassed to
 
06:27:50.190 --> 06:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
respond I didn't talk about it my
 
06:27:52.910 --> 06:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
director never brought it up again but
 
06:27:55.788 --> 06:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
that experience almost made me
 
06:27:57.670 --> 06:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
never want to do the thing that I had
 
06:28:00.948 --> 06:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
vowed to myself was my dream as a
 
06:28:03.830 --> 06:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
child this was in the state of New
 
06:28:07.190 --> 06:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think a lot of people wonder
 
06:28:10.750 --> 06:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
how black women and bpoc people in New
 
06:28:12.628 --> 06:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can possibly undergo hair
 
06:28:12.638 --> 06:28:14.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can possibly undergo hair
discrimination

06:28:14.510 --> 06:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
06:28:17.310 --> 06:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
and what I have to say to that is
 
06:28:19.468 --> 06:28:19.478 align:start position:0%
anytime there is a black woman in the
 
06:28:22.510 --> 06:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
room anytime there is a bip person in
 
06:28:24.788 --> 06:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
the room who has a hair texture that is
 
06:28:29.948 --> 06:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
not not deemed straight and pretty and
 
06:28:32.750 --> 06:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
to be very honest white hair
 
06:28:35.548 --> 06:28:35.558 align:start position:0%
discrimination is taking
 
06:28:38.868 --> 06:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
place I think that it would mean the
 
06:28:41.868 --> 06:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
world to me and a lot of other young
 
06:28:44.150 --> 06:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
black women and young black people and
 
06:28:45.948 --> 06:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
brown people in New Hampshire for
 
06:28:47.590 --> 06:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
something for a bill like this for
 
06:28:51.070 --> 06:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
something as magnificent
 
06:28:54.350 --> 06:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
and something that actually sees people
 
06:28:56.350 --> 06:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
who look like like me for that to pass
 
06:28:57.670 --> 06:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
in New
 
06:29:00.628 --> 06:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would really be
 
06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
lifechanging I
 
06:29:05.788 --> 06:29:05.798 align:start position:0%
think the goal of my testimony today is
 
06:29:09.468 --> 06:29:09.478 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that race-based
 
06:29:12.708 --> 06:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination is real it is
 
06:29:15.510 --> 06:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
happening it is in the coffee shops that
 
06:29:17.468 --> 06:29:17.478 align:start position:0%
we go into it is in the theaters that we
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
sit in to go and and watch theater when
 
06:29:23.628 --> 06:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
that was happening it is in our schools
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
it is in our colle colleges it's
 
06:29:26.400 --> 06:29:27.948 align:start position:0%
it is in our colle colleges it's
everywhere

06:29:27.948 --> 06:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
06:29:32.868 --> 06:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
um so it would be so magnificent if we
 
06:29:34.310 --> 06:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
could all
 
06:29:39.150 --> 06:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
really read what HB 359 is trying to do
 
06:29:40.750 --> 06:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
and understand
 
06:29:43.510 --> 06:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill could make such a huge
 
06:29:45.548 --> 06:29:45.558 align:start position:0%
difference thank thank you for your
 
06:29:51.390 --> 06:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:51.400 --> 06:29:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
missa

06:29:53.110 --> 06:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
missa
 
06:29:56.868 --> 06:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative MC Beth thank you
 
06:29:59.750 --> 06:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Gordon and thank you um Miss
 
06:30:03.070 --> 06:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
ASA for taking my question um what I'm
 
06:30:05.468 --> 06:30:05.478 align:start position:0%
wondering is
 
06:30:07.990 --> 06:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
um we have this section and it talks
 
06:30:11.230 --> 06:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
about race and protection I'm wondering
 
06:30:14.310 --> 06:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
is it just race or is it also like
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
religion I mean could there be
 
06:30:21.548 --> 06:30:21.558 align:start position:0%
Caucasian dis you know Caucasian Muslims
 
06:30:24.390 --> 06:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
that might be I really don't know and
 
06:30:25.830 --> 06:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
I'm also wondering if it needs to be
 
06:30:28.390 --> 06:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
expanded to race and ethnicity and maybe
 
06:30:30.030 --> 06:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
those aren't fair questions for you but
 
06:30:31.910 --> 06:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm curious just you know you've
 
06:30:35.670 --> 06:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
referred to yourself as by ocp or
 
06:30:37.270 --> 06:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever that acronym was I'd
 
06:30:38.708 --> 06:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
like you to explain that too but those
 
06:30:40.468 --> 06:30:40.478 align:start position:0%
are kind of my questions are is this
 
06:30:42.548 --> 06:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
legislation do are we getting enough of
 
06:30:45.670 --> 06:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
what we need I guess is what asking
 
06:30:48.910 --> 06:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yes um yeah that
 
06:30:50.150 --> 06:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
question definitely makes sense thank
 
06:30:53.110 --> 06:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
you so much for asking um so I will
 
06:30:55.910 --> 06:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
clarify by POC is a term that means
 
06:30:59.430 --> 06:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
black indigenous people of color
 
06:30:59.440 --> 06:31:00.990 align:start position:0%
black indigenous people of color
[Music]

06:31:00.990 --> 06:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:31:02.830 --> 06:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:31:05.590 --> 06:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
think in terms of you asking whether
 
06:31:07.750 --> 06:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
Caucasian Muslims should also have
 
06:31:10.590 --> 06:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
protection under this bill I I I think
 
06:31:12.430 --> 06:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill what it's getting
 
06:31:17.910 --> 06:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
at is to protect people who are by POC
 
06:31:20.670 --> 06:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
who have texturized hair and who use
 
06:31:23.150 --> 06:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
protective styles so I think that the
 
06:31:26.548 --> 06:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
point here is focusing on by PC people
 
06:31:28.310 --> 06:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
who are struggling in the workplace and
 
06:31:32.548 --> 06:31:32.558 align:start position:0%
in schools um to help them get statutory
 
06:31:32.558 --> 06:31:35.310 align:start position:0%
in schools um to help them get statutory
protection

06:31:35.310 --> 06:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
protection
 
06:31:38.510 --> 06:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that thank you
 
06:31:41.708 --> 06:31:41.718 align:start position:0%

06:31:44.958 --> 06:31:46.350 align:start position:0%

can
 
06:31:50.430 --> 06:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
so I really apologize um but what what
 
06:31:52.110 --> 06:31:52.120 align:start position:0%

06:31:54.430 --> 06:31:54.440 align:start position:0%

thank

06:31:55.190 --> 06:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:31:57.750 --> 06:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
so I can just explain to you from my own
 
06:32:00.388 --> 06:32:00.398 align:start position:0%
personal experience so I use protective
 
06:32:02.990 --> 06:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
styles because in the winter time my
 
06:32:05.670 --> 06:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
hair gets really dried out so often I'll
 
06:32:08.590 --> 06:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
put my hair in braids or twists um I
 
06:32:10.788 --> 06:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people who have dreadlocks
 
06:32:13.510 --> 06:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
who um use that as a form of protective
 
06:32:15.830 --> 06:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
style um and all of these Styles you
 
06:32:18.270 --> 06:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
know you go into work and I have
 
06:32:20.350 --> 06:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
experienced at least three or four
 
06:32:21.670 --> 06:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
bosses who have said to me what's on
 
06:32:23.788 --> 06:32:23.798 align:start position:0%
your head what is that you know like
 
06:32:26.628 --> 06:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
why' you come in to work like this um so
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
in short protective styles are yes
 
06:32:34.830 --> 06:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:38.270 --> 06:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
that okay so thank you thank you for
 
06:32:41.868 --> 06:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
your testimony today say something
 
06:32:44.430 --> 06:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
sure I I just as a matter of personal
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
privilege I want to comment to the
 
06:32:47.388 --> 06:32:47.398 align:start position:0%
committee because of pandemic and I
 
06:32:49.190 --> 06:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to get my haircut in a
 
06:32:51.750 --> 06:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
long time I've started braiding my hair
 
06:32:54.110 --> 06:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
at night as I sleep because it gets so
 
06:32:56.230 --> 06:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
long mad added I feel like my mom my
 
06:32:58.430 --> 06:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
kief you know that whole Christmas Story
 
06:33:00.990 --> 06:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
thing it really is true so I just wanted
 
06:33:03.628 --> 06:33:03.638 align:start position:0%
to make that point because generally I I
 
06:33:05.628 --> 06:33:05.638 align:start position:0%
didn't understand and I can relate to it
 
06:33:07.468 --> 06:33:07.478 align:start position:0%
now because my experience has been
 
06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
altered thank you would you believe so I
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
said a y soes mlan so just to follow up
 
06:33:16.750 --> 06:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
on that and maybe you're the right
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
person to answer this question maybe not
 
06:33:20.190 --> 06:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
but this goes back to my earlier
 
06:33:21.590 --> 06:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
question because I'm just trying to
 
06:33:25.310 --> 06:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
understand if two girls apply for a job
 
06:33:28.230 --> 06:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
and they're good friends and one of them
 
06:33:30.750 --> 06:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
is white and one of them is black but
 
06:33:31.910 --> 06:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know because they're two good
 
06:33:35.030 --> 06:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
friends they're both wearing band two
 
06:33:37.948 --> 06:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
knots are is it the intention of this
 
06:33:41.270 --> 06:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
bill that both girls would be equally
 
06:33:44.868 --> 06:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
protected or just uh the girl who that's
 
06:33:47.270 --> 06:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the hair that is a
 
06:33:49.110 --> 06:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
protective hair for her so I'm just
 
06:33:50.948 --> 06:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what is the scope
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
of the bill and maybe you're the right
 
06:33:59.948 --> 06:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:59.958 --> 06:34:02.548 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:34:02.548 --> 06:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:06.860 --> 06:34:06.870 align:start position:0%
well so this is a tough question
 
06:34:06.870 --> 06:34:08.110 align:start position:0%
well so this is a tough question
[Music]

06:34:08.110 --> 06:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:34:11.868 --> 06:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
um because the point of this bill again
 
06:34:15.830 --> 06:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
just to hammer back to my last Point um
 
06:34:19.030 --> 06:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill is to extend
 
06:34:19.040 --> 06:34:20.750 align:start position:0%
the point of this bill is to extend
statutory

06:34:20.750 --> 06:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
06:34:25.670 --> 06:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
protection to by po people who have
 
06:34:28.948 --> 06:34:28.958 align:start position:0%
texturized hair and who are undergoing
 
06:34:28.958 --> 06:34:30.468 align:start position:0%
texturized hair and who are undergoing
race-based

06:34:30.468 --> 06:34:30.478 align:start position:0%
race-based
 
06:34:33.310 --> 06:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination um and so a black woman
 
06:34:35.270 --> 06:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
and a white woman who both have band two
 
06:34:36.708 --> 06:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
knots you see a black woman is going to
 
06:34:39.110 --> 06:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
be received very differently with band
 
06:34:40.868 --> 06:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
two knots than a white woman will be
 
06:34:43.548 --> 06:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
albe it whether or not that white woman
 
06:34:47.190 --> 06:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
was given permission or um I guess the
 
06:34:49.910 --> 06:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
go-ahead to get those band knots but if
 
06:34:52.548 --> 06:34:52.558 align:start position:0%
you all understand what I mean
 
06:34:55.270 --> 06:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
um the fact the fact of the matter is is
 
06:34:57.350 --> 06:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
that when you are a black or brown body
 
06:35:00.788 --> 06:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
and you do have um texturized hair
 
06:35:03.350 --> 06:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's where the Discrimination
 
06:35:09.270 --> 06:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:12.388 --> 06:35:12.398 align:start position:0%

have a testimonial for the bill to be
 
06:36:23.468 --> 06:36:23.478 align:start position:0%

06:36:25.468 --> 06:36:25.478 align:start position:0%
come in to get their their hair done and
 
06:36:28.388 --> 06:36:28.398 align:start position:0%
protective styles and they you know

cellist I would like to do for them but
 
06:36:33.548 --> 06:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
then they tell me no I can't do that
 
06:36:35.388 --> 06:36:35.398 align:start position:0%
because of work my boss wouldn't like
 
06:36:37.548 --> 06:36:37.558 align:start position:0%
this I couldn't have this color or these
 
06:36:40.830 --> 06:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
things and it discouraged them for being
 
06:36:43.750 --> 06:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
themselves when it comes to getting
 
06:36:45.310 --> 06:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
their protective styles a lot of them
 
06:36:46.628 --> 06:36:46.638 align:start position:0%

they can't because they're scared of
 
06:36:55.868 --> 06:36:55.878 align:start position:0%
what Society or the work place to say
 
06:36:59.070 --> 06:36:59.080 align:start position:0%

don't have to go to school because of
 
06:37:41.548 --> 06:37:41.558 align:start position:0%
you know the chemicals and things like
 
06:37:44.468 --> 06:37:44.478 align:start position:0%

06:37:46.310 --> 06:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
could help people that wear their hair
 
06:37:48.990 --> 06:37:49.000 align:start position:0%

get their hair colored or permed and
 
06:37:54.708 --> 06:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
things like that I open the so that we
 
06:37:56.708 --> 06:37:56.718 align:start position:0%

the committee my name is AA B asoa and
 
06:40:35.230 --> 06:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
as the one who developed the legislative
 
06:40:37.910 --> 06:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
strategy for the crown act movement on
 
06:40:39.868 --> 06:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
behalf of the crown Coalition that was
 
06:40:41.750 --> 06:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
co-founded by Dove and the National
 
06:40:43.948 --> 06:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
Urban League and the color of change and
 
06:40:47.270 --> 06:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
others I am here to testify in support
 
06:40:49.868 --> 06:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
of the crown act I will also address
 
06:40:52.070 --> 06:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that I heard and
 
06:40:54.750 --> 06:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to add Clarity regarding the
 
06:40:58.430 --> 06:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
intent there is a longstanding history
 
06:41:01.388 --> 06:41:01.398 align:start position:0%
and problematic practice of racial
 
06:41:03.388 --> 06:41:03.398 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on hair in the
 
06:41:05.750 --> 06:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
United States there have been countless
 
06:41:07.628 --> 06:41:07.638 align:start position:0%
cases where black people have been
 
06:41:09.350 --> 06:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
discriminated against for wearing
 
06:41:13.310 --> 06:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
natural here and or protective styles
 
06:41:16.548 --> 06:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to braids
 
06:41:22.548 --> 06:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
locks twist band two knots afro Etc this
 
06:41:24.510 --> 06:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
prevalent form of discre discrimination
 
06:41:28.388 --> 06:41:28.398 align:start position:0%
includes being fired passed over for
 
06:41:31.628 --> 06:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
promotions and even having offers of
 
06:41:34.788 --> 06:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
employment rescinded it impacts the
 
06:41:37.030 --> 06:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
upward mobility of individuals and
 
06:41:39.948 --> 06:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
families who have are impacted and it
 
06:41:41.788 --> 06:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
has been the reason far too many
 
06:41:44.350 --> 06:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
children have miss school and had
 
06:41:47.230 --> 06:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
negative educational experiences as I
 
06:41:49.468 --> 06:41:49.478 align:start position:0%
think about the work I've done over at
 
06:41:51.670 --> 06:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
the local state and federal levels I
 
06:41:54.150 --> 06:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
think about a dynamic student Faith
 
06:41:56.350 --> 06:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
finity in Louisiana who was sent home
 
06:41:59.190 --> 06:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
literally in tears because she wore
 
06:42:00.948 --> 06:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
beautiful braids that were deemed a
 
06:42:03.548 --> 06:42:03.558 align:start position:0%
violation of school rules I think about
 
06:42:06.030 --> 06:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
DeAndre Arnold in Texas who was told he
 
06:42:08.990 --> 06:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
could not participate in his high school
 
06:42:12.590 --> 06:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
graduation ceremony with his friends due
 
06:42:16.230 --> 06:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
to Locks a display of cultural Pride I
 
06:42:18.110 --> 06:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
think about people all over who
 
06:42:20.788 --> 06:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
collectively gasp witnessing Andrew
 
06:42:23.430 --> 06:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
Johnson a student wrestler in New Jersey
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
before forced to make a decision he
 
06:42:27.590 --> 06:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
should have never been tasked with
 
06:42:30.670 --> 06:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
making and to choose between having his
 
06:42:34.270 --> 06:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
locks cut and his identity attacked or
 
06:42:36.388 --> 06:42:36.398 align:start position:0%
forfeiting a match he had earned the
 
06:42:39.468 --> 06:42:39.478 align:start position:0%
right to participate in based on Talent
 
06:42:42.070 --> 06:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
the psychological impact of being told
 
06:42:44.310 --> 06:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
essentially that the way you were born
 
06:42:48.030 --> 06:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
is not okay is something people should
 
06:42:51.110 --> 06:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
not have to endure as a licensed
 
06:42:53.270 --> 06:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
clinician an applied behavior analyst by
 
06:42:55.830 --> 06:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
training I should also share the damage
 
06:42:59.270 --> 06:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
to one's self-esteem can be
 
06:43:01.948 --> 06:43:01.958 align:start position:0%
longstanding and perceptions of self
 
06:43:05.030 --> 06:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
worth can be impacted all in ways that
 
06:43:08.310 --> 06:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
again shouldn't exist the issue of
 
06:43:10.310 --> 06:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
narrow beauty standards in America
 
06:43:12.830 --> 06:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
continue to perpetuate
 
06:43:16.830 --> 06:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
inequity unfair scrutiny Injustice and
 
06:43:19.030 --> 06:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination in workplaces and schools
 
06:43:21.590 --> 06:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
the crown coalition's work is focused on
 
06:43:23.948 --> 06:43:23.958 align:start position:0%
the workplace as well as school schools
 
06:43:25.750 --> 06:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
and places where public accommodations
 
06:43:28.910 --> 06:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
are provided those are all against black
 
06:43:33.310 --> 06:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
people and it warrants a legislative fix
 
06:43:35.830 --> 06:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
the crown act as the Coalition defines
 
06:43:39.910 --> 06:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
it simply amends the existing definition
 
06:43:43.110 --> 06:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
of race which is an existing protected
 
06:43:46.430 --> 06:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
class it amends that definition of race
 
06:43:49.788 --> 06:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
to include traits historically
 
06:43:54.110 --> 06:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
associated with it such as hair teex
 
06:43:56.350 --> 06:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
and or protective
 
06:43:59.110 --> 06:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
styles while some anti-discrimination
 
06:44:01.190 --> 06:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
laws currently protect the choice to
 
06:44:04.510 --> 06:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
wear an afro afros are not the only
 
06:44:07.430 --> 06:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
natural presentation or style of black
 
06:44:11.070 --> 06:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
hair the crown act ures protection
 
06:44:13.750 --> 06:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
against discrimination based on
 
06:44:16.628 --> 06:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
hairstyles by extending statutory
 
06:44:19.030 --> 06:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
protection to hair texture and
 
06:44:22.110 --> 06:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
protective styles for this reason I
 
06:44:24.548 --> 06:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
support the crown act as I reference and
 
06:44:27.830 --> 06:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
without exception to address some of the
 
06:44:30.110 --> 06:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
issues that I heard presented before I
 
06:44:31.868 --> 06:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
was able to
 
06:44:36.190 --> 06:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
testify race is not defined we know that
 
06:44:39.590 --> 06:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
there is no biological basis for race it
 
06:44:44.468 --> 06:44:44.478 align:start position:0%
is a social construct yet racism is
 
06:44:47.030 --> 06:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
undeniable regarding whether this bill
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
would cover as the crown Coalition
 
06:44:53.070 --> 06:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
defines it white people an example of
 
06:44:56.510 --> 06:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
how bill would protect white people is
 
06:44:58.590 --> 06:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
not just you know if a black person and
 
06:45:00.468 --> 06:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
a white person has the same hairstyle we
 
06:45:02.590 --> 06:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
show up we determine who you know gets
 
06:45:07.070 --> 06:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
the job not that for example the a a
 
06:45:10.388 --> 06:45:10.398 align:start position:0%
witness who testified before me shared
 
06:45:11.628 --> 06:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
having a
 
06:45:16.468 --> 06:45:16.478 align:start position:0%
salon if I have a braiding
 
06:45:20.230 --> 06:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
salon and a white person is working in
 
06:45:22.830 --> 06:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
the braiding salon and the white person
 
06:45:27.270 --> 06:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
is told you must conform by changing
 
06:45:30.270 --> 06:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
your natural hair to wear locks or
 
06:45:34.030 --> 06:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
twists or BTO knots Etc the crown act
 
06:45:36.070 --> 06:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
would then protect you because you are
 
06:45:39.430 --> 06:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
told that told that you must change your
 
06:45:41.990 --> 06:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
natural presentation of your hair in
 
06:45:45.030 --> 06:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
order to have the job regarding whether
 
06:45:47.670 --> 06:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
or not this bill covers religion
 
06:45:50.948 --> 06:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
religion is its own protected class the
 
06:45:54.230 --> 06:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
crown Act is simply a amending the
 
06:45:56.628 --> 06:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
existing definition of race in full
 
06:45:59.350 --> 06:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that it is a social
 
06:46:02.270 --> 06:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
construct to include the traits that are
 
06:46:04.948 --> 06:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
historically associated with it I am
 
06:46:09.628 --> 06:46:09.638 align:start position:0%
looking at a screen with 11 people if I
 
06:46:12.030 --> 06:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
ask you all to define race I would
 
06:46:14.830 --> 06:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
probably have 11 different answers we
 
06:46:17.868 --> 06:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
could probably agree on what toppings we
 
06:46:20.310 --> 06:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
would like to go on a pizza before we
 
06:46:23.670 --> 06:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
can agree on the definition of race
 
06:46:26.548 --> 06:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
again there's no biological basis for it
 
06:46:29.670 --> 06:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
it is something that is assumed so
 
06:46:32.110 --> 06:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
because it is an existing protected
 
06:46:35.388 --> 06:46:35.398 align:start position:0%
class we are simply saying amend that
 
06:46:38.468 --> 06:46:38.478 align:start position:0%
definition of race to include the traits
 
06:46:41.910 --> 06:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
that are historically associated with it
 
06:46:44.230 --> 06:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
hairstyle by mere definition is
 
06:46:46.670 --> 06:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
something that is mutable race however
 
06:46:49.788 --> 06:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
is not I will I'm born and I'll die the
 
06:46:52.350 --> 06:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
same race again we don't agree on what
 
06:46:54.990 --> 06:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
it necessarily is is but it's something
 
06:46:58.190 --> 06:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
that is assumed so what we are seeking
 
06:47:02.830 --> 06:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
to do is ex to provide
 
06:47:06.948 --> 06:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
explicitly protection for those who may
 
06:47:08.990 --> 06:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
be on the receiving end of hair
 
06:47:11.548 --> 06:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
discrimination which we are defining as
 
06:47:15.150 --> 06:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
race based discrimination so we are
 
06:47:18.030 --> 06:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
simply seeking to Outlaw hair
 
06:47:21.230 --> 06:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on race which is an
 
06:47:23.948 --> 06:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
existing protected class so so we're not
 
06:47:25.830 --> 06:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
attempting to create a new protected
 
06:47:28.990 --> 06:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
class we are not attempting to conflate
 
06:47:31.110 --> 06:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
it with religion which is also a
 
06:47:33.830 --> 06:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
protected class we are simply saying
 
06:47:36.310 --> 06:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
whatever people think race is amend the
 
06:47:39.190 --> 06:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
definition of it to include those traits
 
06:47:41.830 --> 06:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
that are historically associated with it
 
06:47:45.230 --> 06:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
such as hair texture and hair styles I
 
06:47:49.030 --> 06:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:52.670 --> 06:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
sharing protecting civil rights is not a
 
06:47:55.350 --> 06:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
partisan issue we do not view this as a
 
06:47:57.350 --> 06:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
partisan issue it should not be the
 
06:47:59.708 --> 06:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility of any one particular
 
06:48:02.788 --> 06:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
party or anybody of one particular race
 
06:48:05.910 --> 06:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the civil rights of people as
 
06:48:09.910 --> 06:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
it stands now hair is not covered under
 
06:48:11.788 --> 06:48:11.798 align:start position:0%
the current classification of race and
 
06:48:13.670 --> 06:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
we are seeking to do that and I'm happy
 
06:48:15.430 --> 06:48:15.440 align:start position:0%

06:48:17.388 --> 06:48:17.398 align:start position:0%

06:48:19.110 --> 06:48:19.120 align:start position:0%

excuse me thank you your honor I mean Mr
 
06:48:29.510 --> 06:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um so thank you I really
 
06:48:31.270 --> 06:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate you clarifying some of the
 
06:48:33.430 --> 06:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
comments that questions that I had
 
06:48:37.910 --> 06:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
before and um I'm also wondering because
 
06:48:41.430 --> 06:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
hair okay and this might expose my bias
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
or privilege or whatever but hair
 
06:48:46.230 --> 06:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
interest in hair seems something that is
 
06:48:48.110 --> 06:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
particularly something that women are
 
06:48:50.468 --> 06:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
more interested in perhaps than men I
 
06:48:53.230 --> 06:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
mean at least understanding I'm just
 
06:48:55.708 --> 06:48:55.718 align:start position:0%
wondering is this um uh is
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on um hair texture
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
and hairstyle is this something that
 
06:49:04.628 --> 06:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
impacts one sex more than the one gender
 
06:49:07.310 --> 06:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
more than the other yes it
 
06:49:09.708 --> 06:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacts black women
 
06:49:11.030 --> 06:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
although not
 
06:49:13.548 --> 06:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
exclusively I mentioned two three
 
06:49:16.708 --> 06:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
students of of who two of them are are
 
06:49:19.830 --> 06:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
male and so yes it disproportionately
 
06:49:22.190 --> 06:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
impacts black women although not
 
06:49:24.990 --> 06:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
exclusively it also impacts black men
 
06:49:26.910 --> 06:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
and of course our
 
06:49:30.310 --> 06:49:30.320 align:start position:0%

Incorporated
 
06:50:21.590 --> 06:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so I have two things that I would
 
06:50:23.670 --> 06:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
like to share with you all the first is
 
06:50:26.190 --> 06:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
I did a professional development program
 
06:50:32.030 --> 06:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
um my junior year of college and um it
 
06:50:34.230 --> 06:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
was a great professional development
 
06:50:36.230 --> 06:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
program it taught us about things
 
06:50:38.510 --> 06:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
ranging from you know how to fix up our
 
06:50:41.788 --> 06:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
resumés to like our cover letters to
 
06:50:44.788 --> 06:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
what should the interview look like and
 
06:50:47.310 --> 06:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
um like networking basically getting us
 
06:50:51.868 --> 06:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
ready for um uh Life After College and
 
06:50:55.868 --> 06:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
internships and applying the jobs um and
 
06:50:57.590 --> 06:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
it was very valuable and it was really
 
06:51:01.110 --> 06:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
competitive too um this particular
 
06:51:05.430 --> 06:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
program it was it was for black
 
06:51:09.868 --> 06:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
women and um there came up a a point in
 
06:51:12.070 --> 06:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
the the program where someone act we
 
06:51:14.708 --> 06:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
were talking about um basically the
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
interview like obviously like what to
 
06:51:17.670 --> 06:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
say in the interview how do you
 
06:51:19.468 --> 06:51:19.478 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself like what questions
 
06:51:21.830 --> 06:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
to ask things like that and then it was
 
06:51:23.190 --> 06:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
we then we started to talk about like
 
06:51:26.110 --> 06:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
what to wear to the interview and the a
 
06:51:28.750 --> 06:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
matter of here was brought up and the
 
06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
woman that was advising
 
06:51:36.830 --> 06:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
us um she was a black woman and she um
 
06:51:39.350 --> 06:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
she Bally advised us
 
06:51:43.510 --> 06:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
to not wear afro to the
 
06:51:46.628 --> 06:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
interview um just because she felt that
 
06:51:46.638 --> 06:51:48.270 align:start position:0%
interview um just because she felt that
you

06:51:48.270 --> 06:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
know you're the the likeliness of us
 
06:51:52.708 --> 06:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
getting the interview that us wearing
 
06:51:54.388 --> 06:51:54.398 align:start position:0%
can hinder our chances of actually
 
06:51:55.590 --> 06:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
getting in the interview and getting
 
06:51:58.150 --> 06:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
past that stage and she said that it's
 
06:52:00.628 --> 06:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
once you actually once you get into like
 
06:52:02.190 --> 06:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
a job and you're actually you've already
 
06:52:03.910 --> 06:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
like kind of proven yourself that that's
 
06:52:05.310 --> 06:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
when you can kind of Branch out and
 
06:52:06.670 --> 06:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
that's when you can actually wear your
 
06:52:10.910 --> 06:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
hair now I would say like half of us
 
06:52:14.030 --> 06:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
were natural in the room including
 
06:52:18.548 --> 06:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
myself and I raised my hand and I had a
 
06:52:20.990 --> 06:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question and my question was
 
06:52:23.548 --> 06:52:23.558 align:start position:0%
why is it that the hair hair that grows
 
06:52:26.468 --> 06:52:26.478 align:start position:0%
naturally out of my head why can't I why
 
06:52:29.468 --> 06:52:29.478 align:start position:0%
do I have to go spend money to do my
 
06:52:32.110 --> 06:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
hair for the interview or like why do I
 
06:52:34.670 --> 06:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
have to straighten my hair which I
 
06:52:37.230 --> 06:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
haven't straightened my hair in several
 
06:52:38.910 --> 06:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
years since I first went natural in
 
06:52:42.868 --> 06:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
middle school and I'm I'm 20 21 now um
 
06:52:43.948 --> 06:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
so that was when I last time I
 
06:52:44.830 --> 06:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
straightened my hair was probably like
 
06:52:47.830 --> 06:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
when I was 12 or 13 I don't put heat on
 
06:52:47.840 --> 06:52:48.590 align:start position:0%
when I was 12 or 13 I don't put heat on
my

06:52:48.590 --> 06:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:52:51.310 --> 06:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
hair and she basically advised us that
 
06:52:54.310 --> 06:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
we have to like do that in order to even
 
06:52:55.468 --> 06:52:55.478 align:start position:0%
try to get the
 
06:52:58.270 --> 06:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
interview um and so even after I I
 
06:52:59.628 --> 06:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
protested she was something that she
 
06:53:01.548 --> 06:53:01.558 align:start position:0%
really stand stood by and she really
 
06:53:04.310 --> 06:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
advised us just for our best interest um
 
06:53:07.270 --> 06:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
to do that and then the second thing I
 
06:53:11.230 --> 06:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
to share is um missero I don't want to
 
06:53:12.468 --> 06:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
cut you off but we I don't know if you
 
06:53:13.868 --> 06:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
heard at the beginning we tried to keep
 
06:53:15.750 --> 06:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony to three minutes if you
 
06:53:17.510 --> 06:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
could if so if you could sum up that
 
06:53:20.830 --> 06:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
would be great okay I was just gonna say
 
06:53:23.948 --> 06:53:23.958 align:start position:0%
that um my experience um in Hanover New
 
06:53:26.430 --> 06:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that I've been constantly
 
06:53:30.990 --> 06:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
told um to not wear my natur that my
 
06:53:33.708 --> 06:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
natural hair is unacceptable that it's
 
06:53:36.430 --> 06:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
unruly even with protective styles like
 
06:53:40.430 --> 06:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
when I I have a job often like I get a
 
06:53:41.708 --> 06:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
lot of comments that make me feel
 
06:53:44.948 --> 06:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable at my job in Handover
 
06:53:47.830 --> 06:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
because of my braids um from Handover
 
06:53:50.310 --> 06:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
residence um and so that's that I would
 
06:53:51.628 --> 06:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
say those are my two experiences I feel
 
06:53:54.150 --> 06:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
like this bill is extremely important
 
06:53:59.110 --> 06:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
for for residents of New Hampshire so
 
06:54:02.948 --> 06:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
that we are not filled we are not
 
06:54:05.430 --> 06:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
um basically made to feel like the way
 
06:54:07.548 --> 06:54:07.558 align:start position:0%
we are naturally is
 
06:54:10.430 --> 06:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriate um I think it's unfair and
 
06:54:12.990 --> 06:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's really important that um we
 
06:54:15.708 --> 06:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
pass this Bill thank thank you for your
 
06:54:17.788 --> 06:54:17.798 align:start position:0%
testimony are there there questions from
 
06:54:17.798 --> 06:54:19.830 align:start position:0%
testimony are there there questions from

testimony and let's go back and see if
 
06:54:29.708 --> 06:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
we can find zo on yango I think she was
 
06:54:38.430 --> 06:54:38.440 align:start position:0%

06:54:46.070 --> 06:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
school student and I've lived in New
 
06:54:48.430 --> 06:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for my entire life and I'm
 
06:54:51.150 --> 06:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
here to testify and support the HB
 
06:54:53.948 --> 06:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
359 um my experience with my hair has
 
06:54:56.948 --> 06:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
been very different since we live in a
 
06:54:59.590 --> 06:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
very uh prominently White Community I
 
06:55:01.230 --> 06:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
I've always felt like I had to conform
 
06:55:05.910 --> 06:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
to something that I'm not um so I as
 
06:55:07.750 --> 06:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo mentioned I
 
06:55:10.190 --> 06:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
got a perm and I straightened my hair
 
06:55:11.868 --> 06:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
hoping that maybe I'd fit in better
 
06:55:13.910 --> 06:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
maybe I'd blend in better and hope that
 
06:55:16.388 --> 06:55:16.398 align:start position:0%
maybe if I erase this aspect of myself
 
06:55:18.350 --> 06:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'd be liked more I'd fit in classes
 
06:55:20.430 --> 06:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
more and I wouldn't receive the stairs
 
06:55:23.868 --> 06:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
that I got when I used to wear my braids
 
06:55:25.708 --> 06:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
um as representative D Lorenzo has
 
06:55:28.430 --> 06:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
explained these chemical perms actually
 
06:55:30.788 --> 06:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
chemically damage hair straightening
 
06:55:33.830 --> 06:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
hair um actually destroys the double
 
06:55:38.230 --> 06:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
helix pattern of black hair and so heat
 
06:55:40.868 --> 06:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
is not meant for black hair um perms are
 
06:55:42.150 --> 06:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
not meant for black hair but they're
 
06:55:44.150 --> 06:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
simply methods used to make us conform
 
06:55:47.070 --> 06:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
to something that we simply are not and
 
06:55:50.030 --> 06:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
so I feel like passing this act would
 
06:55:52.270 --> 06:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
allow people to exist as who they are
 
06:55:53.990 --> 06:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
and let them know that who they are
 
06:55:57.190 --> 06:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be changed as a means to
 
06:55:58.948 --> 06:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
um conform to an identity that they
 
06:56:02.150 --> 06:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
simply are not um thank you for my
 
06:56:03.750 --> 06:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for hearing my
 
06:56:07.868 --> 06:56:07.878 align:start position:0%

06:57:08.030 --> 06:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
I went to school um in Manchester I went

to school um in conquer at the high
 
06:57:15.750 --> 06:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
school at Bishop Brady and I have a I
 
06:57:17.990 --> 06:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
have keen and clear memories of the
 
06:57:20.190 --> 06:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
number of times that I have had to I
 
06:57:22.830 --> 06:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
have gotten detentions for being quote
 
06:57:26.468 --> 06:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
unquote out of dress code um and I have
 
06:57:31.468 --> 06:57:31.478 align:start position:0%
a long list of of stories of being going
 
06:57:33.110 --> 06:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
out into the workforce and having to
 
06:57:35.948 --> 06:57:35.958 align:start position:0%
field um a lot of inappropriate comments
 
06:57:39.150 --> 06:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
as well as um questions about whether my
 
06:57:40.388 --> 06:57:40.398 align:start position:0%
hair was appropriate even though it
 
06:57:44.628 --> 06:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
looked very nice um and so I wanted to
 
06:57:46.628 --> 06:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
to First Echo all of the things that the
 
06:57:48.948 --> 06:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
incredible Witnesses before me have come
 
06:57:51.230 --> 06:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
um to to speak of and to really urge the
 
06:57:53.190 --> 06:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
committee to understand that New
 
06:57:56.430 --> 06:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oftentimes in New Hampshire um
 
06:57:58.030 --> 06:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
it is often thought that New Hampshire
 
06:58:01.430 --> 06:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have uh behaviors or doesn't
 
06:58:04.270 --> 06:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
experience um instances of U racial
 
06:58:06.070 --> 06:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination discrimination or
 
06:58:08.868 --> 06:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
race-based um uh uh treatment and I
 
06:58:10.030 --> 06:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
think it is really important as someone
 
06:58:11.670 --> 06:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
who has lived in this state since she
 
06:58:13.190 --> 06:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
was three years old has went to school
 
06:58:16.030 --> 06:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
here has experienced it for it to be uh
 
06:58:17.910 --> 06:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
well known that these things do happen
 
06:58:20.750 --> 06:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
and a bill like this goes a long way to
 
06:58:22.628 --> 06:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
communicating the the values that New
 
06:58:25.110 --> 06:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire says that we are which is a
 
06:58:27.830 --> 06:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
community a family based Community one
 
06:58:29.750 --> 06:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
that rallies for one another and shows
 
06:58:31.350 --> 06:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
up for each other and I think that these
 
06:58:33.150 --> 06:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
are one of the ways that our legislature
 
06:58:35.310 --> 06:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
and our lawmakers can certainly and
 
06:58:37.430 --> 06:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
signal and be made real clear that when
 
06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
we say that we are an inclusive
 
06:58:40.350 --> 06:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
community that we say we are an
 
06:58:44.628 --> 06:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
inclusive State we have the the teeth um
 
06:58:46.670 --> 06:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
to back that up thank you and I'm happy
 
06:58:49.548 --> 06:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank
 
06:58:53.230 --> 06:58:53.240 align:start position:0%

06:58:53.240 --> 06:58:54.868 align:start position:0%

06:59:11.230 --> 06:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much my name is
 
06:59:13.628 --> 06:59:13.638 align:start position:0%
Joseph laskas I will be representing the
 
06:59:15.590 --> 06:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union of New
 
06:59:18.190 --> 06:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I just wanted to note that
 
06:59:20.910 --> 06:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
we do support the intent of this bill we
 
06:59:23.430 --> 06:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
did have concerns with the exclusion of
 
06:59:24.990 --> 06:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
residents at the Department of
 
06:59:27.230 --> 06:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
Corrections um and I just wanted to
 
06:59:28.910 --> 06:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
point after all the testimony that we've
 
06:59:32.150 --> 06:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
heard today um individuals shouldn't be
 
06:59:34.070 --> 06:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
discriminated against uh just because
 
06:59:35.788 --> 06:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
they may have made a mistake in the
 
06:59:38.548 --> 06:59:38.558 align:start position:0%
community that that landed them um
 
06:59:41.910 --> 06:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so uh for that reason and
 
06:59:44.468 --> 06:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that um we've been
 
06:59:46.350 --> 06:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
having promising conversations with the
 
06:59:48.190 --> 06:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections on some of the
 
06:59:49.708 --> 06:59:49.718 align:start position:0%
changes that they are making to
 
06:59:52.910 --> 06:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
accompany um this hairstyle
 
06:59:56.070 --> 06:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh we we wanted to note the concerns
 
06:59:58.750 --> 06:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
over the exclusion of residents and I
 
07:00:02.270 --> 07:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
did want to say that um uh when the
 
07:00:05.150 --> 07:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
concerns were raised over the residents
 
07:00:06.590 --> 07:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Corrections this
 
07:00:09.830 --> 07:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
was a security concern that was talking
 
07:00:14.628 --> 07:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
about specifically people um having gang
 
07:00:17.388 --> 07:00:17.398 align:start position:0%
appearance within their hairstyles not
 
07:00:19.548 --> 07:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
the natural hairstyles itself so I I did
 
07:00:20.788 --> 07:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
want to highlight that that was a
 
07:00:23.388 --> 07:00:23.398 align:start position:0%
difference and a blinket exclusion is
 
07:00:25.190 --> 07:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
actually still discriminating against
 
07:00:27.190 --> 07:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
people and it would be discriminating
 
07:00:29.830 --> 07:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
specifically against people of color
 
07:00:31.350 --> 07:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will I'm happy to answer
 
07:00:34.030 --> 07:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have thank you are
 
07:00:37.868 --> 07:00:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:41.548 --> 07:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
Sky seeing none thank you for your your
 
07:00:43.990 --> 07:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
succinct and thoughtful
 
07:00:51.030 --> 07:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:54.150 --> 07:00:54.160 align:start position:0%

07:00:54.160 --> 07:00:55.110 align:start position:0%

07:00:55.110 --> 07:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
07:00:58.910 --> 07:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
can hi everyone thank you for for being
 
07:01:00.468 --> 07:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
here and thanks for allowing me to speak
 
07:01:03.708 --> 07:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
on this issue uh I'm here to testify in
 
07:01:06.708 --> 07:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
support of passing this bill and I can
 
07:01:09.910 --> 07:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
give you a couple examples of why um I
 
07:01:13.670 --> 07:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
am a junior at Dartmouth College I am
 
07:01:17.388 --> 07:01:17.398 align:start position:0%
also a black woman and I am also an army
 
07:01:19.310 --> 07:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
veteran and
 
07:01:22.110 --> 07:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
reservist I do want to point out that
 
07:01:25.310 --> 07:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
that just last month the United States
 
07:01:28.430 --> 07:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
Army for the first time in its history
 
07:01:31.388 --> 07:01:31.398 align:start position:0%
included protected hairstyles and
 
07:01:33.948 --> 07:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
defended black women's ability to wear
 
07:01:36.150 --> 07:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
those hairstyles in
 
07:01:37.948 --> 07:01:37.958 align:start position:0%
uniform this
 
07:01:40.910 --> 07:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
year it was a big step towards inclusion
 
07:01:43.350 --> 07:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
and it was a big step towards in in
 
07:01:46.270 --> 07:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
increasing representation of protected
 
07:01:48.110 --> 07:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
classes in our
 
07:01:50.788 --> 07:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
military I would go further to say that
 
07:01:52.468 --> 07:01:52.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a beautiful
 
07:01:55.788 --> 07:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
place I think more people had if they
 
07:01:57.868 --> 07:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
had the chance to come to New Hampshire
 
07:02:00.430 --> 07:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
would agree with me and I think this is
 
07:02:03.030 --> 07:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
a meaningful step towards signaling to
 
07:02:04.750 --> 07:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of our country that New
 
07:02:06.830 --> 07:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a place where people can
 
07:02:09.310 --> 07:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
come to be
 
07:02:12.270 --> 07:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
themselves as a black woman I have been
 
07:02:14.310 --> 07:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
forced to do all kinds of things to my
 
07:02:17.910 --> 07:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
hair not just to be considered
 
07:02:19.830 --> 07:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
professional in a workplace in a
 
07:02:23.948 --> 07:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
corporate space or in a courthouse
 
07:02:25.948 --> 07:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
I was not able to wear my hair in its
 
07:02:27.788 --> 07:02:27.798 align:start position:0%
natural hairstyle while I was in the
 
07:02:30.868 --> 07:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
United States Army uniform
 
07:02:34.750 --> 07:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
either to be clear one identity isn't
 
07:02:36.270 --> 07:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
privileged over the
 
07:02:38.990 --> 07:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
other what we're in a time right now
 
07:02:41.110 --> 07:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
where even the United States government
 
07:02:43.430 --> 07:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
and Military are
 
07:02:45.788 --> 07:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this is a necessary
 
07:02:48.548 --> 07:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
step towards protecting people who have
 
07:02:50.868 --> 07:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
not been granted protections
 
07:02:50.878 --> 07:02:54.708 align:start position:0%
not been granted protections
before

07:02:54.708 --> 07:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:56.830 --> 07:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
I cannot tell you what it's
 
07:02:59.310 --> 07:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
like to be on a
 
07:03:02.830 --> 07:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
deployment and have to shower more often
 
07:03:05.430 --> 07:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
straighten my hair more often and find
 
07:03:08.150 --> 07:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
time to comply with standards that are
 
07:03:11.670 --> 07:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
relatively impossible when it is 115
 
07:03:11.680 --> 07:03:12.750 align:start position:0%
relatively impossible when it is 115
degrees

07:03:12.750 --> 07:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
degrees
 
07:03:15.590 --> 07:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
outside but I did
 
07:03:18.670 --> 07:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
it those situations don't change when
 
07:03:21.670 --> 07:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
you have a black woman in New Hampshire
 
07:03:23.030 --> 07:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
who who needs to treat her hair a
 
07:03:25.230 --> 07:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
certain way because it's I think it got
 
07:03:29.070 --> 07:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
down to like below four last
 
07:03:32.150 --> 07:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
night these issues are causing
 
07:03:35.230 --> 07:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
harm now people are complying with them
 
07:03:36.990 --> 07:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes for high ideals like the
 
07:03:38.948 --> 07:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
freedom we all want and fight for for
 
07:03:41.310 --> 07:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
our country other times they're fighting
 
07:03:43.070 --> 07:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
for ideals like Independence and
 
07:03:44.948 --> 07:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
supporting their family through the
 
07:03:48.150 --> 07:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
their pride in their work I don't think
 
07:03:50.190 --> 07:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
it's fair to burden these
 
07:03:53.628 --> 07:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
people with
 
07:03:57.110 --> 07:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
racist attitudes towards their
 
07:03:59.628 --> 07:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
hair that's all I have to say I'm happy
 
07:04:02.708 --> 07:04:02.718 align:start position:0%

07:04:03.910 --> 07:04:03.920 align:start position:0%

pretty much my whole life my mom's also
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
she's a city councelor in Lebanon um so
 
07:04:59.350 --> 07:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
I've been pretty involved I guess with
 
07:05:02.230 --> 07:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and the the community there and
 
07:05:05.150 --> 07:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
I am also um biracial so I'm a black
 
07:05:07.070 --> 07:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
woman and I've lived in New Hampshire my
 
07:05:09.990 --> 07:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
whole life and I was very excited to um
 
07:05:11.750 --> 07:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
I guess speak with all of you today and
 
07:05:14.788 --> 07:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
just offer my um support on this bill I
 
07:05:17.190 --> 07:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
think this I was incredibly happy to see
 
07:05:18.910 --> 07:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
that this is kind of an issue that's
 
07:05:21.910 --> 07:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
being discussed with all of you today um
 
07:05:23.948 --> 07:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
especially I think now with Co and just
 
07:05:25.110 --> 07:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
all the discussions that we've been
 
07:05:27.350 --> 07:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
having both at the state and um the
 
07:05:30.070 --> 07:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
national level I am really encouraged to
 
07:05:31.468 --> 07:05:31.478 align:start position:0%
see that this is a discussion that's
 
07:05:33.468 --> 07:05:33.478 align:start position:0%
being had um and hopefully a bill
 
07:05:35.910 --> 07:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
that'll be passed because I think um
 
07:05:37.310 --> 07:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
mean especially for me personally I've
 
07:05:39.750 --> 07:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
done every every uh every every
 
07:05:41.788 --> 07:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
thinkable thing to my hair to kind of
 
07:05:44.590 --> 07:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
fit in at times um and I think now I
 
07:05:46.788 --> 07:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
really I wear my hair natural especially
 
07:05:48.830 --> 07:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
in any Dartmouth and in any work
 
07:05:50.230 --> 07:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
environment and I think that this is
 
07:05:53.430 --> 07:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
really um important both from a from a
 
07:05:56.430 --> 07:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
legal protection uh perspective and also
 
07:05:58.990 --> 07:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
just really important um to set a
 
07:06:01.590 --> 07:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
precedent and to really show um to every
 
07:06:03.350 --> 07:06:03.360 align:start position:0%

07:06:10.070 --> 07:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
