hello I'm Eric Gallagher the
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative from Concord Ward 6 which
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
is Merrimack County District 20 and I
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
rise today to speak in support of House
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
Bill 95 an act enabling municipalities

to adopt rental practice regulations so
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
s has was mentioned previously in the pi
 
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
we're in the housing and homelessness
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
crisis in this state so
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
how do people become homeless well one
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
of the ways
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
or one of one of the major drivers of
 
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
homelessness is when their landlords
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
evict them
 
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
and one of the things when I hear
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
when talking with constituents about our
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
housing and homelessness crisis is that
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're tired of their landlords raising
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
their rent on them
 
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
housing is a basic necessity for
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
everyone and the quality of housing can
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
have a significant impact on the health
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
and well-being of residents
 
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.450 align:start position:0%
and well-being of residents
um I

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
some of the constituents I've talked
 
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:25.940 align:start position:0%
with have actually had to move
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
I've I've lost neighbors due to being
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
driven out of conquered by Rising rents
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and we we've even had a school board
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
member here in Concord who's had to step
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
down from the school board
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
because she was evicted and then no was
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
no longer domiciled in the district that
 
00:25:53.649 --> 00:25:53.659 align:start position:0%
she was supposed to be resent
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
representing so
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
with the large number of renters in my
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
district I decided to sign on to this
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
legislation as a co-sponsor to stand up
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about what this
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
legislation does specifically it's
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that enables
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt rental practice
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
regulations so the first part of that
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
being enabling legislation we're not
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
forcing any
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
rental practice regulations we're merely
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
giving them the choice of whether they
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
want to do so or not
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
if rental practice regulations aren't a
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
good choice for a community then they
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
so yes I'm sure you've heard many times
 
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a Dylan rule state
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
rather than a home rule state so we have
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
to ask the legislature explicitly vote
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:12.169 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
I apologize for that representative
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
the house will settle down you may
 
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.590 align:start position:0%
the house will settle down you may
continue

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.909 align:start position:0%
continue
um

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
so Ray I was talking about
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
um the whole part about enabling
 
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.909 align:start position:0%
um the whole part about enabling
legislation

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
legislation
um

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's the enabling legislation
 
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.190 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's the enabling legislation
part

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
as for the rental practice regulus
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
regulations part that might sound like
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
it's just a fancier term for rent
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
control but that's really just a small
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
part of
um

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
what falls under here it can also
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
include regulations on the notice given
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
before rent increases among other things
 
00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:56.690 align:start position:0%
before rent increases among other things
um

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
so let's address some of the
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
points raised in opposition to this bill
 
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.789 align:start position:0%
points raised in opposition to this bill
um

00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
one is that it would constrain the
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
supply of Housing and
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
well we do also have other bills
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
coming through the legislature that will
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
help increase the supply of housing so I
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
think if we pass those as well and this
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill then the um any negative effects
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
this might have on Supply will cancel
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
out and we'll just get the benefits of
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
it of helping protect tenants from
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
eviction and causing them to become
 
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.909 align:start position:0%
eviction and causing them to become
homeless

00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:48.710 align:start position:0%
homeless
um

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
another point
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
raised in opposition
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
to this legislation was that
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
it will harm landlords who are housing
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
providers and well let's get something
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
straight about this landlords are not
 
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:15.860 align:start position:0%
housing providers the people the workers
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
who built the housing are the people who
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
actually provided it not the landlords
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
the landlords just sit on housing and
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
charge people rent to live in it they
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
deny people housing by default rather
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
than providing it to them so it would be
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
more accurate to call them housing
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
deniers than housing providers
 
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.149 align:start position:0%
deniers than housing providers
so

00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:42.649 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
so basically housing is a human right we
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
need to start treating as such rather
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
than as a profit making opportunity for
 
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.730 align:start position:0%
than as a profit making opportunity for
landlords

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:54.740 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
so let's enable let's stand up for
 
00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.029 align:start position:0%
so let's enable let's stand up for
tenants

00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
well it's enable municipalities to stop
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
feudalism in New Hampshire and please
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
join me in voting against the itl motion
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 95 so that another motion
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
may be made
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
the house recognizes a member from
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
Barrington representative Lynn surcott
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the committee
 
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.769 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of the committee
report

00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here to recommend the motion of itl
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
by the overwhelming majority of our
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government
 
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.450 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government
committee

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
HP 95 attempts to impose a rent control
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
by allowing towns and City politicians
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
to develop ways to regulate their rents
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
this would result in nothing more than a
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
patchwork of regulations throughout the
 
00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.090 align:start position:0%
patchwork of regulations throughout the
state

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:49.100 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
manipulating the marketplace by those
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
least qualified to do so just does not
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
work and it makes matters work worse by
 
00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
distorting the free market
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunately like many other issues
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
that we encounter we look for the
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
instant gratification without
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
considering the long-term impact of
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
short-sighted ideas
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
now we have thousands of landlords in
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that provide many
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
thousands of rental units
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
landlords are not the problem and in
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
fact I'm pretty sure throughout this
 
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
entire body there are many landlords in
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
here or who have been landlords
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
yet in testimony testimony we heard
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
comments such as fraud is being
 
00:31:30.419 --> 00:31:31.669 align:start position:0%
comments such as fraud is being
committed

00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
committed
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
landlord commit landlords commit crimes
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
on society
 
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
landlords hoard housing lands landlords
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
are predatory
 
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
and even landlords are immoral
 
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
the comments insinuate that somehow the
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of landlords are colluding and
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
that is simply impossible when you have
 
00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
so many landlords in our states
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
the other comment I'd like to make is
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
that it it was made during testimony was
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
it's up to the legislature to fix and no
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
it is not legislators cannot fix supply
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
and demand issues overnight
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
on issues that have taken decades and
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
there are a few States
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
and these will sound familiar to some of
 
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.389 align:start position:0%
and these will sound familiar to some of
you

00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:27.889 align:start position:0%
you
California

00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
California
 
00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:30.539 align:start position:0%
New York New Jersey
 
00:32:30.539 --> 00:32:31.970 align:start position:0%
New York New Jersey
Delaware

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
Delaware
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
and Oregon recognize those States
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
those are the most fiscally
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
the states that are the most fiscal
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
basket cases in our country and they
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
also have the highest migration rates
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
out of there I also come to order
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
what was that about
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
remember making senior 37 States
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
actually have preemption laws against
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
now we heard much testimony from
 
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
landlords and Realtors actually who were
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
testifying on this and what would some
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
of the effects of actually rent control
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
be based on historical precedent
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
landlords will take units off the market
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
by converting their two three four unit
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
buildings back to single family or they
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
would just sell
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
Apartments will begin to deteriorate as
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
landlords no longer update or improve
 
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
their units for lack of funding
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
and apartment buildings or an apartment
 
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
buildings will cease they will investors
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
and landlords are not going to be
 
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.649 align:start position:0%
and landlords are not going to be
building

00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
on new uh new units
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
without being under the whims of the
 
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
local politicians
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
and as one of the Realtors said who
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
testify this law would have the opposite
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
effect of what is intended
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
constraining housing will reduce quality
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
and quantity
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
so I thought if this is a good idea
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
what's the next logical step if the idea
 
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
is to keep the price of rental units
 
00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:13.190 align:start position:0%
is to keep the price of rental units
down

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
do we next allow
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
to exercise control over the selling
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
the price of a building is Major
 
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:36.909 align:start position:0%
the price of a building is Major
contribute

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
looks like we had a mic there we go it's
 
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:41.629 align:start position:0%
looks like we had a mic there we go it's
Pat

00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
Pat
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
these are my popular boys
 
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.250 align:start position:0%
these are my popular boys
um

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean is is that the next next
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
logical step are we going to start
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
giving legislators and politicians the
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
ability to you know set prices on what
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
you and I can sell our houses for or our
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
buildings for
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
well we got to understand that these
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
markets are cyclical and driven by
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
supply and demand the higher prices of
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
today will be driven lower
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
not into the distant future
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen this some of you actually
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
weren't even born in the late 80s and
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
early 90s but I can tell you New
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire went through a massive crash
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the real estate market to the to the
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
point where over half of our banks in
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
this state went out of business because
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
it the prices crashed so so badly and
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
again 2008 not to the level of the late
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
80s and 90s but 2008 we saw the same
 
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.950 align:start position:0%
80s and 90s but 2008 we saw the same
thing

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
Wise Guys
 
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.270 align:start position:0%
Wise Guys
um

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
this is an instant gratification issue
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
we cannot simply fix the market forces
 
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
and supply and demand it has to run its
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
course this and other housing issues is
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
not something we can fix overnight it's
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
going to take decades to fix or at least
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
a long time because it's taken decades
 
00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
to occur prices do not only go up they
 
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
go down and they will
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
those buying inflated prices by the way
 
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:17.579 align:start position:0%
back in the 80s in the 2008 time frame
 
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
sustained foreclosures they lost things
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
so the cyclical Nation nature will bring
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
it back politicians bureaucrats not the
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
ones to alleviate these housing problems
 
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
those in the rental and business
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
building business are the ones who have
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
eventually solved the issue
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
landlords provide thousands and
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
thousands of units in this state
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
and lastly rent control is a historical
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
failure no matter where it's been tried
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
and it's not how we in New Hampshire do
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
business thank you Mr Speaker and I do
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%

00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:47.099 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
if I know a third of the state residents
 
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
are renters that are facing a rental
 
00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:57.740 align:start position:0%
market with vacancy rates of less than
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
0.11 percent
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
and their rental rates have increased in
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
the last three years more than 70
 
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.849 align:start position:0%
the last three years more than 70
percent

00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
if I know that hundreds of elderly and
 
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:13.820 align:start position:0%
disabled people
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
veterans and families are being
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
displaced from their homes because of
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
the escalating Reds
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
and if I know that HB 95 is enabling
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislation not a mandate which allows
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
local control
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the decision
 
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button so that
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
we can allow municipalities
 
00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:47.099 align:start position:0%
to deal with this emergency as soon as
 
00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:48.470 align:start position:0%
to deal with this emergency as soon as
possible

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
the questions on the majority committee
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
report of an expedient to legislate
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn turcott is
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
recognized for parliamentary inquiry
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that rent
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
control has been a failure wherever it's
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
been implemented and if I also know that
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
rents are a function of Supply demand
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
and not a case of hoarding fraud
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
immorality conspiracy or crimes of
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
society by landlords and finally Mr
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that passing this bill
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
will have the opposite effect of its
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
intentions and cause thousands of New
 
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire landlords that provide
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
thousands of rental units to reconsider
 
00:40:25.859 --> 00:40:26.750 align:start position:0%
thousands of rental units to reconsider
whether

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
to to consider whether to remove rental
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
units from the market would I then press
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
with everything she said someone who
 
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
walked 3 200 miles to try and get people
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
to focus on an issue of campaign Finance
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
reform that is exactly the type of
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
Citizen that we should be honoring in
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
this body
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
someone who stands up and tries to get
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
people involved a citizen who does
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
everything that they can in their power
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
to try and get the nation in which she
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
lives to focus on the values which it
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
purports to hold that to me is
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
the American dream it's being an
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
American citizen it's the beauty of
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
having the freedom that is owed to us as
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
an American and honoring granny D her
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
113 year old woman who lived from 1910
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
to 2010 by saying this is a woman who we
 
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
should live up to I think is exactly
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
what this house should be doing so thank
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker for allowing me to speak
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
I apologize I couldn't read too well off
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
of my phone but let's honor granny D
 
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
let's honor Doris by saying that we
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
making January January 4th uh her day I
 
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
think that's a worthwhile thing for this
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
the member from Durham representative
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
Horrigan is recognized to speak against
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
the committee report thank you very much
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I can skip most of my speech
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
because uh representative the
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative from Peterborough covered
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
the same ground um I
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
I was one of the people who actually
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
actually knew her I think she's probably
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
the greatest person I've ever met in my
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
life and I speak as somebody who's met
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
Jimmy Carter and Joey Ramone and a few
 
00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
other notable people over the years
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not nobody special I'm just old and
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
and um in fact people believe in ghosts
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
occasionally think sometimes you can
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
even see her ghost up in the up in the
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
gallery unfortunately I don't see it now
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
do you still alive in my memories I was
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
one of the several members of people
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
here in the room who attended her 100th
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
birthday party it was just around the
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
corner in the executive Council chamber
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
100 years is it's a lot more years than
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
most people get but it's still a pretty
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
short time and she made the most of it
 
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
and we heard just a sampling of the many
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
incredible things she did in those
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
hundred years
 
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
um she was 10 years old in 1920 when
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
women got the right to vote and she made
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
a point of asking a 10 year old girl to
 
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
introduce her 13 years ago right around
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
the corner from here in the executive
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
Council chamber and I don't remember the
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
exact date but it was in February
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
almost exactly almost exactly to the day
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
and it was actually at the same time of
 
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
day that we're now here about uh 11 A.M
 
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.069 align:start position:0%
day that we're now here about uh 11 A.M
so

00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
she was reminding us to pass was not
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
that long ago the future is already here
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
and the fight for justice never ends and
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
she deserves to be commemorated with the
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
day every year and so I think I think
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
she deserves to be singled out as one of
 
00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:34.700 align:start position:0%
the causes that we celebrate every year
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not the governor
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
chooses the issue a proclamation not as
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
every Governor I will have to admit who
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
served since she passed has done so so I
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
I receive me to overturn the itl so we
 
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
can move on to a another motion so thank
 
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.270 align:start position:0%
can move on to a another motion so thank
you

00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
the member from representative grotta is
 
00:54:59.930 --> 00:54:59.940 align:start position:0%

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:02.450 align:start position:0%

passion with us about granny d
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
magnificent person and contributed in
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%

representative hole moves that we
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
indefinitely postpone House Bill 422 are
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%

01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
right so we have a lot of new peoples

who explain the motion
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
and definitely postpone in a nutshell
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
means if that passes
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%

definitely postpone that that's it
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to indefinitely

on the house Select Committee for

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
broad bipartisan agreement to ensure
 
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
that we try to save as many housing
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%

year and if I know that I want to honor
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
that commitment would I then ask the
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
house to oppose the indefinite
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%

government committee by a vote of 1901
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
and if I forward further know that it is
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
a clear unfunded mandate
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%

me I am the representative Wendy Thomas
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
and I come before you to share my thanks
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
to some people in this room who helped
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
me through a pretty rough last two years
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
I look a little different from the last
 
01:11:00.649 --> 01:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
time some of you have seen me there are
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
reasons for that
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
in November of 2020 I got a virus that
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
left me with ongoing symptoms I couldn't
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
smell or taste food for about two years
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
I also had no appetite or sense of
 
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.570 align:start position:0%
I also had no appetite or sense of
thirst

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
thirst
 
01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:17.219 align:start position:0%
I lost a lot of weight
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
I wrote about my experiences and some of
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
my friends former and current
 
01:11:24.169 --> 01:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
legislators senators and even some staff
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
who knew me when I had been a rep
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
reached out and followed along
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
although the condition left me in
 
01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:34.739 align:start position:0%
precarious health I was grateful that I
 
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
wasn't as bad as some other people in
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
the same position
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
as sick as I was I was able to see the
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
humorous side
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
I sure was a lot of fun at holiday
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
parties when everyone played the game
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
give Wendy the candle and let her tell
 
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
us what it smells like
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
I couldn't identify one
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
I was sick but I was coping
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
but then last year in May on May 19th I
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with cancer
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
I started documenting my journey in a
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
private group and let my trusted friends
 
01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:07.699 align:start position:0%
some of whom are sitting in this Hall
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
into that private Circle
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
if you know me you know that I didn't
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
hold anything back
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
they heard the Bad and the Ugly
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
there is very little good to report
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
about cancer
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
they heard my fears and my outrage at
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
how unfair it all was
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
they heard me struggle to try to make
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
sense of anything
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
oh boy
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
at the beginning I was so cocky I was
 
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
ready to eat the right food and do the
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
right exercises I was going to beat this
 
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
cancer I was going to teach people how
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
to do cancer right
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
but here's a little life secret no one
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
can do cancer alone no one it is simply
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
too big
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
some people would have left me it's too
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
painful to watch it's too much it's too
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
scary but these friends my legislative
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
friends who had met me years before here
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
at the State House continued being my
 
01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.470 align:start position:0%
at the State House continued being my
friends

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
friends
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
they stayed with me the entire time
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
I had one horrific operation followed by
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
horrific pain followed by horrific
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
complications followed by another
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
horrific surgery followed by more
 
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
horrific pain all of this on top of the
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
constant Terror and threat of living and
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
maybe even dying with cancer
 
01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
I stumbled I fell
 
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
I dissolved into a wet heap of tissue
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
and Bone again and again
 
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
and each time from my friends my
 
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
legislative friends and you know who you
 
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:39.950 align:start position:0%
legislative friends and you know who you
are

01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
I heard we are here for you
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
borrow our strength until you can find
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
your own again
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
and you are loved
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
each time I fell I honestly didn't think
 
01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
I'd be able to get back up again
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
it was asking too much of me
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
I am just one little person yes I am
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
mighty but some things are mightier
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
but like a mother's prayer I kept
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
hearing from my friends we are here for
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
you borrow our strength until you can
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
find your own again and you are loved I
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
took Grace from their presence
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
and just like they offered I borrowed
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
from their strength until I could stand
 
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
on my own again
 
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
and I knew deep in my bones that I was
 
01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.830 align:start position:0%
and I knew deep in my bones that I was
loved

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
loved
 
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
because of my friends I was able to get
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
back up again and again
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm doing okay not completely out of the
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
woods yet but I'm doing okay
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
it is not hyperbole to say that some
 
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
members of this body Lifted Me and
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
helped to save both me and my family
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
to those members I am eternally grateful
 
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
so to wrap this up
 
01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
to the new legislators
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%

part that building Community is very
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
influenced by none other than our
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
neighbor who grew up in or was from
 
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts henrid Henry David Thoreau
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
his Civil Disobedience was what
 
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
influenced Gandhi and he followed him
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
very closely and when he was fight
 
01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%

01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
through Civil Disobedience and
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
