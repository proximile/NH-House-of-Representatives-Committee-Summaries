thank
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
you okay um first item of the agenda uh
 
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
Charlie and I did go to the the
 
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
meeting we were we were 66 on the on the
 
00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.110 align:start position:0%
meeting we were we were 66 on the on the
Hit

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
Hit
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
Parade so I I spent a lot of time in the
 
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
Carter catching up a lot of people so it
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
was kind of a fun day for me but um
 
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.550 align:start position:0%
was kind of a fun day for me but um
turns

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
turns
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
out they really we were on the agenda we
 
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
should really technically have been on
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
consent calendar I guess uh but they had
 
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
no questions about the Spectrum proposal
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
they just wanted to ask Charlie about
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
how's how's March Madness going
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh you know how's Powerball
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
going I mean basically that's what it
 
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
amounted to but no problem getting this
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
through the executive Council so what
 
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
what Charlie and I going to do is
 
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
sometime the week this week or maybe
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
next is but make contact with who the
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
actual consultant is and hopefully we
 
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
can have him either physically here or
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
um or do another Zoom with the
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
consultant that we're going to be
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
working with so that'll be next meeting
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that the date of that
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
next you know later in the meeting so
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the so no Pro
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
everything's approved contract signed
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
everything contract signed right yeah
 
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I signed it yeah okay you sign it
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
before you submitted
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not sure the process so um but
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
anyway so that that all went fine
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that Charlie
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
forward the second General item third
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
General item is the
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
survey I Charlie did send us all the um
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
results of the survey was pretty thick
 
00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
honest okay to be honest with you I
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
didn't I was busy doing some other
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
summaries of some of the other data we
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
had picked up um I didn't really go
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
through detail
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
myself um but from what I can see it's a
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
lot of data but really there's really no
 
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
there's really no conclusion I guess
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
maybe Charlie you can just help us out a
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
little bit with that yeah I mean I think
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
the report speaks for itself and
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
certainly you folks can read the
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
findings and results I think one of the
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
takeaways was that the Charities weren't
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
particularly happy with rent but since
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
we you know the legislature appears to
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
be addressing that that's not an issue
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
at least won't be an issue soon um
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
but if we want to do another study on
 
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
it's 147 Pages 22 pages of findings and
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
then the the remainder is the sort of
 
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
the raw data and the questions answered
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
and the some of the questions were
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
open-ended in terms of a response was
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
not a click button it was a please fill
 
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
in the blank here and so all those
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
responses are in the data it's 147 pages
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
I pray no one hit print um and if you
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
did I apologize and I can send you some
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
paper and some ink um but if you want to
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
read it over obviously it wasn't sent
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
out till last week so if you want to
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
read it over and we can discuss to the
 
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
next meeting that would make more sense
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
or if you want to have the researcher
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
come in and testify about it and their
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
findings or recommendations we can do
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
that too it's open to the
 
00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
membership well did
 
00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.189 align:start position:0%
membership well did
it

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think um that makes sense to
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
uh hold this over until the next meeting
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
and have chance to look at it I did uh
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
read through
 
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
it the first part rapidly um but uh yeah
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
there a few thing I think there were a
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
few things in there that
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
mer um at least attention yeah
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
yeah represent yeah I thought that you
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
know the was great I kind of glance
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
through the whole thing uh nothing that
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
I did not expect being a charity you if
 
00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
you want that they're very very similar
 
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
all the way through but I think that one
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the things it gives us is assumptions
 
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
versus reality and at least the two are
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
seem to be coming together but it's it's
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
great to be able to uh to have survey to
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
get as many Charities as did respond so
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
that I think it was about 75% something
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
like that here yeah I mean fundamentally
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
with any research study when n equals
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
more than 400 it's a valid survey it's
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
accur within a couple 3% so this wasn't
 
00:08:59.069 --> 00:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
a question of my fear is you know two or
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
three is come in here and they're
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
handpicked per I'm not saying that they
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
are but you you never wonder you wonder
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
and this would being hundreds and
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds this is all of the
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
Charities almost so statistically
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
valid okay that's really good any other
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
this so regarding the rent the the rent
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
which seemed you said was a top uh the
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
Senate we already voted on it um I I
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
FastTrack it in the Senate um so it's
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
been voted out of committee it's been
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
voted on the senate floor and I've asked
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
to be fast tracked to the governor's
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
office because as a 60-day delay in
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
implementation my goal was to have it
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
start July 1 and get it to the
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
governor's office get it signed so the
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
60-day starts right away starts within
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the 60 days so on a calendar cycle so
 
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure where it is in the fast
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
track um like I said I we we already
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
voted on it um two weeks
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
ago I look it up um but I FasTrack that
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
of the Senate I got the Senate President
 
00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
to sign it and send it over to the uh
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
back to the speaker because it was a
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
house bill and then the speaker's office
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
has to Fast Track it I've asked for it I
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly where it is in the
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
process yet so is it I'll say it again
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
is it is it effective the effective date
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
ju no the effective date is 60 days
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
after passage so if I can get it to the
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
governor by May 1 and he signs it on May
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
1st then 60 days later is July 1 right
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
and we're in good shape so that's what
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make happen is get it so
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
that it gets to him so he can have it
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
before May 1 and be able to sign off on
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
it so the 60-day cycle will start I'm
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
trying to get to do it on the beginning
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
of a month rather than the middle of the
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
cycle okay anything else on this no
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh next item um I'd ask for recent
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
data uh these two documents one is one
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
is February 2 of
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
23 and the other one is February of
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
24 then what I did what I did and it's
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
also in front of
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
you is I summarized it into one one
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
sheet paper if you want to
 
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.949 align:start position:0%
sheet paper if you want to
look

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
okay um and then I at the on the bottom
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
sheet I uh I compare it to the Baseline
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
I'm considering the Baseline for our
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
discussions count year
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
22 so if you if you can look at this
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
sheet okay it uh on we have the 23 data
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
and then we have the 24 data and was
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
broken down as far as it included poker
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
poker tournaments so poker tournaments
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
games of chance historic racing and then
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
total and then
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
allocations to facilities charities in
 
00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.069 align:start position:0%
allocations to facilities charities in
the

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
state and you could and then with the
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
same same columns for February 24 so
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
we're comparing February to February
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're comparing a February
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
to a leap year February so there was one
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
more day in 24
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
but you can see that the significant
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
jump that's occurred in the revenues uh
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
between one year and the
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
next uh and you know total total revenue
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
including facilities charities in the
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
state what one uh
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
increased seven almost 8
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
million uh over that
 
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.910 align:start position:0%
million uh over that
period

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
obviously the the the big jump was in uh
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
actually the big jump was
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
facilities were up four 5.5
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
million or
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
84.7% the Charities were up $1.1 million
 
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.389 align:start position:0%
84.7% the Charities were up $1.1 million
or

00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
58.8% and the state was up
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
$1.67 million or up
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
83.3% and that's the effect of historic
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
racing bullet kicking in well not
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
falling it's only in nine or 10
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
facilities right now not every facility
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
has has it in
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
place um and again this is this is the
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
this is the issue that we're going to be
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
addressing through the consultant of
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
what are the splits are are good or not
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh but everybody gained facilities
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
gained Charities gained State
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
gained uh the state was really getting
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
minimal from the games of chance they're
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
getting a lot more out of
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
the from uh historic racing which is
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
probably okay from the cost of
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
oversight uh but again the only number
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to be checking out I mean
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
the big number we're going to be
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
checking out is is the allocation of
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
between facilities and the Charities if
 
00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:49.749 align:start position:0%
between facilities and the Charities if
you

00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:49.759 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
will so when you go down to the bottom
 
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.670 align:start position:0%
will so when you go down to the bottom
of

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
this um I took if you remember the Green
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
Sheet we handed out
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
this this was a while ago and I compared
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
22 to fiscal year 23 then uh and then
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
uh from July 22nd to June 23rd and then
 
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519 align:start position:0%
and then calendar year 23 January to
 
00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:20.110 align:start position:0%
and then calendar year 23 January to
December

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
December
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
23 so what I did is I took as the base
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
year that first calendar the calendar
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
year J you know
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
22 so
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
and we can see given from the base
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
here of uh where the
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
split Revenue split was 60.5% of
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
facilities 27.9% of Charities and
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
11.6% to to the
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
state and then I annualized the February
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
number of 23 so I took the numbers
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
divided by 28 time 365
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
probably sees an alley in here somewhere
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
for some facilities just to give us a
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
sense so that showed if we annualize
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
February as to what what 24 is going to
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
look like you know we're we're from the
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
baseline from the base here of 22 we're
 
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.710 align:start position:0%
baseline from the base here of 22 we're
up

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
78.1% total revenues and if we if I took
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
February and annualized
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
it it really increases by uh from the
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
base year $ 53
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
million so or
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
208% so everything's
 
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
208% so everything's
growing

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
okay uh and again for the annualized
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
number you you could see that the
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
facilities went up 60 60.5 base share
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
went to
 
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
66.5% then
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
68.5 Charities went from
 
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.990 align:start position:0%
68.5 Charities went from
27.9%

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
27.9%
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
19.4% and 17. 2% in the state went
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
percentage wise went up uh from from
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
11.6% to 14.1% to
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
14.3% so again it's just informational
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
for us just see things are growing we
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
could see that uh from the numbers of
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
more more the reason for us to make sure
 
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
the oversight's correct and that the
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
allocations are are correct uh because
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
where we we got the tiger by the tail
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
here so yes Senator hey Charlie can I
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
get four more data points on 23 and 24
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
February sheet can I get on the on the
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
games of chance I'm interested in the
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
number of facilities that were active at
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
that same so we're comparing Apples to
 
00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:49.959 align:start position:0%
Apples we know how many facilities if we
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
had more facilities it's going to change
 
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
the the metric what we're looking at and
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
on the HHR remue the number of
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
machines because I again I well we're
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
looking at percentage of gross overall
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
handle I'm guessing is what we're
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
looking at here we also have to
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
recognize that like when you do your 22
 
00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
23 24 they went from 20 M Charities went
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
from $20 million $39 million a your
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
doubling of Revenue um going to
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
Charities even though the percentages
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
might have adjusted the Charities also
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh did did significantly well as so just
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
just making sure we're talking about the
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
percentages while we're talking about
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
gross handle number of facilities number
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
of machines as well as um you know
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing that we're not talking about
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
a percentage of of Revenue
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
year-over-year we're talking about the
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
percent the percentage of the gross
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
handle that's all I'd actually suggest
 
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
we add a couple more metrics to like
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
sort of the average per machine average
 
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
per facility right well that's I fig
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
that out once I know what those other
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
numbers are yeah yeah yeah
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
no but just so we understand because we
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
know that um we know that uh back in 22
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't have very many operators that
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
were running HHR at all right and so
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
trying to correlate 22 to 24 when we
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
have 1800 machines compared to we might
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
have had a few hundred machines in 22
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that's important to understand what
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
that metric looks like and we're going
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
to have another large facility come
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
online in less than a year um which will
 
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
increase the number um by 60% right so
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
just again just trying to make sure
 
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:22.039 align:start position:0%
we're looking we all have the same
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
picture and again how how the growth of
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
the industry is happen is important us
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
understand how the revenue growth is
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
also happening so
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
so with that statement though Charlie um
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
home for have been approve approved yet
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
right no additional facilities have been
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
approved have
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
they no additional facilities have been
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
approved correct but some are in the
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
process of building new facilities
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
within their movable jurisdiction so
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
that one one equals one just one's going
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
from X to so you mean the facility 12x
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the facility Nation yes
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah okay that's moving to a new
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
building so we have the issue of again I
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
think when we started this we started
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
this last year in 23 there was seven
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
seven rooms that had HHR now I think
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
we're up to 10 there still four more
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
that potentially could get HHR that are
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
under current law correct yeah correct
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
so there's still room in there and then
 
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
there's the ones that are in the
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
pipeline and the ones that are in the
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
pipeline based on 472 and some of the
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
other pills yes may be approved which
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
may be approved certainly you know the I
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
keep getting calls I'm like it's still
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
the L still exists it's it it is in law
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
now whether it's new law is a different
 
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.789 align:start position:0%
now whether it's new law is a different
question

00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right um oh
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes just a question are are is our
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
consultant going to help us look ahead
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
and think about where this these HHR
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
revenues might be headed um you know
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's all guesstimation I guess but uh
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
but uh we're we're in a you know
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
sharp uh slope going up um at some point
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to level off and maybe even
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
competition from around will uh uh even
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
change the trend from from the plateau
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
that's reached to start with so are we
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at the yeah I think
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think we got to we got to discuss one
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the ways one of the things we got to
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
look at is we we you you were in the
 
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
middle of all this when we did the uh
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
regular Casino
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
bills what's the saturation point in
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
terms of the number of
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
machines and I think we'd be asking the
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
consultant to work to give us a sense
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
given the population here and the and
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
the market maybe in Mass you know
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
Northern mass and the Western
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
Maine a little bit of Vermont but you
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
know what is the saturation Point uh and
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
do we want to put a limit on the number
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
of machines total you know now you could
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
say let's we could have the marketplace
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
to that too eventually they're G you
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
know someone's going to say well it's
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
not worth it because we have so many of
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
these machines
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
around right now it seems like the
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
dollar per machine has been pretty
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
good um in terms of exceeding our
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
original thoughts as to what they they
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
would produce but El I think we need to
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
have some guidance as
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
to as we further discuss and I mean I
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
know the legislature is putting the
 
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
seveny year moratorium is that correct
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
Senator that's the bill that's currently
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
in front of ways and means in the house
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
side Senate passed a seven-year
 
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
moratorium with the incremental growth
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
of the industry for the people that are
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
already in the pipeline John do you have
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
anything to add there it's it's over
 
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
your place the the moratorium the
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
seven-year addition is that have you
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
guys taken that up or
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay we had a public hearing on it but
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't uh done anything further yeah
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
I will say there was interest and as
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
soon as the house finishes it expedite
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
that bill as well because of the fact
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at a j June 30th date
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
on a moratorium I most likely we'll take
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
those that and and other bills up a week
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
from tomorrow most like it's not in the
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
calendar yet but that's the thought
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I have another question yeah sure
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
it's sort of the context we're working
 
00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:36.919 align:start position:0%
in that's my question about where we're
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
headed to in revenue is prob these games
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we have in front of us um another
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
activity that may be outside our
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
frame but um it's certainly happening
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
and that is sports
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
betting and there's uh that that like
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing seems to be
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
taking off Charlie you can tell me that
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
that's not so but that's my impression
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
anyway so you you think there's a link
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
between sports betting and store horse
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
racing the there's a drop off with the
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
growth of store horse racing I certain
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
no not necessarily both are grow yeah
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
both are grow yeah so sports betting is
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
still growing the number of users is
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
still growing F folks who actually use
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
and bet on Sports is increasing in the
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
state what we did lose is we lost a
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
small but very enthusiastic number of
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
VIPs at retail uh we had a few that
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
would average you know 10 20
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
$330,000 a weekend in sports betting um
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
it's just what they like to do they're
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
quite wealthy just what they like to do
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and so those folks are going in
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
Boston now because it's closer to home
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
and we're also lost a smaller number but
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
still significant number of folks who
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
would drive up here to use their phone
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
to bet you know the portsman traffic
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
circle and the mall at Nashville real
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
popular um for folks from M to drive up
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
so we've lost those two but by and large
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's been they've both been successful
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the number two
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in the country for state
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
revenue in sports betting out of 38 n
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
something like that so New York's one
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're two so yeah but and restor will
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
continue to grow um there are a number
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
of facilities coming as you know the
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
we're not to the maximum number yet and
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
that will I think we'll meet I think
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
we'll hit Market saturation before we
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
have the maximum number of facilities
 
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.950 align:start position:0%
have the maximum number of facilities
online

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
um so I I think it would it would be
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
have let me back up one one of the
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
aspects of sport bet sports betting is
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh the uh physical location the sports
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
book you call them um places and I know
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
the brook is one I don't know what else
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh where where they are but I think it
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to have that picture at
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
least beside alongside of what we're
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
looking at here so that we've got a a
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
more complete picture of betting that's
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
going on and casino activity after all
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
the brook is a casino and within that
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
casino is sports betting book and um you
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
know if you go in there it's all seem
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's all in a well they partitions but
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
it's all in the same
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
room uh without a doubt and people slide
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
from this to that sure yeah that's a
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
10 so just two things so Charlie if I
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
remember right we're not even at we only
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
allowed 10 game 10 retail locations and
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
I think we only have four or five I'm
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
not sure which four four we've only
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
reached four so far to the 10 that are
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
possible um and then as a percentage of
 
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue the retail Market is pretty
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
insignificant compared to the online
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
Market it's material not significant
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's um terms of our handle it's
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
probably % give or take given them and
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
so terms of profitability it's much
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
lower than that um and but it is an
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
environment I mean if you've been to the
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
brook you know it's a it's like a a
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
sports bar you can actually bet on stuff
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
at it's sort of the mentality similarity
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
to Manchester as well it's a environment
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
some folks just like to be in a physical
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
environment some folks want to do it on
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
a phone I I just making sure we
 
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
understand Revenue pie it's only we're
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
only at 40% of possible we the bill that
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh that we past 418 um only has 10 10
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
possible locations so even if we have 20
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
casinos at the end of this when we're
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
all done only 10 of them can have sports
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
recil sports books correct and
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
fundamentally I think we're going to
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
have to look and even internally and I
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
know you and I have spoken on it about
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
Shifting the the the revenue share model
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
to make it profitable for facilities to
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
do it because there it's one of the
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
limiting factors um say is is there
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
certain rest of these facilities right
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
pardon they have sports
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
oh yeah downside it's also one of the
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
reasons why only charlot beging
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
facilities have launched them is because
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
they have so many of these operations
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
already in place you know the financial
 
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
reporting the anti-money laundering the
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
the kyc all all the sort of responsible
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
gambling practices surveillance money
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
count that there's already so many of
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
these activities in place that a new
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
facility would have hard time doing it
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
because they don't have all obviously
 
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
the other side the charitable ging
 
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.389 align:start position:0%
the other side the charitable ging
facilities

00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
to okay
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think one of thing that's
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
important is when we're looking at the
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
saturation and uh the monitori is
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
basically giving those operators a
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
chance again if you want to kind of see
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
what their what their base is if you
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
want a revenue and that we can see that
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
they're adding amenities if you want to
 
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
the um to the gaming rooms and that uh
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
if you have too many then you go over
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
and you start cutting down the um
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
yeah the vibe if you want okay in a in a
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
particular room if you want that it's
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
it's it's much nicer if you want or more
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic for a player to go in
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
especially new ones if it's a u if it's
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
the the Parker U the rooms again if you
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
want or the uh um roulette Etc here if
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
you've got 15 players around again here
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
we're betting on the item versus two so
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
that uh that's where I think the moror
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
the oratorium is going to kind of help
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
you can try to find out exactly where it
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
is one question on the two items that
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
you that you put out the two
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
reports the can you tell me the again on
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
the February
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
2024 on the orange bottom I see tied to
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
your comparison of uh
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
poker report that that you made uh Mr
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.070 align:start position:0%
is up on top that's tournament
tournament

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
tournament
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
tournament yeah that's tournament that's
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
tournament this difference between
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
tournament poker and ra cash
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
poker so the the cash cash poke help me

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
cash poker is part of the uh uh games of
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
chance Revenue cash poker gam okay then
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
this tournament poker okay it's in there
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not shown as a separate
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
number any on any other report because
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's buried in with it's part of part of
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
part of g a chance uh correct me
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
this cash poker is part of games chance
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
revenue and then but po poker tournament
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
not every not every facility has does
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
tournaments um is is calculate
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
separately there
 
00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
um for a reason because the money sep
 
00:30:31.159 --> 00:30:32.830 align:start position:0%
um for a reason because the money sep
treated

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
treated
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
separately okay yes uh I just wanted to
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
go back quickly to director McIntyre's
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
statement about New Hampshire's numbers
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
two in sports betting is that per capita
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
or total um per capita okay per capita
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
so uh last year we made $38 million uh
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
in profitability from sports betting
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
which is essentially quadruple what we
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated when I first did the fiscal
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
note all right so I like being wrong
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
that way yeah I I'm sure you folks do
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
you okay any other comments on this
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
particular item no okay thank
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
you uh next one uh again there's a lot
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
of issues I'm just trying to tick off
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
here uh license transfer
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
status now we
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
did uh on your desk is
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
also piece of paper here
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
where it basically indicates the statute
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
for HHR related to
 
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
transfer RSA 284
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
22b section two reads an application
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
that is approved by Lottery Commission
 
00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
and a license that is granted shall not
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
be permitted to be transferred or
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
sold and for the under the games of
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
chance statutes RSA 287d colon 4 Roman 3
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
reads no license shall be
 
00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:04.310 align:start position:0%
reads no license shall be
transferable

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
transferable
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
so I gu is pretty clear that license
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
cannot be
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
transferred but businesses can be
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
transferred correct that's correct so
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
business can be
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
sold but they but the business before
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
that transaction would probably have to
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
apply for a license before that that's
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
correct so so it's want to make sure
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
everybody aware of that that's why I'm
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
bringing it up
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
so we have a situation in conquer as we
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
all know um there's they were given six
 
00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.310 align:start position:0%
all know um there's they were given six
months

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
to sell
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
it um sell the business sell the
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
business they licensed they'd have to
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
whoever that business is if they wanted
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
to remain a
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
casino charal gaming location as it say
 
00:32:56.909 --> 00:32:56.919 align:start position:0%
uh would have to get it a license
 
00:32:56.919 --> 00:33:00.110 align:start position:0%
uh would have to get it a license
approved

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
correct yep I think I'm following up on
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
something down the center of the table
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
from a couple meetings
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
ago no this is good um the
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the question that arises is whether
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh there is any limit on the numbers of
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
licenses that can be held by a
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
single owner um and um I believe that
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
right now there is none so right now um
 
00:33:36.629 --> 00:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
a uh a
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
company uh that starts out
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh early in the game and has a
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
license can uh look across the border
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
and uh to the next town and and by um
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
that company becomes a a subsidiary of
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
the first company
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
and um and now that company has two
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
licenses and so it could go across the
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
state we have no as far as I know
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
there's no limitation unless uh our
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
friend at the end of the table knows
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
about monopolies uh and some some
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
limitation there but I don't think so
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't have any ANC compressed
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a general
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
regarding no
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
monopolies yeah that's about the only
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
thing I can think of in terms of the
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's a specific constitutional the
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
state shall not pass laws which create
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
monopolies but we know of at least one
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
owner that has maybe four licenses
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's it's it's five but certainly Li
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know I view the issue as more of a
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
how much of the marketplace you control
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
um do you have one giant shopping mall
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
or do you have five small strip malls so
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the percentage of the
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
marketplace is No One controls a
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
majority of the market yet in terms of
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
then I I'd like to suggest that this
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
issue be on our on our list of issues to
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
to address and uh make sure whether or
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
not there should be a limit on the uh
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
Holdings of one company of the overall
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
number of licenses that are out there or
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
of so a question with regard to a
 
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
of so a question with regard to a
followup

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
followup
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
of what my colleague said uh it seems at
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
this point at this point in time we have
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
no regulation on the number of of
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
entities you the number of entities you
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
can have uh and if you look at the uh
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
television advertising that's that's
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
appearing it appears that that there's
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
one entity that has four licenses right
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's what it appears now the the
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
question the question that arises is is
 
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.150 align:start position:0%
question the question that arises is is
is

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
too what's the cost of a
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
license and if if the cost of a license
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
is so di Minimus I'd buy
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
10 what what what prevents anybody from
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
from doing that and then you you just uh
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
aggregate the number of Charities that
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
want something or want want to
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
participate and and you can put them in
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
any one of these these
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
locations it it it it seems to me that's
 
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
kind of the base issue that that we're
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
addressing a what is the cost of a
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
license and the number of licenses that
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
will be allocated ated and is there a
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
restriction on the number of licenses
 
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
that one entity uh can own we're talking
 
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.390 align:start position:0%
that one entity uh can own we're talking
about

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
transferability in in in in legislation
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
but that transferability I think is
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
governed by the decision that was made
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
in the case versus the cant situation
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
where where that that entity was given
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
permission to to sell that license or it
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
appears that way we just heard that's
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
not the case did I misunderstand
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
something are they're going to be
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell the license not the
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
license the business the business
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to sell the business sell
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
the business but is the license
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
business they they that it seems to me
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
that that that business has that
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
business has one value but that business
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
with the license has another
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
value it's the right to apply for storic
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
horse racing that business has it it's
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
the valuable thing not the license
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
itself there's not there's not a
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
transferable license there isn't a
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
license really it's just that that
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
business was operating gam a chance at a
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
certain time period
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
when you could as a business supply
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
versal course raising that's what the
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
value of the business is but certainly
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
um I I'm hesitant to speak further on it
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
true understand but that that's that's
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
overriding our our our decisionmaking
 
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
process here it it it seems me that's
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's something that's
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
hanging over this this group because the
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
decision's going to be made there
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's one one decision that came down
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
but the second decision what happens
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
after this this period of time you know
 
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
what what ha what has transpired during
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
that period of time and what effect does
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
that have going
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
forward thank you Mr CH
 
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
soor yeah no I'm actually f again I I
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
think the argu the discussion is whether
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
we limit the consolidation of licenses
 
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
within the state or not um there the big
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
big picture question um whether we
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
should do that what that means to the
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
free market and what class what whether
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
that consolidation results in Monopoly
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
and the determination of whether or not
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
a monopoly that's a pretty big question
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
right now that but it is definitely a
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
question but again we go back to we have
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
a limit currently in statute on the
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
number of gaming operations and the
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
number of historic for well not the
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
number of gaming operations but the
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
number of historic horse racing
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
operations we have unlimited gaming
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
operations are available right now per
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
statute but gaming uh horse historic
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
horse racing licenses are limited to 15
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
um the current lenses and if we pass 472
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
that number goes up to about 20 so I
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
think there's five in in the in the
 
00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
pipeline that POS that would be eligible
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
again doesn't mean they're going to get
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
them it just means that they're El they
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
would be classified as eligible for the
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
next seven years to be able to apply so
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
we know that there's a limit of on HHR
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
only we have a li of 20 possible
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
licenses assuming 472 passes for the
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
next seven years on the games of chance
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
side there's no restriction right so
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
just making sure we're all clear and
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand how what that what it looks
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
like as a
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
picture represent just just a follow up
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
on on a if a business buys a business
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
that has a license does that new
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
business have to get preapproved or yes
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
okay yeah they they would go through the
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
same vetting process unless it was an
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
already already approved business oh
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
right say one wants to make buy a second
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
one then they've already gone through
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
the process absent corporate changes if
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're still the same people the same
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
business doing the same things they
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
would be we would still approve them but
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
the process would be a lot easier I see
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman so this
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
business has already been sold and the
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
new new owners are operating it no no
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
there's been no change in the status of
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
the conquer facility so the bus business
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
has been sold but transferred yet nope
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
it hasn't not it's still in the status
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
it was in 6 months
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
ago for the most part okay so the the
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
sale of the business contingent about
 
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
them obtaining a license so no
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
connection they have the right to apply
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
for one but correct so they if if if if
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I'll say it's hypothetical and my
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer's next to me so I I'll speak
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
let's be careful representative um if a
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
business wants to purchase this they
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
could they would come to us they would
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
submit an application and then we would
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
review the application for their
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
suitability where that's where it says
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay and the application is for the
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
license and that moves the business
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
forward or not correct the application
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
is for the entire is for the business
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
itself and what form they want to take
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
that is an open question but certainly
 
00:41:57.079 --> 00:41:57.790 align:start position:0%
that is an open question but certainly
the

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
they would apply to us and it's
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetical now because I don't know if
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
if or when somebody would apply what
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
they would say or do or how they would
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
submit it because it's it's a
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
hypothetical thank
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
you yeah follow
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
up again so in the case of conquer
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's been no change the owner still
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
is the owner and as far as anybody knows
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's been no sale so nothing is
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
happening there right now but my the one
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
point I want to make is that if because
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
Charlie brought it up was if the makeup
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
of a corporation changes they that
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
change has to be go through the similar
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
process with lottery for Who's involved
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
and they have to go through their
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
background checks and everything else it
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
just understand that even in the makeup
 
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
of an existing operation if it changes
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
hands or changes percentage ownership in
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
the LLC that change has to go through
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
Charlie as well for approval process
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
that correct Charlie correct yep thank
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
you John I have your name next to this I
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's anything else
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
Dr 40 Chief compliance officer for the
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
new Hamp Lottery um I know you had put
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
put me on the agenda I think everything
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's been said is 100% accurate as
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang just said anytime there's a
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
change of ownership of 10 at 10% or more
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
we do a review of that um so if it's
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
even a minor transfer of a minority
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
ownership we would still vet that um vet
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
that transfer so um in terms of um
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
conquer as stated there's there's been
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
no change at this point in time um and
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
yep so everything else that you've
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
discussed is absolutely accurate in
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
transfers okay
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
so again the license is with the the the
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
current whoever the owners are now like
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
just do it one more time for me so if we
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
have a a partial change in
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
ownership how does that work yeah sure
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
so let's say you were a license holder
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
you had a business and you wanted to
 
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
sell a 20% stake in that business um you
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
would have to um submit that information
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the Lottery Commission to let them
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
know who the new 20% owner was um and
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
then we would do a suitability review on
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
the new 20% owner a suitability review
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
We review um the criminal background we
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh the gaming background the financial
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
background of the uh new company any uh
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
key employees for example uh if it's a
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
corporation we look at the officers we
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
look at board members um and so we would
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
do a review of that um we would come up
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
with a uh a factual report uh and a
 
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation which would go over to
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office the
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General then does their own
 
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
independent review um and we confer and
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
either decide whether that new group
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
would be suitable or not that is that
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
approval is necessary before that
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
transfer can go into effect so what I'm
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
hearing is that very much like a new guy
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
coming in exactly like a new guy coming
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
in so basically vetted the same way as
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing here it is so any
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
really any material
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
transfer essentially triggers uh a new
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
review as if it were a new application
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
um and I will say we we set the
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
automatic Threshold at 10% but for
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
example we need to be we need to told of
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
every transfer um and so for example if
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
we if we got a transfer 3% to Sam
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
bankman freed or something like that we
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
have authority to go look into any
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
transfer at any level um so the 10% is
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
just a default rule but we can certainly
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
look beyond that if there are concerns
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
or points of interest on those
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
transfers thank you Mr chairman why
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you look into any percentage at
 
00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
all oh somebody come no coming in like
 
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.309 align:start position:0%
all oh somebody come no coming in like
even

00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:05.559 align:start position:0%
1% we could um so for example often
 
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
times some of these companies have
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
passive investment groups uh behind them
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
um and so there might be changes in
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
passive investors who have nothing to do
 
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
with the actual operation so we might do
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
a a if uh if there is a uh 3 to 5%
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
change in a passive ownership group um
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
we would certainly review it to make
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we understood what was going
 
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
on but we might not it might not trigger
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
a full suitability review because that
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
group doesn't have any um any sway in
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
sort of the uh the overall funding of
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
the operation uh the day-to-day
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
operation of gaming um so it's not uh it
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be relevant um so
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
again 10% is just a a a rule um but if
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
we we look at everything that changes
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
and if even if it was a 2% change that
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
we thought was relevant to the operation
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
or we had concerns about the people
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
coming in we would look at that but
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
there are instances especially with
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
passive investment groups where it
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to uh to to use the
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
time and the resources uh to chase down
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
that small of a percentage change in
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
some in a company that doesn't really
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
have any um active involvement in the in
 
00:47:19.559 --> 00:47:22.030 align:start position:0%
have any um active involvement in the in
the

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
business and and just so the the
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee knows uh the Attorney
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
General's office can initiate a
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
suitability investigation at any time
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
and so what what happens at Lottery um
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
is the pretty standard normal process of
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
how things transferred or how new people
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
come in but if the Attorney General
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
deems it appropriate then uh our office
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
can go ahead and initiate an
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
investigation so as sponte uh the other
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
thing I I i' perhaps maybe ask U Mr coni
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about is is uh how
 
00:47:59.470 --> 00:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
transfers work publicly traded
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
companies sure so um there are there are
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
often changes in publicly traed
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
companies in terms of the stock moves uh
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
quite often um and so we review the
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
filings that come across the SEC uh the
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
the 10K filings that um occur um but
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
again I think what uh maybe Mr Del Forno
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
is going going to is public TR companies
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
literally change ownership every day so
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
um those it wouldn't be feasible to do a
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
review on on those uh but those are
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
obviously fractional changes on a on a
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis if there are management
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
changes in a publicly trigger company
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
that's when we would jump in and take a
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
look at new management new CEO new board
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
members um new uh key executive officers
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
um but to Mr Del far's point which it
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
would be is a very good one one I should
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
have latched on earlier um several of
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
our uh licens are publicly companies and
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
the the they change ownership as we
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
speak um so it wouldn't obviously be
 
00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:07.799 align:start position:0%
feasible to to identify all of those
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
changes so just focus on that a second
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
so how many publicly traded companies I
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
mean I mean I don't know if Delaware
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
North is or if uh Churchill Down is is
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
you know we have some big players in
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
now uh who who of them are Churchill
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
Downs is a publicly traded company
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
now I believe that might
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
be that might be the only one who's
 
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
currently um who's currently uh licensed
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
um we obviously deal with DraftKings
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
who's also a public ler company right
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
and um we have some other companies
 
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
who've um expressed interest who are
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
publicly traded but presently Churchill
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
Down's the only one who has a games en
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
traded any other question questions for
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
John see thank you very much
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah we we we as a group are going to
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
have to come to terms with I think some
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the issues that were brought up a few
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
minutes ago about the limits on the
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
licenses how many anyone organization I
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
want I want to bring this up again in a
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
few minutes when we start talking
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
because I did a pretty good look I do
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time looking at the
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
ranges of the sizes of these
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
organizations from from what the
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
Charities get perspective but this
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
really really is brings out loud that we
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
got a wide range of of owners here we
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
got a wide range of size of facilities
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about and that and uh
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
and that I think like was someone
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned that maybe it's not just the
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh number of licenses I think it's the
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars that are behind each
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
one of those licenses in terms of the
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
the size of the facilities that we're
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
talking about because some of them are
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
pretty tiny actually so um so anyway we
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll that's definitely on the
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
list of things to for us to
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
resolve uh one of the other issues that
 
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
was on the list and has been on is
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
breakage what we want to resolve I keep
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
on bringing this one
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
up uh uh I think we're getting close I
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
think we know that
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
the uh I guess there's two vendors that
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
Pro provide historic racing machines
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
that are not there's four total
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
Charlie's going away I need take a
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
phone uh okay can you help me I can
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
address any of those questions yeah okay
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
uh that uh two two are are paying into
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
the bucket for the breakage and the
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
other two just don't have it in their
 
00:51:55.559 --> 00:51:57.190 align:start position:0%
other two just don't have it in their
software

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
software
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
I think to summarize I think we as a as
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
a committee have agreed the very least
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
that we should have the the ones that
 
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
aren't contribute something to the pot
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
of uh chable of U um to uh problem
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
gaming and to give you an idea when you
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
24 and you go on the second
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
page uh br breakage for problem gaming
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
for February 24 was
 
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.829 align:start position:0%
for February 24 was
15,964

00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
15,964
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
20,800 so so we're right now we're we're
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
getting contributions of about 200,000
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
annually uh from the two vendors now
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the other two
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
vendors probably even bigger and that uh
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
what I was I is Charlie I know if we can
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
have done by today is to come up with a
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
number first we have as a committee we
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
have to agree how we want to handle us
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
but I think we're getting
 
00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.789 align:start position:0%
but I think we're getting
closer

00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
closer
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay yep okay Charlie has an emergency
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
has to deal with So Sorry Charlie see
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
you um John is Gonna Fill In firm what
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
so I guess we I I had asked Charlie can
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
we come up with a
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
number that would be
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
fair uh that we should charge the other
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
vendors an annual fee that may be
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
variable depending on how many machines
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
year I if you had this conversation with
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
him we did have this conversation so um
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
I I did look at this representative Ramy
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and we as you said uh you had the
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
numbers for February uh very similar
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
numbers for March uh we had about
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
$6,500 in
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
breakage um for March so it continues on
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
that trend of around 16,000 uh a month
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
um about 55% of the overall machines uh
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
create breakage in the state um 45 do
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
not and just to clarify this a little
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
bit there are four tote machines in
 
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.950 align:start position:0%
bit there are four tote machines in
operation

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
um three of them do contribute breakage
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's only one that does not that would
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
be um from uh answorth um does not um uh
 
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:41.559 align:start position:0%
does not create uh breakage off of their
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
tote machine again only one only one
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
correct but they are orig then I was
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
talking Char on the phone you said it's
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
was two no it's it's one uh they are one
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
of the larger uh there's really two
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
large tote companies and two very small
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
tote companies the two very tote small
 
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
tote companies do contribute breakage um
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
but they are at this point one of the
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
totes is only uh available in one room
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
is only 50 um terminals U operating off
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
of them so um it's a very very very
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
small percentage of the overall uh
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
Market um so if you wanted to get a
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
sense of the overall um sort of the
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
overall impact of not creating that that
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
that um the absence of that a breakage
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
from that one operator um it's it would
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
essentially we would think about double
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
the the the breakage if they were
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
operating on the same with the same math
 
00:55:41.069 --> 00:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
models that the others did um because
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
again they represent about 45% of the
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
market um so if we're expecting you know
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
again to be on that trend of about
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
$200,000 that would certainly be a a
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
give or take again within a tolerance of
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
5 to 10% that would be what we would
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
expect from break age if they were
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
running the same math model so I feel
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
more comfortable if we could take that
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
number the well this February number 15
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
whatever I would take a larger sample
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
than this one month but but then
 
00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:13.799 align:start position:0%
calculate that against the number of
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
machines or number or some some Metric
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
probably maybe
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
breakage by the machines that
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
are are creating this
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know for the problem Gaming
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
revenue U so that we could say okay
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's comparable and then then that'll
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
be a fee for the first year and then a
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
fee for the second year would have to be
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted based on that any any change in
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
that mix
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
of of uh of use if you
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
will sure sorry yes I can make a
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation as I've been looking at
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
this I think probably the easiest metric
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
that'll deal with growth growth is what
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
current breakage looks like as a
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
percentage of handle right and then use
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
that as a metric going forward and then
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
but I also don't want to force the
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
people that are currently praying
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
breakage to change their software to
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
have to now comply with the new law so I
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
think it's an either or it's either
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
should be a percentage of gross handle
 
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
as one or whatever the current law is
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
and and the operator can pick either one
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
to work from so that it's not
 
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
problematic We Don't Force One company
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
to either start creating a breakage
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
model the other one to have to abandon
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
their breakage model and have to
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
reprogram theirs so I think it should be
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
an either or and a percentage of handle
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
gross handle probably seems you can
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
probably look back historically and say
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
based on the handle what percentage are
 
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
we collecting in breakage and then use
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
that going forward that'll deal with
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
growth of the market as well we we can
 
00:57:46.109 --> 00:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely do that we have all that data
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
Senator um and so we can basically um
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
any way that you want to chop up the
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
data we can do that if you want to do
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
breakage as a percentage of of um handle
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
we certainly can provide the historic uh
 
00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:01.039 align:start position:0%
information on that I could just say
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
just to to to um put a finer point on it
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
from the lottery commission's
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
perspective we really would not like to
 
00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
force uh a software change uh because
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
that would require essentially going in
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
and um redoing the software on about a
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
thousand terminals uh around the state
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
and every time there's a software change
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
we have to allocate resources um both in
 
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
our office and in the field to make make
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
sure that that change is done
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately and has been tested and um
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
so it would be a massive undertaking uh
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
to uh force that software change I don't
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
think I don't think that's the direction
 
00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:40.039 align:start position:0%
we want to go in either uh we just want
 
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
to make it fair that the others are are
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
contributing something to to uh to
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
problem gaming you know breakage some
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
kind of an estimate of breakage if you
 
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:51.799 align:start position:0%
will uh proportional to the machines
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
that are calculating the
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
breakage as best we can absolutely we
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
can I think we can that's something you
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
can do between now and next meeting give
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
us a give us a sense well put me as the
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
so we got a problem a little problem we
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
want to fix it what what do we want to
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
do and I I think and we don't want to we
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
want to force the vendors to come up
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
with software changes that doesn't make
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
any sense and I I I think I agree with
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
Tim is is that it's either it's in
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
either War leave it up to the vendors
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
which way they want to do it if you if
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
they already have they already have the
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
software they could continue to do that
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
if they don't then we're going to we're
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
going to come up with a number we're
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
going to say every year you're going to
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
pay X and that's but proportional to
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
growth in certain things whatever the
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
metric is as we were talking about so uh
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
we we I don't think is it safe to say
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
that none of us want to force the sof
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
the vendors to to create software I
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody saying
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
yes but I'm not seeing anybody saying
 
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't charge the others to
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
come up with an equivalent number
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
because we really are not charging them
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
to even work here so this is going to be
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
kind of their dues if you would Mr chair
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
if I could add we have talked to xacta
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
which is the largest um tow company that
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
does create breakage um they can also
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
from what they've represented I can I
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
can reach out to them and double check
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
again that they can sort of turn that
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
off in favor of a a straight fee model
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know a pay payment of a of an RG fee
 
01:00:43.029 --> 01:00:43.039 align:start position:0%
on the front end um and either return
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
that breakage into the pool where it
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
could be won by the players that that is
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
not a software change for them that's
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
just a quick configuration so um again I
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken to the two smaller
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
vendors and what that might entail if we
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
decide to uh to to let everybody move
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
towards a just a a fee for uh fee to to
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
to participate in the market that would
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
go towards RG funding um I know that
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
xacta has the ability to do that with
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
very minimal um with a very minimal
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
impact okay so also my understanding is
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
that if that happened in all four
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
that'll be a there'd been writing checks
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
out of their out of whatever
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
resources um and that would that would
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
mean it'd be more an a poot for
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
Charities it it it would it would return
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
that that money into uh the pool which
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
would uh increase uh increase prices
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
would probably increase play um so it
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
could it could have a a positive impact
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
on eventually on state revenue and then
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
charity Revenue as well just want to
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
make sure we all understand that
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
repres yeah I think we're you you asked
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
for reactions to this it sounds good to
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
me but I'd like to see it and think yeah
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
and um the other point is that uh if it
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
turns out let's say it's
 
01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
$200,000 um that's not to say that's the
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
right number for problem gaming fund
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's uh what it comes to from like
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
these formulas and
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
practices uh but that's all it is and we
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
it may have landed in the right range or
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
or not let's look at that separately
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
sounding like it's going to double the
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
200 and effect you said 55% something so
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
let's call it 400,000 we'll find out a
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
number it would be roughly that it's
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's not as simple as it it won't
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily scale exactly one to one but
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
it should be roughly in that
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
neighborhood between 350 and 400 ,000
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
would be my guess the problem gaming is
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
a whole another issue on still on the
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
table that we have to address because
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
right now it's it needs work I
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
mean right now basically there's money
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
going out but it's not being
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
used it's from our prior meetings so
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
that that'll be back on the agenda
 
01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
pretty soon uh but at least we we have a
 
01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
source of revenues uh consistent source
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
of revenues yes we do have a source of
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue I would just uh add um that the
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
one of the limiting factors though is
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
what what is budgeted right now so I
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
believe what's budgeted for this year is
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
250,000 so obviously the breakage is
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't meet that number this year um
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
but if breakage exceeded the number uh
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
that was budgeted really right now with
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
the U the commission that's in place
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
right now they are limited at
 
01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:52.039 align:start position:0%
$250,000 without taking further action
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
so there is also that for the
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
consideration um of the Commission in
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
terms of recommendations coming out of
 
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
here is whether you know obviously
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
they'll be addressing the source but
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
also maybe addressing the the um the
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
budget side of that as well to allow
 
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
those sources those funds to flow
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
through to RG Services okay quick yeah
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
so John take homework assignment so um
 
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:20.039 align:start position:0%
if we could get take a look at the two
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
existing players and what percentage of
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
handle they they're paying um
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
extrapolate that out out for the for the
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
other players that aren't currently
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
paying and then kind of give us a fiscal
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
note if you will of what a bill like if
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
we if we were to establish at this
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of gross handle the people
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
that aren't paying would pay this much
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
people that are paying would continue to
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
pay this much and this is what the
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
revenue would look like at the end so we
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
kind of Canon have a big picture of what
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
this looks
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
you any other questions or comments on
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
this one okay
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
let's move on to agenda item seven range
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
of annual charity
 
01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:05.950 align:start position:0%
of annual charity
revenues

01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.279 --> 01:05:20.670 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
so we all got this document sent to us
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
and I've been inform everybody maybe it
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
was just me but this is It's a detail of
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
listing by facility of all the Charities
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
they sponsor or that sponsored
 
01:05:44.269 --> 01:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
them uh in the number of
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
days and what the allocations
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
were of uh to to the charity before rent
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
then then the HHR allocation then broken
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
out then it this gets broken out by HHR
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then GOC and then the
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
rent um Etc so and there's one sheet or
 
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of sheets depending on how big
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
the facility is uh listing all of
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
these so what I
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
I are you looking at um to yeah that's
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
that this is for the
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
this is for fiscal year uh calendar year
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's for calendar year
 
01:06:35.549 --> 01:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
23 we just got this sent from since the
 
01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:36.829 align:start position:0%
23 we just got this sent from since the
last

01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
meeting but anyway I took that to
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
summarize it and it's before you I have
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
the sheet looks like
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
this looks
 
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.549 align:start position:0%
this looks
like

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
um and it's just summarizing
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that it's going to
 
01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.549 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that it's going to
the

01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
Charities before rent okay before rent
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming that with rent going
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
away that these will more reflect the
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
numbers of what these Charities are
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
get and then well there's 14 locations
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
one two three 14
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
locations and you and I I I put them
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
based on the cont amount that's going to
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
Charities from each one of those facili
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
ities and you can see the Brooks on the
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
top at $8
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
million Gate City is comes in second
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
about 5.2 million bante too is at 4.5
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
million chases is about 4 million over
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
Poker Room about 2.2 then it goes all
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
down to Northwood
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
casino at
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
111,000 and you go up one from that Ace
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
and8 casino is at 13
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
3,000 and then one from that is is
 
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
conquer Casino while it was still open
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
the 338,000 so this is the amount that
 
01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.029 align:start position:0%
the 338,000 so this is the amount that
went

01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
went
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
Charities now interestingly enough you'd
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
say well Aces must not
 
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.309 align:start position:0%
say well Aces must not
have

01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
uh historic racing but they
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
do of and and
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
it's what actually goes to the charity
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
average day I what I did is because that
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
this report gave the number of calendar
 
01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
days that that U that each charity had
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
most have 10 a matter of fact that the
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
two far the three columns on the
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
left says how many 10 days slots did
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
each each like the brook had 70
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
Charities that had 10day blocks and
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
there were six others that had something
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
less than that equated to six that
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
equated to six days okay so so a total
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
of 76 Charities that they were involved
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
in Gate City had 71
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
Charities that functioned for 10
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
days and there were four others that
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
amounted to five
 
01:09:19.719 --> 01:09:21.510 align:start position:0%
amounted to five
days

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
so um excuse
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
me yeah
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
so basically there were
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
93.6% of the Charities had 10day blocks
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
across all of the facilities and 6.4% is
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
something less than five day 10 days
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
they may have had one they may have had
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
five in some cases they get at nine but
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's not 10 so I just wanted to just
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out
 
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.870 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out
but

01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
so you can
 
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.790 align:start position:0%
so you can
see

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
that depending on where you are you're
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
involved the average the average 10 days
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
at the brook average is
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
$110,000 for tells 10 days but
 
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough Chase's poker room
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
which doesn't have does not have
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines also you can
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
$110,000 so but they only sponsored 39
 
01:10:31.229 --> 01:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
Charities total okay some again n nine
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
of them will had less
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
than 10day
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
blocks and they then again they don't
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
have historic racing so they only the
 
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
maximum number days they can be open is
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
365 so uh with one
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor and then but then again if you
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
if you you look down you go wow
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
some of these places are pretty
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
small I mean uh and the Charities with
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
10 days would walk away with you
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
know like like four of them or under
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
$10,000 for that
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
effort um and but you could see you
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
could see the numbers yourself it it's
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
there are top tier if you will that are
 
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
larger and then there's those that are
 
01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.790 align:start position:0%
larger and then there's those that are
smaller

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
page and it is manually I did it every
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
$5,000 increments just to give you a
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
sense of the distribution of those
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
averages so Lakes Region for instance
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
there three of those
 
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
Charities were somewhere between receive
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere between Z and $5,000
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
16 received between 5,000 and $51 and
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
$110,000 13 between $10,000 and $1
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
15,000 or 13 of
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
them then 15 five six were between
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
15,000 100 so there
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
distribution one one want but between
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
20,000 and
 
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
25,000 so again there a lot of small
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
ones but then you get to the the bigger
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
ones then you get to Great Gate City and
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's quite a range of what the Charities
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
walked away with three were 45,000 to
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
50,000 16 what's the highest 50,000 to
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
55,000 but then there were there were
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
that night they must have had good dates
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
because there was one that walked away
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
with between 15,000 and 120 you can
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
identify them if you go to the
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
detail uh was one that was 135 to
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
140,000 one
 
01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.149 align:start position:0%
140,000 one
160,000

01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
160,000
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
165,000 so it's just not the average
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
that I talked about in the first sheet
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
how that distributes
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
out now we could say well maybe they had
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
good dates some of them or it could be
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
it could be a holiday weekend it could
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
whatever or could be that they did a
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
good job as a charity getting people to
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
come to the facility that they and
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with this there's
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with the
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
Charity saying to its membership hey we
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
got a charity night that's the way it
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
used to be we have a charity night make
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
sure you come and you know it could be
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
some of that here I don't know I have no
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
idea then you have a place like
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh CPR that's Chase's Chase's poker
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
room which does not have
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
historic racing who does quite well I
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
these Charities most of the Charities
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
are over
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
$100,000 okay that they that they that
 
01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.590 align:start position:0%
$100,000 okay that they that they that
they're

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
receiving um and then we have place like
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
the Brooke which is the TB on the top
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
there the
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
brook you know I looked at that one
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
number that 45 to
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
500,000 interestingly enough and that
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
one night or one
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
day they they did not have games of
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
chance going because it was Zero revenue
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the games of
 
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
chance uh but they had their historic
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
racing go for whatever reason maybe it's
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
because they only had one charity I
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't know but you can double check my
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
math when
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
you valer
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
but but at the brook again they're
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent you know most of them
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
they approached
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
100,000 and two two two
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
Charities were orang 140 to
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
145,000 and then one which is the top
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
gain of any of the facilities 180 to
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
185,000 so I I think data is important
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
to look at just to get a sense
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the distribution
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
here and and then if you look at the far
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
right column
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
um well the totals there doesn't matter
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
what facility what what how many how
 
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.110 align:start position:0%
what facility what what how many how
many

01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
Charities walked away with zero to 5,000
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
32 how many walked away 5,000 to
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
10,077 10,000 to
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
15, 148 that was the biggest number so
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
the key thing is that when you look at
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
the distribution
 
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
between zero and
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
25,000 that
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
represents 49.7% of the Charities let's
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
call half the
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
Charities that's their take okay
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
something less than 25,000 for 10 days
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
these are all 10 days these are 10day
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
numbers okay for 10
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
days you know but then you then then you
 
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
can see the distribution it goes up to
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know when you hit 50,000 between
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
Z and 50,000 that's well that's another
 
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
19.2% so that's
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
68% only only
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
125,000 as as a
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
charity uh and then if you if you look
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
between 100,000
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
8.3% of Charities make that amount so
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
um the reason I'm I'm talking about this
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
is because I was challenging myself in
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
one of the meeting saying you it's there
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
there going to be a day that in which
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
limit the upper end of the of what a
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
charity can receive or
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
not uh just thinking that as the
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
facilities grow
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
is this something that we're going to
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
have to quite a
 
01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.870 align:start position:0%
have to quite a
limit

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
limit
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
um right now it doesn't look that way
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
because it seems to be self-limiting but
 
01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
I think there's going to be a day when
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna I think I think we're still
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
gonna have to answer that
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
question um and then the mechanism to do
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
that is is up up to grabs um but
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
um what I'm going to try to do is I
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
think we should try to understand why
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
some of these Charities did so well
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
compared to the other
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
ones um is was it something that they
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
were able to do to bring more people
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
into the facility or not yep I actually
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
want to ask Norm his take on this
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
considering he's a charity and the idea
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
whe limiting the charity component model
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
and how much revenue they can make what
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
are your general thoughts on as a
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
charity who's representing Charities
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
that are receiving
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
room oh
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
I limiting here you're basically going
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
over and you're picking the winners and
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
losers all of a sudden um that if I
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
remember right here looking at some of
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
the information that we have got that we
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
have gotten over the the course of the
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
several months one thing that stuck out
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
to me here was I think it was at the
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
brook not sure facility but it was
 
01:18:44.629 --> 01:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
sponsored again it was a large day if
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
you want okay or week women's uh women's
 
01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.189 align:start position:0%
you want okay or week women's uh women's
business

01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
organization more than likely they went
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
over and they just pestered their
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
members get out there spend your money
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know I mean because that's uh and I
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
think that that's one of the items where
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
the dollars are really coming in
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
um I think you've got to give it a lot
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
longer period of time before all of a
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
sudden just that's you know going over
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
and all right we you know start limiting
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
all right because
 
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
the the cause has certainly you know
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
again an effect on bringing people in if
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
they if they uh send it out get an email
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
Facebook Facebook the uh other one is is
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
that uh some of those Charities if you
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
want have far again a a u they have an
 
01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.229 align:start position:0%
want have far again a a u they have an
extensive

01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
Service uh performance or service area
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
if you want that they're doing if it's
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
the cancel fund future in sight I'm
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
looking at uh
 
01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:48.870 align:start position:0%
looking at uh
versus

01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
a a local uh if you want organization
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
I'll you liance Club you know your
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
basically have a service area that that
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
encompasses several
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
towns uh some of the dollars go to the
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
to the state but it's a it's far
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
different again if you want your
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
operating budget from from a charity
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
Point than if you're looking at a
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh you know cancer
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
organization that they're servicing the
 
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
the entire state so that they they go
 
01:20:19.709 --> 01:20:19.719 align:start position:0%
over and and use every dollar usually
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
again that they that they can uh any
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
dollars not used again are are put aside
 
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
in the uh endowment or you know for for
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
future service so the limitations I
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
think here you can possibly look at in
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
several years and I think when you
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
finally get a stabilization if you want
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
of our of our gaming uh industry okay
 
01:20:41.239 --> 01:20:42.229 align:start position:0%
of our of our gaming uh industry okay
thank

01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
you any other comments on
 
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
that um I want to back it up to the
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
disparaging rates from the Charities I
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
mean we're dealing with gambling so
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
you're betting on people losing when
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
Charities win so just
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
for you know that sake you never know
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
when the best week is going to be I've
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
seen the best week in August I've seen
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
it in October I can't predict it I think
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
all of the rooms are planning promotions
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis so we're trying to
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
bring people in and doing things at our
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
expense to get people to get the foot
 
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
traffic it's highly competitive there's
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of rooms like I don't think
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's a day I walk in where every
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
single machine's filled by any means so
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
you move the machines around you change
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
the games it's a
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
constant something that we assess but I
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
will say for last year for Gate City
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
we're going back to a Monday to Sunday
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
block it does keep people on a little
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
more of a Level Playing Field we did 10
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
days last year because we weren't fully
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
expanded so we started with seven and
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
then I added three for each additional
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
charity because frankly they didn't make
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
what they made the year prior so they
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
budgeted for more we weren't fully
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
expanded the machine machines didn't
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
take off right away they're new to the
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
state so we were still building that
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
marketing plan but just to shed a little
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
light on some of
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
those different numbers and kind of how
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
that happens just so as far as the
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
ceiling I'm very hesitant um on putting
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
a ceiling on the numbers just because I
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
sit on three nonprofit boards and
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
there's always more we want to do and
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's things you don't do that you
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
can't do that fall to the Wayside
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
because you don't have the funding so I
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
think most could easily use more of the
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
funding and when we select Charities on
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
my committee that selects Charities I
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
pitch some Charities they select them
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
when we select them we keep in mind like
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
what is your mission statement where
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
what is this going to do for the
 
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
community and we decide dates on that
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
the Charities that got like a few more
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
condensed dates were basically the last
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
week of the month just for
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
little explanation there but sorry to
 
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.350 align:start position:0%
little explanation there but sorry to
back

01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
up yeah my concern was that you know
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
first I thought it was it was an eye
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
open for me to see that that someone
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
walked away with 180,000
 
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
plus um which is great I mean I'm not
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
discouraging that I'm just saying
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's because my my idea was that we
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to hurt anybody who's been
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
making a certain amount you know all
 
01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:25.390 align:start position:0%
making a certain amount you know all
along

01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
along
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know let's say 120,000 every
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
year so that we would we have to draw
 
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
the line somewhere but geez seems like
 
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
there's some that are making 180
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
140,000 now I haven't checked to see if
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's consistent every year or that's
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
just an operation for that particular
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
charity uh but again it's just it's on
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
the list of things to talk about um
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
joh um yeah I was just saying the um
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's true that the Charities are limited
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
to 10 days per month yeah it can be less
 
01:23:58.750 --> 01:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
than what's that year 10 days per year
 
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yes year oh so to me that's a
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
limiting factor right there I mean you
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
can only do so much in 10 days so um I I
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't know at this juncture I would be
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
against putting a cap on because the 10
 
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
days to me is a limiting
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
factor yeah so and I think I'm remember
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
as you or John brought it or Norm
 
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
brought it up but again you're almost
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
penalizing a charity that especially a
 
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide charity that pushes out to
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
their members everybody show up
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
everybody come and then everybody shows
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
up and comes and you don't get all the
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
money that was raised based on your
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
effort as a charity to come in do that
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
so again I kind of agree with John I
 
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
think our limiting factor is 10 days
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
you're never going to resolve the
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
disparity between Northwood casino and
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
the brook um and and in making Northwood
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
Casino somehow give more money to
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
charity um so I don't know how we would
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
pick stat as a legislature in a
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
statutory kind of thing so I like John I
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
think our limiting factors the 10 days
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
not the amount of money they make
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
because the effort matters um and so
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
either the effort of the casino to that
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
does advertising to get people in their
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
door or the effort of the charity to get
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
their members to bring their friends to
 
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
come in and support their cause um I
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
think we start putting caps on that
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're um penalizing effort
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
the lack of a better phrase so I'd be
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'd be resistant to do a a a cap I think
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
our cap is 10 days whether we want to
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
talk about bringing up down to seven so
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
we can get more charities in that's a
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable conversation I think um so
 
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
that we can service more Charities but I
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that we put a cop on a dollar
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
so in in uh from the front sheet what I
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
was talking from the total Charities
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
involved in uh 2023 was 800 even 800
 
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
Charities again most had 10 days 94% 95
 
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
almost well 94 let's call it
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
94% had had 10 days and I think it goes
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
back to that think G made the comment um
 
01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
um they're going to sday weeks it's
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
easier scheduling wise right because it
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
makes a difference you have 10 days that
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
includes two weekends you're make a heck
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
a lot more money than if you have seven
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
days only one weekend right because of
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
when people show up to game right and so
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
by going to that s-day window they can
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
both service more charity and equalize
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
playing field a little bit with the
 
01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
charity so I think that's a reasonable
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
kind of action but I think that's where
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
we should have our discussions around do
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
we want to stay at 10 or go down to
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
seven not do we want to cap how much
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
Gia just curious have you folks done any
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
kind of data analysis to figure out if
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
there's a correlation between specific
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
Charities their ability to bring people
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
in and some of the results that you know
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
we see here on the chart for Bri Gade
 
01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
City or is this just random it's random
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
and I think it has very little impact
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
like I love when they promote it if
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable promoting it I never
 
01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
want us to eliminate a cause because
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's against our Miss statement and I'm
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
not going to pressure them to promote it
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
like ever so I mean I it's nice if they
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
want to I support that you want to come
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
in I'll Reserve an area we'll promote it
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
you'll promote it I'll have my marketing
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
team make some material for
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
you but it's all about your comfort
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
level so that's something when I accept
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
the paperwork and we sign you know the
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork together and I mail it up we
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
have that discussion and I say if you're
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
interested I will connect you with my
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
marketing team if not that's okay
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it should be
 
01:27:32.669 --> 01:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
mandatory by any means and you would
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
lose a lot of Charities I mean it's
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
great I want the promotion but I'm not
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
going to force you to do something that
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't work with your mission
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
statement right technically it's it's
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh marketing if you will by
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
these by Charities they're doing it
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
because they know if they get more
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
people in the building
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
they're but but frankly like if people
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
don't win they don't come so like you
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
might invite somebody that wins a
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
lot um when we did the $50 Max bet I had
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
C come do a bet and I joked with him he
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
stole from charity because he won like
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
one spin on roulette and he donated
 
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
twice as much back so it was funny but
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh regardless like if they don't win
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
they don't come back so you can invite
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
all the people you want it really
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
depends on is that person winning or are
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
they losing and that is what correlates
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
to what they get that's the net you
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
cannot predict that but it's a no no
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
traffic is good no foot traffic is good
 
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
off for facility to say you have to have
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
a function one of those days that you
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
you right that we we do not do that I
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
will not speak forever but absolutely
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
like at my establishment we do not even
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
suggest like you have to have a function
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
I say if you want to come down during
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
your week I'm happy to host and and
 
01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.629 align:start position:0%
your week I'm happy to host and and
frankly

01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
typically I show up with my and I get
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
them around and sit them down and
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
reserve a little area like it's not like
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
a money maker by any means it's more
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
like thank you for coming and partnering
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
and supporting
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
us what the statute say on that so it is
 
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
not permissible to require any type of
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
event or to to cross sell a service in
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
order to get game dates it's something
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
that has been brought to the commission
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
attention before um and I don't think
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh something that happens often in
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
fact it was addressed in the um uh in
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
the study uh that we just went out we
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
asked the Charities whether they were
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
pressured to have an event or to uh buy
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
any services and I don't have the
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
results in front of me right now but it
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
was a very very small percentage of
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
people who indicated that they um felt
 
01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
any pressure to do an event or anything
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
um Associated at the facility but it is
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
not permitted at all and so if we get
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
any word of that we address it uh
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
immediately right but if the charity
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
decides to do something on their own
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
just to promote their dates that that
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
Mak sense and then and obviously the
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
facilities I mean there are facilities
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
ritiz and alandre pointed it out I mean
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
we see these TV commercials too but but
 
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
that's legitimate I mean they can
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
promote their their business don't helps
 
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
out yeah want to go back to the
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh uh limits on
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
revenues and uh I
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
share the thought that uh if
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
there AR to be limits they should be a
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
consequence of the numbers of days that
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
are allocated and um there are a couple
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
of ways of doing that one is to reduce
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
the numbers of days and expand the
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
number of Charities
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
um uh that can benefit it during any
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
particular day um and um
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
then that's one way that it it could be
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
accomplished um or or another thought is
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
that uh maybe for those Charities uh
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
those uh venues that
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
um Produce High
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
revenues maybe that's where you have
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
have a an additional day additional
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
charity involved each day uh we can
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
think about that but I I think we should
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
how there's no NE necessary correlation
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the system we now have between the
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
money that's generated and awarded to a
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
charity and the size of that charity or
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
the needs of that charity is just uh you
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
know you you get your days and you get
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
your money and now you've been running a
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh a little small
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
local uh charity for home homeless
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
people and you've got um five times the
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
money that you had before and now what
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
do you do with it well maybe it but it's
 
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
an ongoing flow of money so all of a
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
sudden you become a different kind of
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
entity than you were to start with you
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
know just now the randomness of this
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
current situation that we have it is and
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
I think I think folks I think the
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
Charities recognize that that they're
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with a smaller facility they're
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
not they're probably not going to make
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
that as much but it's still in the old
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
days $5,000 was a lot you know that they
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
were happy with with making something my
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
that that right now we're up to 800
 
01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
Charities at least for last count of
 
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
year and I'm looking at if con if cono
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
is totally kaput that's 35 Charities
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
that lost their place
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
to and some of these other smaller ones
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I mean how do they do
 
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
they exist forever and ever is it is it
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
going to be competitive for them to keep
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
on uh functioning I don't know that's a
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
Marketplace thing really that's uh but
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
you got to remember
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
50% of the Charities only receive
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
$25,000 or less
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
50% and I'm not worried about the
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
Brooker I'm not worried
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
about some of these other larger
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
facilities they they're going to do just
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
fine matter of fact their numbers are
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
going to grow what's going to happen is
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the number of Charities
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
are going to grow it's going to be the
 
01:33:47.109 --> 01:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
amount that each of the current
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
Charities are
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
get uh versus some of the smaller places
 
01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.229 align:start position:0%
get uh versus some of the smaller places
that

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
are more likely to run into financial
 
01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
problems on their own and not not be
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
there next year and then we what we've
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
done is have a net less loss on the
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
number of Charities that are are gaining
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
here that that's where my somewhere in
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
there there's we have to try to come up
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
with something that that
 
01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
will uh maybe not stop the growth in
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
what a charity gets but slow it down a
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
little bit so that we can let allow
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
other charities in now going in seven
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
days yeah that would do it that would
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
automatically do it it's going to hurt
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
some of the Charities though of that are
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
are getting 120,000 a year consistently
 
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
not only have seven days instead of the
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
10 days
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
so yeah it on one hand I almost feel
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
like it's a little bit premature to know
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
we would be limiting days or not because
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the complete
 
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
Marketplace looks like this Market is
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
still growing as we look at these
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
numbers year-over-year there's
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
significant gains that means um as
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
there's more significant gains and
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
licenses slowly increase there's still
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
plenty of Charities out there that want
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
to partake in this so it it's um I would
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
hesitate to make that determination
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
without kind of seeing where this
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
Marketplace is
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
going and I think we we're going to have
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
something to say about that too by the
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
end of this commission this to yeah what
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
what the ceiling should be it be the
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
number of machines or the number of
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
facilities or something there we we'll
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
get from the consultant what what's the
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable capacity of volume of
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
machines for a state our size to help us
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
guide us a little bit uh but you know no
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
one would have
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
envisioned if for real Casino bills if
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
you will real casinos I mean with the
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
maximum was maybe three or
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
four and we're going to have we're going
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
to have probably 19 once this is all
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
said and
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
done um but that may not stay some of
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
those guys may
 
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
merge right some of them may go out of
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
business you know I you know we don't
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
know I kind of agree with you John I I
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
think I think we have to put the we have
 
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
to kind of guess what the ceiling is
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
going to be here in terms of this well I
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
think one of these days we're going to
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
have to come to a decision how many how
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
many Charities are not being served yeah
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
at this point in time how many are not
 
01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
being served right right now we know
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
that there's there's a group that are
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
being are being who's not being served
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
that that's number one and how how does
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
that constituency get served what what
 
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
kind of things can be done at at the
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
state level to make sure that that that
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
that happens sort of like leveling the
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
playing field we talk about that all all
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
and I think as new items are introduced
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
we have historic horse racing now which
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
has been introduced big deal but what
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
else is going to be
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
introduced that's going to expand you
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
know the the ability to gamble which I
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
think is uh is critical as as we move as
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
we move forward here and and I think how
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
much is too much because I think you
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
pointed it out
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
the losers make
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
winners and and there there's a point
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
there's a point in time when the loser
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
the losers will become
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
problematic and that creates a series of
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
of social problems that that we have to
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with and as as this
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
grows I think that segment grows and
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's the problem gaming segment that
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to grow fa dramatically is
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
the number of entities grows all all
 
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
things that I think have to be have to
 
01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
be looked at
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
this you know this this has been growing
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
dramatically in the past 10 years
 
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.390 align:start position:0%
dramatically in the past 10 years
growing

01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
dramatically and the uh the concerns
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
associated with that grow at the same
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
time and all things that that you can't
 
01:38:21.589 --> 01:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
do everything you can't legislate
 
01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
everything but indeed
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
um think there's there's going to come a
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
point in time when we have to we're
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to do
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
something right it's you
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
know trying to be fair to the Charities
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
too here and that you know if the
 
01:38:43.149 --> 01:38:43.159 align:start position:0%
charity used to getting $120,000 a
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
year um I I personally will hesitate to
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
pull the plug on them and say hey well
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
no it's only going to be $90,000 a year
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh because many of them now become the
 
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
depended on this money they're used to
 
01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.229 align:start position:0%
depended on this money they're used to
this

01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:56.239 --> 01:38:57.910 align:start position:0%
this
money

01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm saying somehow I don't
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
have the I don't have the answer
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
obviously but I have the thought though
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
that something needs to be looked at
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
G before you said that these these
 
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
amounts or and these dates that it's
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
pretty random how the Charities perform
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
for our location yes for your location
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at your location
 
01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes like if you go to Hampton
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the summer is going to be
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
better of course we are pretty all over
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
the map year round in terms of the uh of
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
the Charities that you service is there
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
any kind of correlation maybe
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
year-over-year to how much money they
 
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
take out or I should really say receive
 
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
so to to address the chair's point if
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
charity a is used to getting
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
$125,000 a year is it
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
$125,000 every year or does it look
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
something more like hey this year it
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
might be 75 and next year could be 150
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then some other year it could be
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
45,000 is it more distributed like that
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
or is it like a consistent
 
01:40:12.719 --> 01:40:14.070 align:start position:0%
or is it like a consistent
year-over-year

01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
year-over-year
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
situation it it absolutely varies um for
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
us like over a 7-Day period like if
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's like what do I budget I'll
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
tell them budget 6 ,000 to be safe like
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to be riant in your
 
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
budget for year on this because it is a
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
Gamble and it does vary so it's a little
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
unpredictable last year we just weren't
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
done our expansion so people were
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
disappointed they helped get HHR pass
 
01:40:42.189 --> 01:40:42.199 align:start position:0%
they came and testified in front of many
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
of you and then I felt bad because it's
 
01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
like they're like well we got this
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
across and we made less money cuz they
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
did in the beginning till we fully
 
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.510 align:start position:0%
did in the beginning till we fully
expanded

01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
um and then something else I wanted to
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
mention was with the Charities like you
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
need Charities to operate that's a true
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
partnership so I want to keep in mind
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
when we talk about like I can go to
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
seven days because I've been we've been
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
operating I have a big waiting list it's
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
very easy for me to like put other
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
people in but in the beginning I was
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
begging people to come in partner and
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
they did not want to they weren't
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with gaming not everyone
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
qualifies New Hampshire is much much
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
more unique than like Delaware that we
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
heard where you have to meet a lot of
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
requirements so those checks and
 
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
balances are there which I support but
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
I'd be very hesitant with five potential
 
01:41:37.629 --> 01:41:37.639 align:start position:0%
rooms that will need two a day to drop
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
to seven because it might put some
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
people in a little bit of a pickle if
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
they can't find partners and then are
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
they just picking anybody at that point
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay Valerie while you're sitting there
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna ask you a question
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
Valerie is there any seasonality to
 
01:41:56.589 --> 01:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
somebody I mean ocean probably ocean may
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
have some seasonal ocean gaming may have
 
01:41:59.239 --> 01:42:00.589 align:start position:0%
have some seasonal ocean gaming may have
some

01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:11.589 --> 01:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
the microne except for those rooms that
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
are as Gia said on on Hampton Beach
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
because they attract more business in
 
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
the summer than they would in the winter
 
01:42:20.669 --> 01:42:20.679 align:start position:0%
um I I also want to point out that some
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
of the increase in the revenue is due to
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
the $50 bet and the addition of HHR
 
01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
which 5 years ago they weren't making
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
this much money they've it's increased
 
01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
year-over-year as we've increased the
 
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
overall yeah if I if I could just add to
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
that too so there's obviously there's
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
places where there's clear seasonality
 
01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:49.639 align:start position:0%
um however I think the problem with
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
making fundamental judgments on this
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
data right now is like you're looking at
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
calendar year 23 the beginning of
 
01:42:58.109 --> 01:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
calendar year 23 looked nothing like the
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
end of calendar year 23 um we're still
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
in a massive growth cycle between the
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
$50 bet uh which came into effect July 1
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
23 um G is referencing her facility
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
which is a good actually good template
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
for where many of the facilities are
 
01:43:15.629 --> 01:43:15.639 align:start position:0%
right now which is they are growing out
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
their HHR machines um so what H got in
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
January of 23 at one facility would look
 
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
completely different than what they
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
would get in December of 23 so right now
 
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
we're in such a growth cycle with regard
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
to um obviously the the legal changes on
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
the games of chance side but also one
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
the build out of machines and then um
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know the operators are also refining
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
their techniques uh refining the game
 
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
choices understanding their um I think
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
understanding their player databases and
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
how to drive those players more
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
efficiently to the facility so um we
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
are it is a there there is a lot of
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
change in this data in 23 but I don't
 
01:44:04.589 --> 01:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
think it's related necessarily to um
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
seasonality and it's probably
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
significantly more related to growth
 
01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.550 align:start position:0%
significantly more related to growth
right

01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:12.679 align:start position:0%
now I count I count four rooms that
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
don't have historic racing
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
machines uh chases the river River
 
01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:24.030 align:start position:0%
machines uh chases the river River
Casino

01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh Parker which is know holding pattern
 
01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.030 align:start position:0%
uh Parker which is know holding pattern
and

01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
Northwood was there one other
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
a 31 Char 31 no but I saw I saw they I
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
when I looked at the revenues they had
 
01:44:42.669 --> 01:44:42.679 align:start position:0%
historic racing Aces and eight does have
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
historic course racing they were
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
previous uh previously a um seasonal
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
room they would close down for the
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
winter so that's why they don't have the
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
all right I do think that we're trying
 
01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
to build an airplane in the air right we
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
made so many changes and you know so I I
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
think it struggle when we start talking
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
about making significant changes I don't
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
think we've seen what normal is yet
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
because we keep changing the normal um
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
and so you guys keep at it too hey you
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
were you were
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
there so we I'll take some of the heat
 
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
but not all the heat um but you know are
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
legislatively we're making hu you know
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
how many gaming bills we've had in the
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
last four you know three terms right and
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
and and that have been proved in pass
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
and and the gaming operators are trying
 
01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
to play catch up right now we got a new
 
01:45:36.669 --> 01:45:36.679 align:start position:0%
law we got to adjust and change again
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
and that changes the norm and so I I'd
 
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
be you know I'd encourage like G did the
 
01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
the gaming rooms to move the seven days
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
a week to to be able to get to more
 
01:45:49.229 --> 01:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
charities in the Hampshire so more
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
Charities have opportunities I don't
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
know that we should legislate it yet
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
again because I think we're building a
 
01:45:57.790 --> 01:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
plane in the air um and so um just
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
cautious about more changes until we can
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
figure out what this thing looks like
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
and I think Spectrum will help us with
 
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
that um because they're a little bit
 
01:46:06.189 --> 01:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
better at prognostication looking out in
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
the future and seeing what's going on
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
based on current law and based on um
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the market overall
 
01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um you know let's not forget
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
that we still don't know what this going
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
to look like because you know if we look
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
at our state revenues what's going on
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
with them right now right they're
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
they're a little behind and we don't
 
01:46:25.470 --> 01:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
know whether charitable gaming is going
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
to follow that same path yet or not
 
01:46:29.589 --> 01:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
either whether or not it's going to be a
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
continu its growth path or see a a
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
Slowdown in growth as we do with some of
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
the other revenues the business revenues
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
that are coming to the state so um I
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
just caution again too many dramatic all
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
right we got 10 minutes left um I got
 
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
two other agend agenda items uh one was
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
temporary regulations and I put Tim's
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
name Senator Lang's name here this is
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
just building off of Mark your comment
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of the last
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
meeting I want to make sure
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
that I would spend more time on this if
 
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
you feel we need to spend more time on
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
this it sounds like jel car does some
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
stuff that is temporary but it may not
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
be everything that we
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
need I want to make sure I'm addressing
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
are okay just wanted okay thank you
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
right and then on my 20 some plus list
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
of things hosting Community Revenue we
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
haven't really talked in this room about
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
it that much uh but it's a
 
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and is that in one of the
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
many bills that's out there 472 that's
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
it the one we just sent over to the
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
house it has a an option basically to
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
treat a municipality just like a charity
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
however again we the bill focuses on the
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
idea that this is always supposed to be
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming so the Charities have
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
the right of first refusal before any
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
town would get any days so well I agree
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
again but the idea again we focus that
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
the legislators made a conscious
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
decision to talk about charitable gaming
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
and that this is about the Charities and
 
01:48:12.910 --> 01:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
so we put we put options in there for
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
towns so so if there are operators that
 
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
have room in their Cal in their schedule
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
they can insert however we don't mandate
 
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
that they insert that if they have a
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
waiting list the charity com first and
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
then the town comes in what was the bill
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
472 sp sp s SP 472 it's currently in
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
front of it passed the Senate and it's
 
01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
currently in front of house and John
 
01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
said they're GNA look at it in two weeks
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
we've already had the public hearing so
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
so we have a we put a component in there
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
to allow it but just understand we were
 
01:48:44.669 --> 01:48:44.679 align:start position:0%
focusing on Charities not the
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and we made it so
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
Charities have a right of first refusal
 
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
on all dates so by the time it we meet
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
again this probably would have been
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
voted out of your committee one way or
 
01:48:57.790 --> 01:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
another right
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay s there's a good chance we'll have
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
a work session a week from tomorrow um
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
whether we execute that day or not that
 
01:49:07.229 --> 01:49:07.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know obviously right now were
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
there any issues in the Senate with this
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
bill we added the municipal piece in um
 
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
from the origin we added the municipal
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
piece in uh based on comments and
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
everything else we added uh based on the
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
um not for Center for not for-profits
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
they asked us to make it South Chari
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
were the Frontline component we all
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
agreed in the Senate if I remember right
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
Lou you can correct me but I'm pretty
 
01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
sure it was a 5- z vote coming out of
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Ways and Means everybody agreed
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
it was unanimous vote on the floor um
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
and a Voice vote on the floor so um
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
again I was no no consternation that
 
01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
that I recall in in I'll put this on
 
01:49:45.629 --> 01:49:45.639 align:start position:0%
next week next meeting's agenda it would
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
have been a probably votes by that point
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
um we will we can see if that's if if
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
the structure of that is what the
 
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
commission longterm wants to see for the
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
communities or not we would have to
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
answer you we would have at least have
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
discussed it whether we've exed or not
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know depends okay yeah but we will
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
have had a work session and and possibly
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
EXA it okay very
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
good all right let's talk about the next
 
01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
meeting uh I'm going to recommend May
