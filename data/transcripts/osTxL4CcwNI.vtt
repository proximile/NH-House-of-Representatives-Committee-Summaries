i know most of a lot of your communities
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
do have things that i will say
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
if i could please take the liberty of
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
saying good morning representative smith
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see you on zoom
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
in in the flesh and not in the picture
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
i i got to get that picture background
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
figured out but
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
well it's always a pleasure to see you
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
thanks all right um
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
let's see so the purpose of the meeting
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
that has been scheduled has been to
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
officially receive the bills for
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
redistricting before this special
 
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.589 align:start position:0%
redistricting before this special
committee

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
before deadlines there's been some
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
change to the deadlines but this hearing
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
was scheduled before that was known
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that i think most of
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know we have no redistricting data
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
to use to begin our work
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh that is not expected to be available
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
until september
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
i think the the official federal word is
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
sort of on or before september 30th
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
i think the initial release dates were
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
expected to be
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
april so it has significantly impacted
 
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.710 align:start position:0%
april so it has significantly impacted
the

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
time frame that we have to do the work
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
and as a result while the rules require
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
us to take this bill into committee
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
there really is nothing
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we can do on it before our
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
deadlines for action to be voted on by
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that we can
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
receive the bills retain them
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
and see if there's anybody attending who
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
wants to make a comment
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and then have a brief discussion
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
about scheduling a meeting where we
 
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.790 align:start position:0%
about scheduling a meeting where we
discuss

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in regards to
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
consideration of these bills in the
 
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
consideration of these bills in the
future

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
from a scheduling standpoint for the
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee at which time we can get into
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
discussion of how we're going to proceed
 
00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:26.869 align:start position:0%
discussion of how we're going to proceed
because

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
i i want to proceed as a committee with
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
reason you have no one signed up

is because there was no ability on the
um

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%

at town meeting four cities have passed
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
this uh resolution as well as the town

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
issue that's
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
important to everyone
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
and well we don't need to dwell on what
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
happened 10 years ago i think it's
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
important that this committee understand
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
the history and work as well as they can
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%

you the the one that the city of
franklin

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
franklin
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
passed um as well but i think um
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
as cities i'll just speak from the the
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
city perspective
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
our city lions are in our charter and
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
with the data that are coming out
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
september 30th there will be no ability
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
for our city
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
and the city of franklin to amend our
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
charter which is an october election
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
um before you do your work so we will
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
probably be
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
be doing that in a different time frame
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
so i think with the delay in the
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
in the data this year we'll also have to
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
think about how how do the
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
municipal lines that have to be drawn
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
play into your work as well
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%

anybody else in attendance i see 16
people

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
um have logged on to this meeting and if
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to say anything
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
if you could raise your hand we would
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right representative maguire did you
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
have something
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair this is
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
happened in the previous
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting which i know about only
 
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.509 align:start position:0%
redistricting which i know about only
peripherally

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
peripherally
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
and it's a policy decision that we need
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
to make before we actually start
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
crunching numbers
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
i i live in one of three towns on the
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
edge of merrimack county
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
the populations add up to four
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh well within the the uh
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
plus or minus five percent
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
the every each of the three towns has
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
enough population from at least one
 
00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:07.749 align:start position:0%
enough population from at least one
representative

00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
but last last last redistricting
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
we determined that because of the plus
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
or minus five percent
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
on floatarials instead of having one
 
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.030 align:start position:0%
on floatarials instead of having one
district

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
in each of the three towns with one
 
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.150 align:start position:0%
in each of the three towns with one
representative

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
and one in the float we ended up with
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
two of the towns
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
being combined in a base district and
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
the third one
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
separate and then one in the float and
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
people who were working on the previous
 
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.030 align:start position:0%
people who were working on the previous
redistricting

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
told me that if 12 people
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
had moved from the larger town to the
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
smaller town
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
we could have gotten the one one one
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
plus a float which
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
many of the people in the towns would
 
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
many of the people in the towns would
prefer

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i determined that that was because
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
of the way
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
the plus or minus five percent from
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
one man one vote was being applied to
 
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.350 align:start position:0%
one man one vote was being applied to
floaterials

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
floaterials
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that in this case
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
the result was not what most of the
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
people would have wanted
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
it violates our constitutional provision
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
that every town that's big enough has
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
its own representative
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore i think we as a committee
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
should be looking at how we do those
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
calculations so it doesn't happen again
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
to somebody else
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you i know that i myself come from
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
a town that's part of a floatario
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
i i think that it will i think that the
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
census data will be quite interesting
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
because i think there has been a big
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
change in population in the state over
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
and we are very fortunate to have with
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
us someone who actually was
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
part of the prior process as far as i
 
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.190 align:start position:0%
part of the prior process as far as i
know

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
and that would be representative weber
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
weber i see that you have your hand up
 
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
weber i see that you have your hand up
um

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
please join us with audio thank you
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
and chair and just to add to the
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts of the
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
prior speaker i will note that i
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
am in a four-member four-town district
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
which after our constitutional amendment
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
that said that each town that had more
 
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.669 align:start position:0%
that said that each town that had more
than

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
the magic number which was 3291 the last
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
time around
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
would get their own representative my
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
district actually got larger
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
as a result of that i i now represent
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
four towns
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh the one of which takes me nearly an
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
hour to get to the other end of
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and we too are
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
in a clump where three of us are
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
entitled to our own reps but
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility that the town of
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
westmoreland could
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
elect four representatives and the other
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
three towns have none
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
so i just put that into the mix as yet
 
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
so i just put that into the mix as yet
another

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
issue where we are going to find that we
 
00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:05.029 align:start position:0%
issue where we are going to find that we
are

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
unable to satisfy both the new hampshire
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
constitution which requires us
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
each town that has the requisite number
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
to have its own representation
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
and the federal requirement that each
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
person's vote weighs equally
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
and that's because we choose not to do
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
census districts
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
when every other state most every other
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
state does
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
many other states i don't know the exact
 
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.270 align:start position:0%
many other states i don't know the exact
numbers

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a fact of life that we're
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to grapple with
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i just throw that out there as
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
another another fish to be dealt with
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you well and the uh and
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative weber thank you for your
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
experience and your ability to just
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
recall the 3491 number
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
because of course we can expect that
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
number to change because the population
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
has of course changed
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
so individually we're all going to be
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
looking at a district that
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be probably unlikely that
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
it stays
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
exactly the same just by virtue of the
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
population growth and shift that's
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
occurred over the last 10 years
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that of course is going to be a
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
discussion on the committee not only
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
between us
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
but with our constituents in regards to
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
that there has been
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
much talk about a public hearing process
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that i'm aware that
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
there there were complaints about the
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing process that occurred
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
last time i don't
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
really know there was a complaint that
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
they were sort of hearings with no data
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
this is going to create a dilemma for
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
the committee because if we don't have
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
any data until september
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we need to do something for next
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
year um
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
really how are we going to go about our
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
work we're going to
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to follow that's
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
meaningful for everybody
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i think quite frankly that's a
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
meeting in and of itself
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
um just to discuss um the options that
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
are out there and how we proceed
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
so while we have bills in front of us
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
that i'll be looking for
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
to retain on so we can continue our work
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
on them
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
um i would like to have some discussion
 
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.470 align:start position:0%
um i would like to have some discussion
about

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
when given the calendar for the house
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we have right now and what we
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
expect coming
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
um i frankly i am not looking at a next
 
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.470 align:start position:0%
um i frankly i am not looking at a next
meeting

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
of this committee for it till after
 
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.390 align:start position:0%
of this committee for it till after
mid-april

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
mid-april
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
with the things that are going on and i
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
just want to know
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
sort of from a committee standpoint does
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
anybody have
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
any specific considerations that should
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
be taken
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
into account in regards to scheduling
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative weber i don't but i
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
do note that scheduling this
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
term is much more difficult because we
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
do not have dedicated days on which our
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
committees meet
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
and my committee meets mondays and
 
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.789 align:start position:0%
and my committee meets mondays and
fridays

00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
fridays
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh occasionally which
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
were the days that used to be protected
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
for special committees
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
so scheduling is going to be a complete
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
nightmare but
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
like everybody else on the screen here i
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
have no idea what my schedule
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
is going to be until thursday afternoon
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the week before
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
when the calendar comes out so that's
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a challenge for you madam
 
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
going to be a challenge for you madam
chair

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
all right look forward working we'll
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
figure out and try to do the best we can
 
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.110 align:start position:0%
figure out and try to do the best we can
i

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
anticipate at least for our committee
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
work initially um
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to continue as the
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
zoom platform it gives us flexibility to
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
participate that representative weber
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
would appear to be the best example of
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
how to be flexible and do it
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
today representative bergeron i noticed
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry i did not recognize you
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
were you all set or did you want to say
 
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.669 align:start position:0%
were you all set or did you want to say
something

00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
well i think i just want to share a
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
little information to uh
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
build upon what miss zinc said about
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
some of the problems with cities
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
i did the redistricting in nashua in
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
2001 and 2011
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
and in both instances the war data
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
provided by the u.s census bureau
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
their ward boundaries did not follow our
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
actual ward
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
and as a result we use this the us
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
census data to create
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
our ward lines only to find out we had
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
to go back to the voters of nashua to
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
redraw those lines
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
after gis showed us that some of the
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
census tracts that
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
the census bureaus belonged in one ward
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
were actually
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh covering two wards manchester had the
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
same problem i don't know
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
if it occurred in both 2011 and 2001
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
but again the census boundaries didn't
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
match up with the actual ward boundaries
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
in most instances the cities can deal
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
with that internally
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
in their own redistricting for their
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
ward lines but if there are floaters
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
that cross over into cities
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a concern i think as
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
well for our committee
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair i guess the
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
only question i had
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
in light of the fact that uh the census
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
data will not be available
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
until september i'm i guess i i mean
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong you tell me when when
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
to be there and i'll be there but i'm
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i understand what
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
um what is what will be the purpose of
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
the meetings you were talking about
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
having for example in april and may i if
 
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.470 align:start position:0%
having for example in april and may i if
we

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the data what what are
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
we what are we going to do with those
 
00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:28.470 align:start position:0%
we what are we going to do with those
meetings

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative lynn thank you for the
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
question i think there needs to be a
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
discussion with the committee about the
 
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.789 align:start position:0%
discussion with the committee about the
process

00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
welcome to the new hampshire house this
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
year redistricting is not a new issue
 
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.190 align:start position:0%
year redistricting is not a new issue
for

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
anybody who has been in this house for
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
the last few sessions
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
it has been a subject of
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
legislation now for a few sessions
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
with different results from different
 
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.350 align:start position:0%
with different results from different
sessions

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
and there has been much input as to into
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
the process that should be followed and
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
it is my belief that if we wait until we
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
have the data
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
we will be spending more time with each
 
00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:13.190 align:start position:0%
we will be spending more time with each
other

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
than anybody else in our lives come
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
october 1st
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
so it is my hope that we can
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
as a committee come together with some
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
sort of a process
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
as to how to proceed and it might be
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
that why public
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
while public hearings without data were
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
a complaint apparently of the last
 
00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:35.029 align:start position:0%
a complaint apparently of the last
session

00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
given our ability to do it on the zoom
 
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.070 align:start position:0%
given our ability to do it on the zoom
platform

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
platform
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
we might want to have some input into
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
communities and their representation
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
as to the floatarial issues so we have
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
some background on
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
individual communities i can tell you on
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
the election law committee
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
we have heard for a few sessions from
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
members of communities who got
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
sucked into a floaterial in the last
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
redistricting and as a result
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
effectively felt they lost their
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
representatives so
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
um i think those kind of things can be
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
heard without necessarily having
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
the actual data in front of us
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
if you thank you very much madam chair
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
um i believe you're recognizing me i
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that with two
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
smiths on
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
the committee you're going to have to
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
train yourself
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
to decide or to to include a first name
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
or some other way of
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
of differing which smith you're calling
 
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.230 align:start position:0%
of differing which smith you're calling
never

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
occurred to me until you said that thank
 
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
occurred to me until you said that thank
you

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
i fortunately realized you hadn't asked
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
me to introduce the bills so i knew that
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
was representative steven smith
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
i want to uh second enthusiastically
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
what the chair just
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
said we have process and we have
 
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.390 align:start position:0%
said we have process and we have
substance

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
substance
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
at the moment the substance is
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh just not available to us
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
at the moment that it is we're going to
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
ready to go on there are all kinds of
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
process decisions that this committee
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
could and i believe should make
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
um one of them that's been mentioned
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
several times
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
is the importance of having public
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
meaningful public input um
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
and where in fact we do have um
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh public hearings where
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
there is data for the public to evaluate
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we can't do
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
until we have the data but in terms of
 
00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:46.630 align:start position:0%
until we have the data but in terms of
process

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that we can do we can try
 
00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:50.630 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that we can do we can try
to

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
develop guidelines about
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
floaterial districts we can
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
gather guidelines about
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
public input we can gather uh
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines about the factors that we
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
include when we
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
set up lines we can look at the
 
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.389 align:start position:0%
set up lines we can look at the
constitutional

00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and see both national
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
and state and see what we want to do
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have districts
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
that conform as closely as possible
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
to city and town
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
lines we know we can't cross counties
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
that i think is a rule that we're all
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
willing to observe for the house
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
although obviously not for the senate or
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
executive or any of the others but if we
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
could get
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of those process questions
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
um uh through this committee and have a
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
sense of where we want to go
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
before we are influenced even
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
by the specific numbers i think we would
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
be sending a message
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
to the public and to ourselves
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
that we really want this to be as fair
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
and open a process as is possible
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
and so i commend the chair for
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
process is important and we can have
 
00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:24.549 align:start position:0%
process is important and we can have
that

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
under our belt so to speak before we get
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
number thank you
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marjorie smith
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the committee
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
all right um we have before us
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
six bills that have been introduced hb
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
50 through
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
55 representative steven smith would you
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
yes and well first inquiry of the chair
 
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.430 align:start position:0%
yes and well first inquiry of the chair
certainly

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
should the motion be for all six bills
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
or do you prefer to take them up one at
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
a time
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
really um yes i've i've never
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
seen a um a group um
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
vote on on multiple bills at the same
 
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.029 align:start position:0%

press really firmly
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make a plea
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
that before you schedule the next
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
hearing you also discuss with your
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
fellow chairs as to when they're going
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
to be meeting
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
because as we know they are going to be
 
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.069 align:start position:0%
because as we know they are going to be
meeting

00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
every day of the week and as as somebody
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
who has chaired a second committee
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
in the past it's very helpful when
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
people are not stuck trying to go to two
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
meetings at the same time it will help
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
