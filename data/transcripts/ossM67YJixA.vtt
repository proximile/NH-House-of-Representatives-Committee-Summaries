copies
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
um uh represent McDonald would you like
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
to speak to uh the amendment sure the
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
amendment does two things the first is
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
changes the duties of the committee
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
because it makes it more investigative
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
rather than saying what the committee is
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to find out before they
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually have the time to investigate
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
this important issue and the another
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
thing is it amends section five of the
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill which is the reporting requirements
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
it says that the Speaker of the House

representative SEL I'm sorry oh thank
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
you I just had a question so in the
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
original bill it talks about the report
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
goes to the um Speaker of the House the
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate the house clerk
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
the governor and the State Library this
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
amendment keeps the governor but removes
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate clerks um and my
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
understanding from the work I did on a
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
study committee last year is that those
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
two have to be included but um and so I
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to yeah to clarify I I've
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
never heard that they have to be
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
included okay but you
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
um we can sure make sure that the
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
speaker does uh send additional copies
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
out okay I just I just want to make sure
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
that we're not in a way that would cause
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative thank you just
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
my my question deals with the um line
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
five of the uh Amendment rep Amendment
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
um where it's talking about summarizing
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
evidence-based studies since these the
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
surveys um a lot of may just be
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
informational because collecting data
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
from different schools I'm not sure
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to have all going to be
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
evidence based if we if you went down we
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
have 10 15 20 people on this committee
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
if we went to every one of those school
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
systems they would tell us
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
informationally what what they've seen
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
um so I I I don't know how those to Mel
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
I don't see the survey part is sort of
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
informational may not be evidence-based
 
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
because they think a survey what you do
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
um but it seems to me when I look at
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
line five it it restricts that only to
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based studies and I'm not sure
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
I don't I have no problem adding it in
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
there but you see what I mean right I I
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
I think it makes it makes like the
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
allarm is going to be informational
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
versus evidence based right I I don't
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
see a problem um you know with with that
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
I think um there will also be uh
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
existing as you indicated um additional
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
school policies um uh on the subject
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
taking a look at um uh I I just think
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
that the um studies that are presented
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
the uh um the maker of the uh uh
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment um wanted those studies to be
 
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:32.950 align:start position:0%
Amendment um wanted those studies to be
uh

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh in addition to yeah in
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
addition to okay right thank you thank
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
you um yeah I I think we're the
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee is just really um collecting
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
information um and then it's you know
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
okay as opposed to the original um bill
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
which seemed to indicate that we were
 
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be making a recommendation
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
or or providing some statutory language
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
about schools times I think appr I
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that just concerned that we
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
didn't get that's fine I thank
 
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you very much I'm sorry
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
especially as I'm only just seeing the
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
amendment today um y the other question
 
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
that I have has to do with whether we
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
should be also incorporating the fact
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
that we have districts within the state
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
who've reviewed um this discussion and
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
made decisions and shouldn't that be
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
somehow Incorporated that they should be
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
looking at why District in the state may
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
have already decided in favor of or
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
oppose to some I just I'm just concerned
 
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
that we're limiting in some capacity by
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
not talking about local districts rather
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
than State policies right
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
I I I don't see any
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
um drawback to um looking at that I
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
think um clearly the intent during all
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion um was to uh um look at
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh information from um existing
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
districts that have already studied it
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
um I know representative McDonald you've
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
talked about that would you like to
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
mention yes anything in that regard
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
actually the reason I support this
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
amendment is because my district in
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
Salem that's SAU 57 we had looked at
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
this because a number of students
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
including such students like The free
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
girls K lcer of peterborg that testified
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
and determined that we were not able to
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
do this because of bsing and also
 
00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
because of our CTE Center at the Salem
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
High School and so I like this amendment
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
because the result of the committee
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
could be that it's up to local control
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
and districts like Salem can't do this
 
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:40.559 align:start position:0%
whereas the bill as proposed the duties
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
make it seem as if the goal of the
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee is to make this possible
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
everywhere where some communities such
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
as mine determine that it's not possible
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
as of now at least it's not
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
possible thank
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
you um for the
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
discussion see
 
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
um Madame clerk if you could uh take a
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%

to applaud representative wheeler for
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this to the Forefront this has
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
been an issue that we've discussed for
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
many years we had people come and
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
testify and if I remember correctly we
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
did not have anyone testify opposed to
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
this bill I also just wanted to take it
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
a step further and say that
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Terry made a point
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday of letting us know that he was
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
in touch with representative wheeler

you very much Mr chairman this is a a
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
repeat bill from last bium and it had
 
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
problems then and it has problems now
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem is that it requires
 
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
background checks of private citizens by
 
00:55:33.549 --> 00:55:33.559 align:start position:0%
private citizens and that makes it very
 
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
difficult the private citizens cannot
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
make background checks on other private
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
citizens and all the results have to go
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
to state agencies when home schooling
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
families become EFA students they their
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
home education program is terminated but
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
and they become EFA students this bill
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
as it's written has um any employ or
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer that has in-person instruction
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
with an EFA student has to have a
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
background check so there's a lot of
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
ways that um Home Educators run into
 
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
other people who are in person
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
instruction um including people in
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
co-ops who are actually regular home
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
education students who would have to be
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
um have background checks so there's a
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
lot of questions this is just a
 
00:56:24.029 --> 00:56:24.039 align:start position:0%
beginning list was who uh does it
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
require background checks on everybody
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
that a home schooling family turned EFA
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
runs into who pays for them who requests
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
the checks who would receive the results
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
who would monitor compliance is there a
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
penalty for non-compliance that's just
 
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
the start of the list of questions I
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
legislate second thank you um any
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%

Cornell yes I agree with the um itl on
 
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
this um although I do think that um
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
people working with students should have
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks but I I do
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
agree that it it doesn't work with the
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
193a homeschool families um which in the
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
last bill we were supposed to work on it
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
with them to make sure that this one was
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
better and we didn't do that so I would
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
like to see this bill come back in the
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
future um but with working with those
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
homeschool families to see that it it it
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
works for them too so but I do agree
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
that this bill doesn't work now thank

speak to your motion yes for the the
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
time that I've been on this committee I
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
have heard over and over about the the
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
three-legged stool for Education which
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
is parents students and teachers and I
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
think that that the parents part is
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
missing from the the the code of conduct
 
01:00:34.029 --> 01:00:34.039 align:start position:0%
and the code of ethics part in here of
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
people that we're responsible to and I
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
would like to include it this bill does
 
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:41.559 align:start position:0%
it thank you represent
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
Morris any comments from anyone else on
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
the committee on 235 representative
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank the chair um I appreciate
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
the the maker of the Motions uh intent I
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
think our responsibility is educating is
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
is to the students and they're our
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility thank you thank
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
Boni um yes I will not be voting for The
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
it um for the OTP on this bill uh
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
because I believe that um it's already
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
parents are already included in the code
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
of conduct under the Community section
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
and as a representative Woodcock said
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
the teacher primary responsibility is to
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
the student uh with consultation with
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
the parent I mean I think that's already
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
in there this bill gives no explanation
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
of how these responsibilities to parents
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
are going to or or what those
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities will be or how they
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
will be identified um the previous code
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
of conduct was put together um it has a
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
group effort with stakeholders involved
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
um if you open up the code of conduct it
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
goes straight back to the rules and
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that there is going
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
to be that um continued St holder input
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
in deciding what those responsibilities
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be and so for that reason I
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the OTP thank you
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you Mr chair I
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
too will be voting against the OTP um in
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
addition to it already being U mentioned
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the community section of the ethics
 
01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:17.559 align:start position:0%
guideline it is also noted in 21 N1 uh
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
that parents are enumerated in statute
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
within our book so for that reason I
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
will not be supporting autopass thank
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%

01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
question for uh chairman cordelli
 
01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
actually two um first is uh who help who
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
um did you work with in developing this
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
language um and the second question just
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
curious why you removed um on page two
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
um of the amendment uh line 11 and 12
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
and you actually moved it
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
to um just on the first page lines 13
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
and 14 it's about the adoption of rules
 
01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
is there any particular reason it was
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
done that way and also like I said um
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
where did the where who who was
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for determining this
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
language in To better clarify right
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%

01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%

um that this this language needs to be
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%

01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
discussion just again a clarification of
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
why that particular sentence was moved
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
about the rules into 1B rather than
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
where it was on uh at the end of the
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.590 align:start position:0%
 
12

01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
12
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh I I believe it was just to um make
 
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
clear that the rules would be uh in
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
relation to all three um methods of
 
01:29:21.119 --> 01:29:22.270 align:start position:0%
relation to all three um methods of
dispute

01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
resolution um
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
whether that move was required um it
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
probably was not required but um that's
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
what they uh developed with the
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
amendment in their discussions so the
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
clarification was just to make sure that
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
the rules appli to all three methods
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray uh thank you
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
um Madam Vice chair um my question for
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
the chair as well is are do you envision
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
that all of the the rules making
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
Authority granted um would be the same
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
for neutral conference and mediation as
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
it would be for IEP since we are they're
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
technically separate from one another
 
01:30:07.229 --> 01:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
right I I I believe that the rules would
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
not apply in Mass to all three but there
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
would be individual there would be rules
 
01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
specific to each of the three I see okay
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
so you you're envisioning that Ru making
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
would be granted individually to each of
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%

01:30:36.239 --> 01:30:38.270 align:start position:0%

we're going to open the executive
 
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
session on HB 564 relative to the
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
adoption of school administrative unit
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
budgets and I recognize representative
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
cordelli for a
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you m chairman um I
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
would like to move uh that we retain
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
house buillt 564
 
01:33:55.709 --> 01:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
second representative moris
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
seconds discussion from the maker of the
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
motion thank you um we had this
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
bill um last term as
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
well and we moved um I believe it was
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
either retain or interim study on it um
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
we uh ended up not doing anything with
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
that uh but I think that um during the
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
hearing um that we had um a week ago on
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
this bill I think there was still
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
confusion um related uh to um some of
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
the provisions especially um in relation
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
to uh single uh District saus versus
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
multi-district saus and how that would
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
um apply in each case uh to separating
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
out the uh SAU budget from The District
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
budget um I think this since this is the
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
um Second Time Around in two years with
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
this budget um I think maybe we could U
 
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
take a look at this um uh during the
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
fall um there's no rush on this um we
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
just have to would um uh report uh out
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
on it uh in November and it would be
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
taken up on the house floor then in
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
January I believe
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
um but I think um at least you know
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
let's take another look since since this
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
is the uh Second Time Around on it and
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
see if we can get some uh clarification
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
and um uh come to agreement on how this
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
might work in both
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
instances any discussion from the
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%

to we don't have to it doesn't go
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere okay yeah right this this stays
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
with the committee so it doesn't go to
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
the floor or anything so um we are now
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%

bill um Roman um one and excuse me uh
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
sections one and two on the first page

um relate to the EFA education service
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
provider advisory commission which is

currently in
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
statute um last year uh I believe it was
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
during during an EFA oversite uh
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
committee meeting um this commission
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
came under discussion um because it
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
turned out that well in current statute
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
um if anyone wants to look at it it it's
 
01:39:23.679 --> 01:39:25.390 align:start position:0%
um if anyone wants to look at it it it's
194

01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
194
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
F5 Roman 2 um um indicates that um the
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
meetings of this
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
commission um are not
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
mandated they are subject to the call of
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
the um director of the uh children's
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund who is the
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
administrator for the program um and at
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
that point um they did not um
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
have any meetings um because it was not
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
considered um that they were uh uh
 
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.910 align:start position:0%
considered um that they were uh uh
needed

01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
um there was also discussion about the
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
um the makeup of the committee and the
 
01:40:09.719 --> 01:40:11.430 align:start position:0%
um the makeup of the committee and the
membership

01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
membership
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
involved um so I I put this bill in U
 
01:40:17.589 --> 01:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
wanting to
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
address um those concerns that had come
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
up during the uh oversight committee
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
meeting so the first um part of it Roman
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
2 uh clarifies uh some things about the
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
membership of the um of the
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
committee um and uh includes that uh the
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
number of committee members that would
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
constitute a quorum because that had not
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
been in statute
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
previously um the second part of that en
 
01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:50.189 align:start position:0%
previously um the second part of that en
Roman

01:40:50.189 --> 01:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
three um requires that this commission
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
be uh uh convened on a quarterly basis
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
and more often if
 
01:41:01.679 --> 01:41:03.430 align:start position:0%
and more often if
necessary

01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
um and that uh the uh commission um had
 
01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
two UH
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um and that's in 3A and
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
B uh first was to uh re uh review any
 
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
appeals that education service providers
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
um who were denied uh admittance or um
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
were removed from the program um the
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
this commission would hear appeals of
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
those service
 
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
providers um and two uh to look at the
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh program application
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
process and also the uh approval process
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
for account
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
expenses and the approval of Education
 
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
service providers um those three things
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
um so that was in relation to the uh Pro
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
service provider advisory
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
commission the second part um which is
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh starts on uh line 24 on the first
 
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
page uh section
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
three uh adds two surveys that would be
 
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
required and these are um identical uh
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
um except entitle uh to surveys that
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
have been required for the past
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
decade um or so um with the uh tax
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program which was
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
initiated uh 12 years ago um and much of
 
01:42:45.149 --> 01:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
that information is available
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
online um in relation to those
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
surveys and the first survey um would be
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
a parental satisfaction
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
survey um many programs um of choice
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
around the nation uh do surveys like
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
this annually in terms of uh parental
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
satisfaction um and that is on uh Roman
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
1 on the second
 
01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.830 align:start position:0%
1 on the second
page

01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
um um part of that survey would be um
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
whether the parent is satisfied with
 
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
um their new education option and uh
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
also um if they have seen academic
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
Improvement um in in their child the
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
second survey would be uh in relation to
 
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh families who are actually moving
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh out of a public school into uh the
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
um and um basically uh asking um for uh
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
their reason for uh doing that um and if
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
they are paying additional expenses over
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
and above the education Freedom account
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
for their new service um Education
 
01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
for their new service um Education
Service

01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
Service
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
options um so those are the
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh two surveys and the uh
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
bill any comment from the
 
01:44:37.149 --> 01:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
second yes thank you madam chair
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I I think this bill addresses a lot
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
of um issues and questions people have
 
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
had about the EFA accounts and um given
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
the popularity of the program I think
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
that any information that may assist
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
strengthening Public Schools um would be
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
met with an immense amount of
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm um this survey is not to
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
point fingers at anyone but to find out
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
where the gaps or the holes may be and
 
01:45:07.629 --> 01:45:07.639 align:start position:0%
um you know provide that information
 
01:45:10.350 --> 01:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
along the line so the public schools may
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
want to address what what they've seen
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
on this and and um and an extra layer of
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
protection around programs that receive
 
01:45:20.189 --> 01:45:20.199 align:start position:0%
EFA money that may not live up to the
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
standard that we all need so I I I'm
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
strongly in favor of this bill and I
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
hope that all of my colleagues will
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
support us in this thank
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
you any other discussion representative
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you madam chair um I
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
personally be voting no on this the
 
01:45:40.589 --> 01:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
survey when it says that the it's an
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
impact survey I don't think it's going
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
to have any impact I could all your
 
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
people all you people that have efas
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
right now are going to answer yes and I
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't think I could give you the result
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
before anyone even takes the survey um
 
01:45:56.189 --> 01:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
so think the questions are
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
um they're not going to give us what we
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
want and if it's an I don't think it's
 
01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:03.639 align:start position:0%
going to show us gaps holes um and I
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to do
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
anything thank you representative
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
balbon thank you um first of all um this
 
01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
committee that's going to conduct uh the
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
survey uh these members are handpicked
 
01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
by the director of the scholarship Pro
 
01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
program and the only represent four
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
counties so there's no real oversight in
 
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
this committee per se because there's no
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
diverse membership which another U
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
committee that might be really looking
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
at the impact would you would include
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
maybe legislators members of the public
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
Educators as well as um people involved
 
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
in the EFA program um and uh to uh
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's point it only
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
measures parental satisfaction and the
 
01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
lead and these questions are very
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
leading and subjective and it provides
 
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
no objective actual achievement data on
 
01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
the students so I don't think this is
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
going to give you any good information
 
01:47:08.199 --> 01:47:10.870 align:start position:0%
going to give you any good information

all represent wock thank you mam chair R
 
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
Cordell just a clarification I may um on
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
the fir I'm on line uh nine and 10 of
 
01:47:23.159 --> 01:47:24.109 align:start position:0%
the fir I'm on line uh nine and 10 of
page

01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
two and I'm looking at the the uh first
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
question if I understand what you'd said
 
01:47:32.589 --> 01:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
that this is supposed to be the
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account parent
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
certification I mean satisfaction uh I'm
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
looking at uh line a and it talks about
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
program uh yes that um is uh an error
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to be
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
changed um from the as I said this was
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
taken out of the tax credit scholarship
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
program and that was to have been
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
changed okay but as it is I'm sorry
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
right as it is it isn't okay may may I
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
follow CH sure thank you um just a
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
follow other it's a question another
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
clarification question but it will
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
follow is there any more questions in
 
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
the survey Beyond these
 
01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:16.750 align:start position:0%
the survey Beyond these
three

01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
um the um uh as indicated in nine it
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
shall include these but I think it
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't restrict it to just those three
 
01:48:32.189 --> 01:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
questions this is may may I so do we
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
the uh uh this survey uh could well be
 
01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.149 align:start position:0%
the uh uh this survey uh could well be
uh

01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
expanded um um Beyond those three
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions and um I'm trying to remember
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
if the tax credit scholarship program
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
questions are expanded or not and but I
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
I cannot remember that for sure finally
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
matter chair I made just a concluding
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
comment I would agree with
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
representative Hall and Bon this is this
 
01:49:06.669 --> 01:49:06.679 align:start position:0%
makes Rosal look happy this is a
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
self-fulfilling prophecy you get the
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
answers before you send the survey out
 
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
there's no chance I have right answer
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray um thank
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
you Madame Vice chair um one point of
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
concern that I also have in addition to
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
the my other colleagues um is with with
 
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
regard to the fact that um sections one
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
and two um seem to indicate that maybe
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
the parent isn't being asked questions a
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
b and c and then it's broken out and it
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
says the survey shall include the
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
following question to the parent or
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
legal guardian so I'm I'm also concerned
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
and Confused it seems like all of these
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions would go to the entity who uh
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
holds or has some agency over the my
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
class wallet program so I'm confused as
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
to why uh in addition to the leading
 
01:49:56.109 --> 01:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
questions that I think what why it is
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
is Pur cordelli thank you uh yes uh uh
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
section one in relation to the advisory
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
commission is totally separate from the
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
survey um the surveys would not be aimed
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
commission I guess repr m uh with all
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
due respect I
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
I so the top three questions wouldn't be
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
too it seems like the top three
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions a b and c would be to a parent
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
and then question two the survey itself
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
should include the following question to
 
01:50:42.589 --> 01:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
well so
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
I are there two different sets of
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
surveys within I I guess that's what I'm
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
trying to understand right um I believe
 
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
in the tax credit uh scholarship program
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
um they are independent surveys I see
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
but and and and you said this was a an
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
scrier error with regard to the
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
education tax credit program that was
 
01:51:05.709 --> 01:51:05.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to say something else right ah
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
okay right yes um it it wasn't changed
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
um in the draft um but I would uh uh
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
submit a floor amendment to make that uh
 
01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:17.790 align:start position:0%
submit a floor amendment to make that uh
uh

01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
correction any other oh representative
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair um
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
I I I heard I heard um I Heard a comment
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
about how um all of the questions were
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
missleading and they really wouldn't
 
01:51:34.589 --> 01:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
address anything that the parents wanted
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
to do and I wanted to point out on page
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
one starting at line 26 the education
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
Freedom account impact survey shall be
 
01:51:43.709 --> 01:51:43.719 align:start position:0%
do a document developed by the
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and given to the
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
parents whose students who have exited a
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
public school Under the Pres provisions
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
of this chapter there survey shall
 
01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:55.719 align:start position:0%
solicit the reasons for seeking the
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account and any
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
suggested improvements desired in the
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
public school day or leaving so I do
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill passed with that
 
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me with that survey would be a
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism for public schools to see if
 
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
there's any holes or gaps that they may
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
able to be able to fix thank
 
01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.310 align:start position:0%
able to be able to fix thank
you

01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
represent if I may respond to the uh
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
uh identifying what she has spoke
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
about there's only 15% of the people
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
that ever left Public School 85% of the
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
people who are involved in this account
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
never attended a public school so how
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
you going to find all that small 15%
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
left in in representative
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
information I'm sorry and and thank you
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
and the ones have have already come back
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
um it's a small number but I the ones
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
that 85% never went there so this is a
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
really small survey for a really limited
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
piece of the answers you're going to
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
receive thank you madam chair may
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
I thank you and thank you representative
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
for the comment and while I agree 15% is
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
while I agree 15% is not a huge number
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
any information is good
 
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
information represent Murray thank you
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
madam Vice chair uh just to the the the
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
members point about misleading I just
 
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're on the same
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
page there was no assertation that it
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
was misleading we were saying the
 
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions were leading which I think is
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
a different set of circumstances leading
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions mean that they would arrive at
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
the same answer an expected answer not a
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
Mis we weren't there was no comment to
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
say that we were misleading
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
anything just one one other question I
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
just said and if you truly wanted to get
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
a survey I I would I would also include
 
01:53:52.159 --> 01:53:53.189 align:start position:0%
a survey I I would I would also include
um

01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:54.669 --> 01:53:54.679 align:start position:0%
questions given to the parents of
 
01:53:58.069 --> 01:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
students who took the were in the EA
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
program and then left and went back to
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
public school that might give you some
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
information any other
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
discussion representative dve thank you
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chairman I I don't think we're
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
Limited in what questions we can ask and
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think they need to be stipulated
 
01:54:22.069 --> 01:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
by Statute which are in there but those
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
that was good suggestion
 
01:54:26.669 --> 01:54:26.679 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
cig thank you um I just have in my notes
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
that there was going to be an amendment
 
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
pass so I'd been expect or brought
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
forward so I was questioning based on
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying accountability and other
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
things but if the chairman is going to
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
be bringing a floor amendment to address
 
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
what our technical errors perhaps it
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
might also expand the scope of the
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
survey in some way to include those who
 
01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
are never going to attend um Public
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
anyway any other
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative H thank you
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair I have a question just for
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
anyone so why does a survey have to be
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
survey okay um it uh does not um I had
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
actually talked to the skill children's
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund um about doing a
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
parental Sur uh satisfaction survey um
 
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
but um they had uh not as of the time
 
01:55:33.069 --> 01:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
that I filed this so I wanted to uh uh
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that it got done and it um
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't left a
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
voluntary um uh Choice um I wanted to
 
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
move it forward and make sure that it
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
happened uh so I included that in the
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
legislation um because I was already
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to submit the legislation about
 
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
the advis
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
you representative Woodcock last one um
 
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to follow up on repres comment
 
01:56:03.149 --> 01:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
I think it was and I want to go back to
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
my my fellow representative there from
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
the South Shore I think what is really
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
important is if we're if we're really
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
trying to find information I think she
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
has an excellent point which is let's
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
survey all of the people in the EFA I
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
would really like to know why the 85% of
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
those folks that took the EFA never
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
attended public school if we're really
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what's wrong with
 
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
public school and we have 85% of these
 
01:56:31.709 --> 01:56:31.719 align:start position:0%
people never stepped in the door I like
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
to find out why that would give us
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
things some credibility information if
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
it's just because they have they want to
 
01:56:38.109 --> 01:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
go a higher Academic Place and they have
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's fine but there must be other
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
reasons for people who aren't in that
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
same category that's what I like to know
 
01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
if we really intent on trying to use
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
this to improve public education for the
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
K12 we have there let's include everyone
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
I I I can support that I can't support
 
01:56:54.069 --> 01:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
this piece thank you representative
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you madam chair in
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
response to the previous comment I
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
Believe by representative Hall we do
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
have other surveys and law to put a
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
survey and law is in a novel concept
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
such as the euph foris behavior survey
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
ybs that we talk about quite
 
01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:12.430 align:start position:0%
ybs that we talk about quite
frequently

01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
question representative Murray thank you
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
madam Vice chair um the other the other
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
portion of this that I'm wondering about
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
is there is no opportunity with regard
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
to sort of missing set of demographics
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
that we were just talking about with
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative celik um I don't see
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
there being any opportunity for anything
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
other than like a few sort of
 
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
prescripted agree strongly disagree
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
there's no sort of um like short answer
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
area that I it seems to be again like a
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
very limited way to be able to respond
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions any other
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
discussion representative hul thank you
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh if I could comment in
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
reference to the survey the survey
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
itself is not in law right reference to
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
the survey the youth risk behavior
 
01:58:00.669 --> 01:58:00.679 align:start position:0%
survey just reference to it but the
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
actual survey is not into the law
 
01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.830 align:start position:0%
actual survey is not into the law
correct

01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
question and my understanding of the
 
01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us is this survey is
 
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
not in law it says other questions could
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
be added and those questions aren't in
 
01:58:18.910 --> 01:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%

um while representative C's gone maybe
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
we can all take a look and read um the
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
side by side that we just got uh for
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
house bill um 440 and 362 did everyone
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
get copies of those so we have a little
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
bit of time to take a look at
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
that guess I don't need this clerk thing
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
I can keep that pass that
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
down hang on look I have an abundance of
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
paper here yeah representative Woodcock
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
Northshore I'm not from the Southshore

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
session

02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.840 --> 02:02:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:50.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.840 --> 02:03:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:50.709 align:start position:0%

02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
I think we're
 
02:06:16.990 --> 02:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
quite here he

02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
um we have a side by side um comparing
 
02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%

02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
362 um which we talked about uh taking
 
02:06:42.549 --> 02:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
up this morning um there looks to
 
02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
be a slight difference in uh
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
362 which adds um a uh departmental
 
02:06:57.629 --> 02:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
waiver um to the language which is not
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
in 440 uh 440 we did pass the other
 
02:07:02.079 --> 02:07:03.950 align:start position:0%
in 440 uh 440 we did pass the other
day

02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:07:07.229 --> 02:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
um and correct me if I'm wrong um when
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 440 did someone um
 
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
say and I don't
 
02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.709 align:start position:0%

he said
 
02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
440 aligned with the rules that's
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's okay I contacted Jeff
 
02:07:46.350 --> 02:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
beard The Who heads theard I'm sorry yes
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
just bearded from um CTE and he said
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
that 440 align with the rules and so he
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
just didn't I don't think he preferred
 
02:07:58.510 --> 02:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
but he just said that would aligned best
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
rules um yeah represent of Paul yeah
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
just so this side by side actually
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday we amended it to have initial
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
added that word initial to this on the
 
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
left hand side 440 just letting you know
 
02:08:22.669 --> 02:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
that the word initial is there
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
oh right
 
02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:32.229 align:start position:0%
oh right
yes

02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
right F the comments um I'll just
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
mention that um uh I did uh I had been
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
in contact with uh um Mr applebe from
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
the Department in relation to
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
362 and uh he was comfortable with the
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
language in 362
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
um so um I have messaged him that U
 
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
maybe he can talk with Mr
 
02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
beard and um come to an agreement as to
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
um whether the uh departmental waiver um
 
02:09:12.510 --> 02:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
require mentioned in
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
362 um should be part of um whatever we
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
pass um so maybe we can um hold off um
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
on 362 until we get departmental
 
02:09:32.549 --> 02:09:32.559 align:start position:0%
agreement on um on the
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
language represent Marie I have question
 
02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
sure well no might as well go ahead um
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
so one question that I did have was
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
there were two small sections on 362
 
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
which talk about the Schoolboard
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
submitting a waiver and then the
 
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
department then having the authority to
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
submit a waiver and I wondered which
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
entity was reached could respond first
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
or could that be put
 
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
in could the local school board deny a
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
waiver and then the department accept a
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
waiver and then vice versa could it put
 
02:10:09.709 --> 02:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
be put in conflict with one another
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
yeah this how we going to take no action
 
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe I'm interpreting it incorrect
 
02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
it just seems like there's two different
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
ways that a waiver can be brought
 
02:10:30.510 --> 02:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
forward I guess is what I was trying to
 
02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:31.910 align:start position:0%
forward I guess is what I was trying to
say

02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
right um okay why don't we um hold off
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
on this then
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
um forther comment yeah thanks clearly
 
02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
um CL if we go with the 362 piece so
 
02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
then is initial going to be put in there
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
we talked about the word initial uh
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday for 440 if we if we go with
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
overlaying overlapping 362 could we be
 
02:11:02.350 --> 02:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
sure the initial is in
 
02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:03.950 align:start position:0%
sure the initial is in
there

02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
um right uh you on the first line
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
see be an
 
02:11:10.079 --> 02:11:14.109 align:start position:0%
see be an
initial

02:11:14.109 --> 02:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
an okay is the question you may know
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
this because I don't if I may follow
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
up right can't
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
can't the department already do
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
that for any any allw waiver for they
 
02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:32.310 align:start position:0%
that for any any allw waiver for they
want

02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.109 --> 02:11:36.119 align:start position:0%
um allowing for waivers I thought that
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
the commissioner could um probably um in
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
rules but if it's in rules it should
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
have a statutory
 
02:11:48.270 --> 02:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
reference um so we uh if they can we
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
don't need the end part that's all right
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we'll we'll um raise that with
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
the Department okay thank you yeah just
 
02:11:59.069 --> 02:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
a procedural question um if we if we
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
already passed the first one right what
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
would happen next if we chose this one
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
if we decide this one was better it's
 
02:12:11.069 --> 02:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
the uh if they're uh
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
conflicting um I know when it applies to
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
statutes if they are conflicting
 
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
statutes um it's the one that passed
 
02:12:20.079 --> 02:12:22.430 align:start position:0%
statutes um it's the one that passed
last

02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:12:27.149 --> 02:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
that that uh is referred to
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
right so I I um I'm not I would assume
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
that the same would hold to uh uh to
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:47.589 align:start position:0%
 
any

02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
right this the speaker could just put in
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
when he got on the floor he could just
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
kill one on the
 
02:13:09.629 --> 02:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
um right we we could um if some of the
 
02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
language of
 
02:13:21.629 --> 02:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
362 um is um
 
02:13:25.310 --> 02:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
preferred to 440 what we could also do
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
is um we've already passed 440 um we
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
could um uh go to the Senate and ask
 
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
them to uh amend the bill in the amend
 
02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 440 in the Senate uh to
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
include requested language from the
 
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
Department that would be another option
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
would could could it be an OP I'm
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
no oh
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay right okay right that we just we
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
yes right could you repr repeat what you
 
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
said so um 440 hasn't been sent over um
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay right so it it's still our bill so
 
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
we can do whatever we want with 440
 
02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
we can do whatever we want with 440
still

02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
Yes represent Murray and then
 
02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
additionally if both were to somehow
 
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
leave this committee and enter the floor
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
there was always a possibility that one
 
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
or the other could come back to this
 
02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee correct and be sent back to
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
the committee we referred essentially
 
02:14:48.669 --> 02:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
yes or you can kill one on the floor yes
 
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah we we have we have a bunch of
 
02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:54.470 align:start position:0%
right yeah we we have we have a bunch of
options

02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent s thank you Mr chair just
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
procedurally in my previous committee we
 
02:15:01.030 --> 02:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
had uh and representative tzar may
 
02:15:03.310 --> 02:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
remember this we had a similar situation
 
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
where we had a few different bills that
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
were fairly similar in our first year
 
02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
which we we retained a couple of them so
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
that should one have difficulty making
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
it through the full process we had it to
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
amend and adapt so that we could submit
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
it during the second year so I just
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to offer that that was also a
 
02:15:24.069 --> 02:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
possibility that's a good point yes
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
we've done that in education in uh a
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
number of instances yes I I think the
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
CTE centers are anxious for something
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
like this to happen because they're
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
having a hard
 
02:15:38.669 --> 02:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
time oh okay okay they're looking
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
forward to this yeah um so uh um we will
 
02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
hold on to um maybe 440 in our position
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
if we can possession um until we clar
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.790 align:start position:0%
 
Department

02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:00.510 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
right representative Mor representative
 
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
Morse thank you uh so similar to what
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned about kind of retaining it
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
in case one fails the other one can kind
 
02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
of pass my other question would be about
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
kind of consolidating them together and
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
doing like a Flor amendment that has
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
everything combined right or or since we
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
have 440
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
still in our possession we can just
 
02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:24.750 align:start position:0%
still in our possession we can just
amend

02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
amend
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
440 or um after a reconsideration of
 
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
that right so yeah we would only need
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
one one of them so yeah as soon as I get
 
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
clarification from the Department uh we
 
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
can move forward in one of these
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
directions follow up yes so I guess that
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
begs a question of combining them and
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
then holding the other one as a retain
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
just in
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
not yet let's wait and see what the
 
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
department has to say um you know they
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
could say you know just go with 440 and
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
it's okay and then you know we'll be
 
02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be
 
02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:10.549 align:start position:0%
we'll be
set

02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
set
 
02:17:10.559 --> 02:17:12.429 align:start position:0%
set
um

02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
okay um so we'll hold on that until we
 
02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:18.270 align:start position:0%
okay um so we'll hold on that until we
get

02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
clarification um I wanted to bring up
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
one additional
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
02:17:32.190 --> 02:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
today which is uh House Bill 384 on uh
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
bullying um we had a work
 
02:17:39.309 --> 02:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
session um yesterday on the three uh
 
02:17:39.319 --> 02:17:40.509 align:start position:0%
session um yesterday on the three uh
bullying

02:17:40.509 --> 02:17:40.519 align:start position:0%
bullying
 
02:17:40.519 --> 02:17:42.509 align:start position:0%
bullying
bills

02:17:42.509 --> 02:17:42.519 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
um and um this is an early Bill
 
02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
384 um I I think that there were um
 
02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
comments during the work
 
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.190 align:start position:0%
comments during the work
session

02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
with several um concerns people had um
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
with this um bill in relation to the
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
referrals um to for
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
chins um also the required uh conflict
 
02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
resolution um Provisions in it was
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
um uh was felt not be appropriate maybe
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases especially in um uh
 
02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:27.549 align:start position:0%
in some cases especially in um uh
Elementary

02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
Elementary
 
02:18:32.349 --> 02:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
grades um I I think that um as we move
 
02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
forward with the two non early bullying
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
bills um if there are ideas from this um
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
they could be incorporated into whatever
 
02:18:48.429 --> 02:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
bullying Bill we move forward
 
02:18:54.509 --> 02:18:54.519 align:start position:0%
with um so um my recommendation is that
 
02:18:58.030 --> 02:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.040 --> 02:18:59.549 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:18:59.549 --> 02:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:04.270 --> 02:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
um uh do not move forward with 384 and I
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
would be willing to make a motion um but
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to hear some discussion
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
before any mo motion is put forward on
 
02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:16.309 align:start position:0%
before any mo motion is put forward on
this

02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill rent Cornell Thank you Mr chair um
 
02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
and I agree with what you said I I think
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
the the chin petition and the conflict
 
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
resolution and also the bullying officer
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
was a big question um of who that was
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
going to be what training they were
 
02:19:35.429 --> 02:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
going to have how that was going to help
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
um so I I just there were good parts to
 
02:19:40.750 --> 02:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
it but I think on the whole I I would
 
02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
agree with you that that this at this
 
02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
bill parts of it could be incorporated
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
into the other two that I think we're
 
02:19:52.750 --> 02:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.469 --> 02:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
represent Morris I can agree with that
 
02:19:58.429 --> 02:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
as well also it kind of this bill goes
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
above its own authority on lines 15
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
through 25 requiring parental classes
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
for the parents of those accused and I
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of government
 
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
overreach and we can't really mandate
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
things like that thank you any
 
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion before we actually uh
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
see none um do you want to take the G
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
make the motion okay great um
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
right um okay I recognize um uh Vice
 
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Noble for a motion on House
 
02:20:38.429 --> 02:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
Bill 384 prohibiting bullying in schools
 
02:20:39.790 --> 02:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
I move
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
itl thank you is there a second I'll
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
would the the maker of the motion like
 
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
to discuss her itl motion I think
 
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
everybody else already discussed it so
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
good R Morris no good any further
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.309 --> 02:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
committee everyone wants in few minutes
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%

problems um while I have no data to

support or contract contradict this
 
03:38:06.229 --> 03:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
information I would say from my
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
experience for some of our children yes
 
03:38:10.590 --> 03:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
they do have some of the more difficult
 
03:38:13.030 --> 03:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
behaviors that can result in
 
03:38:15.790 --> 03:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
disciplinary removals speaking of kids
 
03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
disciplinary removals speaking of kids
with

03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities many times these behaviors
 
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
are due to their disabilities and
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
disminucion of the afternoon which is
 
03:38:48.710 --> 03:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:38:52.950 --> 03:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
653 establishing a pilot program within
 
03:38:55.469 --> 03:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to implement
 
03:38:57.630 --> 03:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
alternatives to restraint and seclusion
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
of students and uh we
 
03:39:02.750 --> 03:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
welcome uh the prime sponsor

patrio well thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
03:39:09.830 --> 03:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
the record I'm representative Peter
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
patrino from the town of Milford and the
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislation before you originated as a
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
result of an inm study which I chaired
 
03:39:19.710 --> 03:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
this past summer in response to House
 
03:39:22.590 --> 03:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 1269 which came before the children
 
03:39:25.950 --> 03:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
and family law committee last year and
 
03:39:29.550 --> 03:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
that bill called for visual and auditory
 
03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
recordings in each uh use of restraint
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
and seclusion if included in the
 
03:39:37.229 --> 03:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
students IEP now a number of parents
 
03:39:40.389 --> 03:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
testified in support of the bill some
 
03:39:42.469 --> 03:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
sharing disturbing photos of their
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
children with bruis marks and injuries
 
03:39:48.349 --> 03:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
and alleging abuse and neglect on the
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
part of the school staff now since
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
students with IEPs are mainstreamed the
 
03:39:54.750 --> 03:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
committee felt that the bill would
 
03:39:56.429 --> 03:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
require security cameras in every
 
03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
classroom throughout the state and even
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
at one point during the inm study it was
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
suggested that teachers wear body
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
cameras like like the
 
03:40:05.950 --> 03:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
police so the majority felt that these
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
measures were impractical and to say the
 
03:40:11.229 --> 03:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
least extremely costly but the testimony
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
given by the parents was
 
03:40:16.349 --> 03:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
heartfelt and I personally believe that
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
it would be very inappropriate for us to
 
03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
Simply itl the bill without giving any
 
03:40:23.790 --> 03:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
due concern for the parents uh who
 
03:40:26.510 --> 03:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
testified so what we did was we formed
 
03:40:29.150 --> 03:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
an interim study and what we discovered
 
03:40:31.469 --> 03:40:31.479 align:start position:0%
was that there are alternative methods
 
03:40:33.309 --> 03:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
that appear promising in reducing the
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
need for restraint and seclusion uh we
 
03:40:37.389 --> 03:40:37.399 align:start position:0%
looked into the approach developed by Dr
 
03:40:39.150 --> 03:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
Ross Green the director of lies and the
 
03:40:41.550 --> 03:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
balance we heard testimony from Toby
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
Iselin who's the co-director of the wio
 
03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
school in Hillsboro who reported
 
03:40:47.910 --> 03:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
positive results uh from their
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
alternative approaches and we also
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
examined the reforms made by the state
 
03:40:56.189 --> 03:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
of Maine in this regard which has
 
03:40:58.710 --> 03:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that current methods are
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
not effective in altering students
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
behavior but instead can be traumatizing
 
03:41:06.990 --> 03:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
and cause lasting negative effects now
 
03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
Maine acknowledges that restraint and
 
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
seclusion should only be used in
 
03:41:13.990 --> 03:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
emergency situations when a child's
 
03:41:16.510 --> 03:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
Behavior creates an UNS safe condition
 
03:41:19.389 --> 03:41:19.399 align:start position:0%
but that alternative methods need to be
 
03:41:23.110 --> 03:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
employed to reduce such instances so if
 
03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
you look at the Maine Department of
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
education's website they say we do know
 
03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
that there are best practice proactive
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
Crisis Prevention methodologies that can
 
03:41:34.319 --> 03:41:35.269 align:start position:0%
Crisis Prevention methodologies that can
be

03:41:35.269 --> 03:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:41:38.149 --> 03:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
implemented so the result of our work is
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
this legislation which we are calling
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
the safe schools pilot project within
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education um it's
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
purpose is exploratory not for us to
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
implement any one program but to Pilot
 
03:41:52.870 --> 03:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
approved trauma-based informed practices
 
03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
in schools uh which wish to participate
 
03:41:58.830 --> 03:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh the full details of inflation are
 
03:42:01.630 --> 03:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
given within the bill so lastly I would
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
just like to thank Senator MCU for
 
03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
filing uh his initial bill last year uh
 
03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
he had good intentions and I would also
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
like to thank the office of the child
 
03:42:13.030 --> 03:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
advocate for their assistance in helping
 
03:42:15.630 --> 03:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
us throughout the interim study and for
 
03:42:17.910 --> 03:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
helping us draft this legislation thank
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman happy to take any
 
03:42:23.349 --> 03:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh represent
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:42:27.309 --> 03:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
representative patuna for taking my
 
03:42:30.750 --> 03:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
question one uh within the definition of
 
03:42:32.750 --> 03:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
the word seclusion I understand when
 
03:42:35.469 --> 03:42:35.479 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um alternatives to
 
03:42:38.910 --> 03:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
restraint would seclusion um be purely
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
defined in a a disciplinary setting or
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
if a child for example is over
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
stimulated and need to um self- relocate
 
03:42:50.269 --> 03:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
or do something else would that qualify
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
as seclusion seclusion means exactly
 
03:42:55.030 --> 03:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
what it means it is removing the child
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
from uh the situation and putting them
 
03:43:01.229 --> 03:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
in some type of isolation and on a
 
03:43:02.910 --> 03:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
personal note I can tell you that I
 
03:43:04.149 --> 03:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
experienced it when I was in
 
03:43:06.189 --> 03:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
kindergarten all right when I was doing
 
03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
something that my teachers felt were
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
just inappropriate and to be honest with
 
03:43:12.070 --> 03:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
you I thought I was a pretty good kid
 
03:43:13.830 --> 03:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
all right and there were times when they
 
03:43:15.269 --> 03:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
would put me in the closet and close CL
 
03:43:17.830 --> 03:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
the door and I was wondering like why
 
03:43:19.469 --> 03:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
but apparently whatever I was doing
 
03:43:21.189 --> 03:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't pleasing to them so yeah
 
03:43:23.070 --> 03:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
seclusion means literally removing
 
03:43:25.070 --> 03:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
somebody and putting them in
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
isolation I gu follow follow yes my
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not if if this
 
03:43:33.070 --> 03:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
definition I understand what you're
 
03:43:35.950 --> 03:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
saying with regard to a punitive sort of
 
03:43:40.110 --> 03:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
removal I'm talking about if a child is
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
removing themselves out of an
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
environment where they're over
 
03:43:44.710 --> 03:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
stimulated would that be considered I
 
03:43:46.269 --> 03:43:46.279 align:start position:0%
see self if it's
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
self-imposed if it's self-imposed you're
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
asking I don't believe so thank
 
03:43:52.880 --> 03:43:54.469 align:start position:0%
asking I don't believe so thank
you

03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
further questions of the
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor um I just have one
 
03:44:05.149 --> 03:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
um um on um Roman
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
1B um it talks about the purposes of the
 
03:44:12.510 --> 03:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
pilot um so the
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
programs um that are to be used
 
03:44:20.070 --> 03:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
in the um restraint and seclusion
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
pilot um are defined in lines 9 through
 
03:44:28.110 --> 03:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
11 is is that
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
correct um where it talks about U
 
03:44:34.590 --> 03:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh programs provided by a
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
national Clearing House and it gave um
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
an example so programs from um that
 
03:44:46.910 --> 03:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
clearing house um are to be used by
 
03:44:51.870 --> 03:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
these pilot schools for the pilot study
 
03:44:55.950 --> 03:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay thank you rent
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
salik thank you so much and thank you
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my my question um and again
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
congratulations on having one of your
 
03:45:04.229 --> 03:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
former students give you a shout out
 
03:45:06.429 --> 03:45:06.439 align:start position:0%
last week during testimony but thank you
 
03:45:12.030 --> 03:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
in um on page one line 15 and 16 um it
 
03:45:14.149 --> 03:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
says evidence-based alternatives to
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
restraint and cusion shall not include
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
programs that use restraint for
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
seclusion that makes sense but Crisis
 
03:45:22.990 --> 03:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
Prevention training which I sort of
 
03:45:24.670 --> 03:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
understand but deescalation training or
 
03:45:26.950 --> 03:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
behav management training I'm curious
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't use something that
 
03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
involves deescalation training right um
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm just trying to get
 
03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
clarification on that portion of the
 
03:45:39.189 --> 03:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
bill exactly what we're looking at are
 
03:45:41.189 --> 03:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
alternatives to what is currently being
 
03:45:43.149 --> 03:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
used because we're acknowledging that
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
current practices aren't working and so
 
03:45:47.149 --> 03:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
we do want to look at
 
03:45:50.670 --> 03:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and and that is why you
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
have a study program to basically look
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
to implement ways other than what we are
 
03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
currently using so we are currently
 
03:46:00.630 --> 03:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
using uh deescalation but we're
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that U it's not always
 
03:46:05.309 --> 03:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
working so we're looking for other ways
 
03:46:09.510 --> 03:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
better represent thank you Mr chair and
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for bringing
 
03:46:17.229 --> 03:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
this forward I'm looking at page one
 
03:46:17.239 --> 03:46:18.469 align:start position:0%
this forward I'm looking at page one
line

03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:46:21.229 --> 03:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
24 and it mentions two schools with the
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
highest per capita incidents of
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
restraints and inclusion is that a
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
highest group of per capita or I guess
 
03:46:31.710 --> 03:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
my question is how could there be two
 
03:46:33.189 --> 03:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
schools that are the highest wouldn't
 
03:46:35.349 --> 03:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
there only be one school that's the
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
definitive highest okay I hear what
 
03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
you're saying but I mean I think the
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
intent is to look at schools that have
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
the highest percentage of these
 
03:46:46.149 --> 03:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
incidences uh reped and to have at least
 
03:46:49.990 --> 03:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
two of them okay thank you that's
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
correct represent
 
03:46:54.990 --> 03:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:47:00.030 --> 03:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious
 
03:47:02.830 --> 03:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm curious about the piece
 
03:47:05.950 --> 03:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
around this being
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
um an alternative to restraint and
 
03:47:12.910 --> 03:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
seclusion and not being able to use
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
it alongside Crisis Prevention
 
03:47:18.149 --> 03:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
deescalation or behavior
 
03:47:21.070 --> 03:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
management um I think and maybe you can
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
answer this for me is there any reason
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
why you wouldn't want to use this as
 
03:47:28.630 --> 03:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
well as those other modalities in order
 
03:47:34.229 --> 03:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
to address a reduction in um restraints
 
03:47:37.309 --> 03:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
yes and again um current methods that we
 
03:47:39.309 --> 03:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
are using don't seem to be effective I
 
03:47:41.149 --> 03:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
hear exactly what you're saying but what
 
03:47:42.910 --> 03:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is to look at
 
03:47:44.630 --> 03:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
alternatives to what currently is being
 
03:47:46.870 --> 03:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
used used and we can f we can look to
 
03:47:49.510 --> 03:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine that has basically
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
outlawed uh restraint and seclusion and
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
has acknowledge that it should only be
 
03:47:57.269 --> 03:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
used in instances when uh there's issues
 
03:47:59.830 --> 03:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
of safety that are concerned and so
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
Maine is looking at these alternative
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
methods which is what we would like to
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
explore we want to see if they are being
 
03:48:07.870 --> 03:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
successful and if we can Implement a
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
pilot program and see if it's something
 
03:48:12.510 --> 03:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
that we in New Hampshire should
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
incorporate so basically to have
 
03:48:16.910 --> 03:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
everything at our disposal to reduce
 
03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
those situations when we heard testimony
 
03:48:20.429 --> 03:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
from those parents and we saw
 
03:48:22.590 --> 03:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
photographs of children who were bruised
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
and injured like I said we got to find a
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
better way so as we're looking for A
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
Better Way We Came Upon Alternatives
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
that seem to be working but we don't
 
03:48:34.550 --> 03:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
know for sure if they are working until
 
03:48:36.110 --> 03:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
we have a pilot program and test them
 
03:48:38.110 --> 03:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
out we can look to Maine and take a look
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
at some of the data there it is
 
03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
promising can I have a followup Mr yes
 
03:48:44.950 --> 03:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
you may thank you and thank you for that
 
03:48:48.750 --> 03:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
um I I I will tell I will tell you what
 
03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
my concern with this is and then I will
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
ask you a question um my now adult son
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
is on the Spectrum and when he was in
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
the second grade he had a lot of
 
03:49:01.790 --> 03:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
behavior issues and he was a big kid and
 
03:49:03.550 --> 03:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
physically he would lash out
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
occasionally now if we hadn't used any
 
03:49:08.429 --> 03:49:08.439 align:start position:0%
of these
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
techniques that are currently available
 
03:49:14.149 --> 03:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think we would have been able to
 
03:49:14.159 --> 03:49:15.389 align:start position:0%
I don't think we would have been able to
address

03:49:15.389 --> 03:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:49:15.399 --> 03:49:16.710 align:start position:0%
address
his

03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
his
 
03:49:19.870 --> 03:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
meltdowns and with deescalation so my
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
concern would be taking these programs
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
out strictly for one program um and I I
 
03:49:29.189 --> 03:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
I do hear what you're saying about a p
 
03:49:31.630 --> 03:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
pilot program do you have any numbers
 
03:49:35.070 --> 03:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
from Maine any percentages any cases
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
that would make me feel more comfortable
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
about implementing Justice and no other
 
03:49:43.349 --> 03:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
of these modalities sure well the state
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
of Maine on the department of ucation
 
03:49:48.389 --> 03:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
website details what they're doing there
 
03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh so that's one place that you can look
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
as far as data I don't know uh
 
03:49:54.510 --> 03:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
specifically uh what they are reporting
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
in that regard uh but I do hear what
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying um my wife who was a first
 
03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
grade teacher for many years is 5 foot
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
tall and she has told me some of her
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
first graders were as tall if not bigger
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
than her okay and so I've heard this
 
03:50:11.389 --> 03:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
same situation at home um but again um
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
those types of modalities uh need to be
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
used in situations where things escalate
 
03:50:19.469 --> 03:50:19.479 align:start position:0%
to the point where they become dangerous
 
03:50:21.990 --> 03:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
so they're not being excluded uh even in
 
03:50:23.790 --> 03:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine they acknowledge that
 
03:50:25.710 --> 03:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
yes there are times when these methods
 
03:50:27.750 --> 03:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
need to be used but we want to minimize
 
03:50:29.830 --> 03:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
it and look for something different that
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
maybe can prevent it from happening in
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
the first place thank you represent
 
03:50:37.790 --> 03:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
Morris uh thank you Mr chair I just had
 
03:50:39.309 --> 03:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
a question as to what some of these
 
03:50:42.550 --> 03:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
Alternatives might look like well again
 
03:50:44.309 --> 03:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and I and
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
and I believe that uh there are a few
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
that I um alluded to in my presentation
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
and um you can again uh look at the
 
03:50:54.389 --> 03:50:54.399 align:start position:0%
department of education's website in
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
detail s thank you so much this is just
 
03:51:05.910 --> 03:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
a technical question about the
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
composition of the bill itself on page
 
03:51:15.389 --> 03:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
two um I see Roman 3 a b c e but not D
 
03:51:18.070 --> 03:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if I'm missing D
 
03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere or if it's been misplaced
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I'm just trying to mix
 
03:51:29.149 --> 03:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 a b c 1 2 3 4 5 C then
 
03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
down to D then we begin ran numeral
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
three I don't where do you see D I don't
 
03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
have D on mine and it's right it jumps
 
03:51:41.309 --> 03:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
to line e on line 23 on page two but I
 
03:51:45.309 --> 03:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
have C and then I have E I don't have d
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
right I think are are we missing is it
 
03:51:50.110 --> 03:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
me or are we missing
 
03:51:54.950 --> 03:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
D could be um yeah probably a typo and
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
alls okay I just I just want to make
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
sure I hadn't yeah no you didn't didn't
 
03:52:02.830 --> 03:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
miss anything
 
03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you or unless we both
 
03:52:09.790 --> 03:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
did you should be any further uh
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
comments thank you very much I
 
03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate it yeah thank you very much
 
03:52:16.349 --> 03:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman one more question
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh Mr chair um it did say
 
03:52:20.910 --> 03:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
that we were still awaiting a fiscal
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
note did you have an updated fiscal note
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:30.870 --> 03:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
that half
 
03:52:33.870 --> 03:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
million okay somehow my my copy didn't
 
03:52:40.830 --> 03:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:40.840 --> 03:52:42.630 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:52:42.630 --> 03:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:52.990 --> 03:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
right there there is
 
03:52:55.349 --> 03:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
um a fiscal
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
note um that was revised on January 24th
 
03:52:59.880 --> 03:53:04.710 align:start position:0%
note um that was revised on January 24th
looks

03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to the education policy
 
03:53:22.750 --> 03:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee Senator thank Mr chairman nice
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
to see you
 
03:53:26.429 --> 03:53:26.439 align:start position:0%
all this bill is this topic has come
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
back to a different committee so I'll
 
03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
just give a little bit of background I
 
03:53:30.590 --> 03:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of prepared testimony
 
03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
and I just indicated one minute but I
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
might take a little bit longer given
 
03:53:36.550 --> 03:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that came up my
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
name is Senator Tim mugh I represent
 
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
District 11 which are the towns of marac
 
03:53:43.950 --> 03:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
Milford hemmer and Wilton and this bill
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
came from from a group of constituents
 
03:53:49.469 --> 03:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
in marac that brought brought the
 
03:53:52.269 --> 03:53:52.279 align:start position:0%
legislators together and told us
 
03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
shockingly that hundreds if not
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of students are
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
restrained in our schools using padded
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
rooms and other means every year every
 
03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
reporting period and this was a foreign
 
03:54:09.189 --> 03:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
topic to me couldn't imagine a school
 
03:54:12.429 --> 03:54:12.439 align:start position:0%
with a padded room I imagine many of you
 
03:54:15.110 --> 03:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
are my age are similar
 
03:54:16.750 --> 03:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
also might have been a little bit
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
shocked to know that almost every school
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
has a restraint room restraint or
 
03:54:21.760 --> 03:54:22.710 align:start position:0%
has a restraint room restraint or
seclusion

03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
seclusion
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
room um it was pretty pretty shocking
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
actually to hear the numbers 1,400 1500
 
03:54:30.870 --> 03:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the reporting period and some
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
of the schools were uh hundreds a year
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
and then we dived into the details to
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
understand why and what types of
 
03:54:40.510 --> 03:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
students and what types of incidents
 
03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
were involved and the original request
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
was to uh audio and video record these
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
practices so we could better understand
 
03:54:52.590 --> 03:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
why and safety and and as you could
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
imagine that um Unleashed a whole
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
Pandora's box of discussion you know
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns for teachers and
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
students and all kinds of things uh and
 
03:55:06.189 --> 03:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
that led to the bill being heavily
 
03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
discussed over the summer uh in uh I
 
03:55:11.269 --> 03:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
think it was retained and re-referred
 
03:55:13.710 --> 03:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
and some great work done by the sponsors
 
03:55:14.910 --> 03:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
who uh
 
03:55:17.950 --> 03:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
graciously brought it back uh this this
 
03:55:21.870 --> 03:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
time uh this session uh in in this form
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I guess the bottom line for me is
 
03:55:27.070 --> 03:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
there are too many students being
 
03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:28.750 align:start position:0%
there are too many students being
restrained

03:55:28.750 --> 03:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
restrained
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
forcefully um in general so whatever we
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
can do and whatever this committee can
 
03:55:36.269 --> 03:55:36.279 align:start position:0%
do and I'll help when it makes it to the
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
other body whatever we can do to reduce
 
03:55:41.469 --> 03:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
that number is a good thing and I don't
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
know that this particular language is
 
03:55:46.510 --> 03:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
exact ly correct we've had some great
 
03:55:49.590 --> 03:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for those already um
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
about you know what exactly what is the
 
03:55:52.990 --> 03:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that we're basing these
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
practices on what are the current
 
03:55:56.349 --> 03:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
practices uh you know what will the
 
03:55:59.110 --> 03:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
pilot mean uh you know what are the two
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
highest I think it means you know the
 
03:56:02.229 --> 03:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
top two on the list right and I can
 
03:56:03.630 --> 03:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
probably tell you and there's some folks
 
03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
behind me who will give you the exact
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
numbers I have some in my head but I'm
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
sure they've changed the numbers have
 
03:56:11.070 --> 03:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
been updated annually so of the list of
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
the the 10 schools with the most
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
incident of documented restraint and
 
03:56:19.229 --> 03:56:19.239 align:start position:0%
seclusion um will'll take the top two I
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
think that's the intent right you know
 
03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
the top two on that list that's what
 
03:56:25.510 --> 03:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
they mean by the two highest um you know
 
03:56:29.710 --> 03:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
what are some of the alternate means and
 
03:56:33.070 --> 03:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
why would we uh in in line 15 am I just
 
03:56:36.429 --> 03:56:36.439 align:start position:0%
need my glasses here in line 15 uh you
 
03:56:38.910 --> 03:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
know why would we want to
 
03:56:41.309 --> 03:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
exclude um
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
methods that we're already doing well
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
why would we fund a uh pilot to do the
 
03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
same things and also but I'll get to the
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
funding in a second um why would we want
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
why would we want to try something that
 
03:56:54.790 --> 03:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're already doing so this pilot
 
03:56:59.550 --> 03:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't intend to examine those same
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
practices where we already have some
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
data so we want to try some new things
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
things like positive behavioral support
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
timeouts teaching replacement skills
 
03:57:11.990 --> 03:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
those are some of the things where there
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
are evidence from other states and other
 
03:57:16.030 --> 03:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
teaching and I don't
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily um think that the California
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
based evidence Clearing House for child
 
03:57:22.110 --> 03:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
welfare is
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily where we want to look it
 
03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
just happens to be one that's being
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
current currently used and there's a
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
body of work on it um
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
so the the pilot and the legislature
 
03:57:39.870 --> 03:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
should look at all all all Alternatives
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps this committee may choose
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
either in subcommittee or a committee of
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
the whole uh to revise or clean up that
 
03:57:47.910 --> 03:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
language and make it either um either
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
more specific or perhaps a little more
 
03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
broad uh to give the educational
 
03:57:54.990 --> 03:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
institutions a bit a bit of Freedom uh
 
03:57:57.469 --> 03:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
to use a variety of evidence-based
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
programs so for me as a clinical
 
03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
researcher uh you know peer-reviewed
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
published data in uh high level journals
 
03:58:06.830 --> 03:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
is is the standard that I tend to tend
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
to apply I mean randomized Control Data
 
03:58:10.830 --> 03:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
randomized control trials are great I'm
 
03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
not sure that applies in the educational
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
world so anyhow so that's where I am uh
 
03:58:17.550 --> 03:58:17.560 align:start position:0%
fewer incidents of restraint fewer
 
03:58:20.510 --> 03:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
incidents of seclusion are better uh in
 
03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
my opinion um deescalation is always
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
good I think our our teachers are are
 
03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
trained to do that um happy to answer
 
03:58:30.510 --> 03:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions and there are experts behind
 
03:58:33.429 --> 03:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
me that can answer I think in detail on
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
the specific practice itself I know
 
03:58:37.349 --> 03:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
there are some experts on the committee
 
03:58:39.870 --> 03:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
on that um but I'm happy to answer
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
questions hopefully that a little bit of
 
03:58:44.309 --> 03:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
color on how we got to this point and
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
why this bill is back in a different
 
03:58:47.710 --> 03:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
very different
 
03:58:50.910 --> 03:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
form um thank you very much uh questions
 
03:58:54.550 --> 03:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
for the senator r s thank you so much
 
03:58:56.149 --> 03:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question you
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
you made reference at the beginning of
 
03:58:59.469 --> 03:58:59.479 align:start position:0%
your testimony you might have comments
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
about the fiscal note and I just
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
wondered if you might follow up on that
 
03:59:05.550 --> 03:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
I did and I didn't thank
 
03:59:07.830 --> 03:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
you um I I did notice there was no
 
03:59:10.469 --> 03:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation attached which I suppose
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
is convenient in a budget year um and uh
 
03:59:17.349 --> 03:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
and and I don't think we know exactly
 
03:59:21.070 --> 03:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
what it'll cost um if I suppose there'll
 
03:59:23.510 --> 03:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
be some cost I'm not sure I agree with
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
the indeterminate cost or the need to
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
hire a new person to administer this
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
program um I it's I think it's naturally
 
03:59:36.790 --> 03:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
the tendency of the department to say
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
yes we need another body and see what
 
03:59:43.630 --> 03:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
happens um I can tell you well in my in
 
03:59:45.550 --> 03:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
this senator's opinion it's highly
 
03:59:48.910 --> 03:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
unlikely that they would get one
 
03:59:52.870 --> 03:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
um who can say really until we get to
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
the passage of the the trailer bill of
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and that's a long way from
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
today um so I do I think it will need
 
04:00:05.630 --> 04:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
some funding yes do I think it's worth
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
it absolutely yeah I I I do where it's
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:00:14.550 --> 04:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
land you the house will have to let the
 
04:00:17.550 --> 04:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
Senate know and then we'll go from there
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
I think we're a long way from there but
 
04:00:21.550 --> 04:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
for me and from what I've heard from the
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
constituents that requested this a
 
04:00:25.950 --> 04:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
couple years ago uh it seems to be a
 
04:00:27.790 --> 04:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
worthwhile expenditure in some fashion
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't think a I think a pilot I
 
04:00:32.189 --> 04:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
mean it's kind of akin to a sunset right
 
04:00:34.030 --> 04:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's one of the tools we use in our
 
04:00:38.469 --> 04:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
legislative toolbox to find a way find a
 
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
way to yes find a way to fixing the
 
04:00:40.720 --> 04:00:42.670 align:start position:0%
way to yes find a way to fixing the
problem

04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
04:00:46.110 --> 04:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
that's how I look at
 
04:00:48.910 --> 04:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Morris thank
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
question so line 15 where it says shall
 
04:00:54.910 --> 04:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
not include programs that use restrain
 
04:00:56.950 --> 04:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
or seclusion would you still support the
 
04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill if it was changed from shall not to
 
04:01:01.030 --> 04:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
maybe in a last resort scenario so that
 
04:01:03.950 --> 04:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
way the pilot program can still be a
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
trial and error period but they can
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
still revert as a worst case scenario in
 
04:01:12.790 --> 04:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
extreme circumstances well sure um I I
 
04:01:15.309 --> 04:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
think the point of that is is let's look
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
for different for programs that do
 
04:01:18.910 --> 04:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
things differently than what we
 
04:01:23.070 --> 04:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
currently do so sure I'd still support
 
04:01:26.469 --> 04:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
it um the point is doing the same thing
 
04:01:28.389 --> 04:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
that we already do is going to produce
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
the same result so you know why bother
 
04:01:33.870 --> 04:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
like why why go to the effort of a pilot
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
program that uses programs that are
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
doing what we already do we're not going
 
04:01:41.710 --> 04:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
to get any new data so I think that's I
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
think that's the intent of that and
 
04:01:45.670 --> 04:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
maybe it's inelegantly worded but I
 
04:01:47.710 --> 04:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
think that's the point you know the
 
04:01:49.229 --> 04:01:49.239 align:start position:0%
definition of insanity is repeating the
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
same thing over and over and just
 
04:01:52.189 --> 04:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
expecting a different result so we just
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat the same thing that
 
04:01:56.030 --> 04:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're already doing so we're looking for
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
programs that do something different
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
such as and the answer to the what's the
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
something different um are things like
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know positive behavioral support
 
04:02:05.469 --> 04:02:05.479 align:start position:0%
timeouts teaching replacement skills
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
those are some of the things that are
 
04:02:09.389 --> 04:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
commonly found in those other programs
 
04:02:10.590 --> 04:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying we don't already do
 
04:02:12.510 --> 04:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
some of those things because in in
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
certain cases we do
 
04:02:15.870 --> 04:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
at least I've I've been you know told we
 
04:02:15.880 --> 04:02:16.990 align:start position:0%
at least I've I've been you know told we
do

04:02:16.990 --> 04:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
so okay further questions represent
 
04:02:21.630 --> 04:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank you thank you for taking
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
my question line 10 when it's talking
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
about programs it does say such as the
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
California evidence-based clearance so
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be through them it's
 
04:02:32.910 --> 04:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
just that's an example correct yes
 
04:02:34.110 --> 04:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
correct you're correct in that they
 
04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
could look someplace else AB absolutely
 
04:02:40.110 --> 04:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
thank you rury thank you Mr chair and
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um with
 
04:02:43.950 --> 04:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
regard and maybe this is not a question
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
for you but with regard to the technical
 
04:02:47.309 --> 04:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
advisory that the Department of
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
Education did put out um in uh 2023 I
 
04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
think September um it does mention um
 
04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion being um
 
04:03:00.189 --> 04:03:00.199 align:start position:0%
referenced in 126 U to traditional
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
Public public charter schools publics
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
and approved non-public schools this
 
04:03:06.510 --> 04:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
piece of legislations if I'm
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
interpreting it correctly is only
 
04:03:10.870 --> 04:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
looking at certain School populations or
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
is it open to all of those the same um
 
04:03:16.750 --> 04:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
that the list that I just read so yeah
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty familiar with the ta uh and I
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
think this looks wouldn't apply to I
 
04:03:25.309 --> 04:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
think this applies to all all schools
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
but I'll I'll leave it to some of the
 
04:03:28.910 --> 04:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
experts behind me to clarify but the you
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
know the TA is is what it is it was from
 
04:03:32.349 --> 04:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:03:35.429 --> 04:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
doe yeah no no I appreciate the followup
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
if I may I I guess I was just looking at
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
the the cohort of individuals that you
 
04:03:42.149 --> 04:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
were saying in elementary school a
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
there's a list of of
 
04:03:46.149 --> 04:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
types of schools that shall be included
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the pilot program I just wanted to
 
04:03:50.590 --> 04:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
make sure it could be any of those types
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
of schools settings I don't see why not
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
wherever you know wherever these come
 
04:03:58.590 --> 04:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
from like the two highest per
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
capita uh schools with these density
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
populations I I don't think it should be
 
04:04:05.189 --> 04:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
limited to any
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
particular School District thank you in
 
04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
my opinion okay thank you further
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
questions just keeping the keeping the
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
goal in mind of reduction of this this
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
procedure right right yes thank you very
 
04:04:21.070 --> 04:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony and for being
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman thank you so
 
04:04:22.800 --> 04:04:24.389 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman thank you so
much

04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:04:28.229 --> 04:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
members um Moren and I'm sorry I can't
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
read the last name Tracy
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
it can you hear me yes okay um so I was
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
the one that um gathered families
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
together in marac um in regards to uh
 
04:04:56.189 --> 04:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
the original bill with cameras um
 
04:04:58.630 --> 04:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
because I I'm a former educator I've
 
04:05:01.469 --> 04:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
taught preschool all the way up to um
 
04:05:04.990 --> 04:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
highered and I also am a mom of a
 
04:05:06.670 --> 04:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
daughter who has prayer Willy syndrome
 
04:05:09.550 --> 04:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
it's kind of as like autism plus food
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
type of a thing and at 13 days old they
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
told me that I better learn Behavior cuz
 
04:05:16.950 --> 04:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
someday she would be bigger than me so I
 
04:05:18.670 --> 04:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
have taken every Behavior course there
 
04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
is Under the Sun um
 
04:05:24.990 --> 04:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
so I have worked my working with kids
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
with emotional Behavior disabilities has
 
04:05:32.149 --> 04:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
been what I have done in the past and I
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
have only had to restrain one child and
 
04:05:37.950 --> 04:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
that was we were on a field trip and I
 
04:05:39.790 --> 04:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
thought he was non-verbal and I thought
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
he was going to touch a um pizza oven
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
hot stove on the end and so I grabbed
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
them and I and I held him them back and
 
04:05:50.269 --> 04:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
it turns out it wasn't even hot on that
 
04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
side and that was it and I I worked in
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester school districts I worked
 
04:05:57.630 --> 04:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
with with um students
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
6'8 with emotional Behavior disabilities
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
and I had SRO officers ask me to help
 
04:06:07.750 --> 04:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
deescalate them um this was a life skill
 
04:06:10.229 --> 04:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
that I needed right but yet I was able
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
to learn how to do that most kids who
 
04:06:16.030 --> 04:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
are restrained are between the ages of 4
 
04:06:20.149 --> 04:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
and 10 maybe 12 um most of them if not
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
all have disabilities whether they're
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
documented or not um the families that
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
came to me and this is why I asked for
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
the cameras most of them were
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
non-verbal children who were coming home
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
with bruises and nobody knew why split
 
04:06:41.630 --> 04:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
lips um bumps on the heads there's
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
pictures and that's very scary for a
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
parent um as far as my professional life
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
I was blessed to work for UNH at the
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
institute on disability um back in 2006
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
to about 2014 doing this exact work of
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
PBIS in schools I've worked in schools
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
all over the state um I was actually
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
even hired as the first um PBIS director
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
over in lonia where at one of their
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
elementary schools when I got got there
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
there was over 3,000 referrals to the
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
office that's Elementary School by the
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
time I left it was down to 500 and this
 
04:07:24.550 --> 04:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
is all about being
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
proactive um not reactive um what
 
04:07:30.590 --> 04:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
happens is our brains go into fight or
 
04:07:32.990 --> 04:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
flight any of us could have a behavior
 
04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
if we were walking down the street and
 
04:07:36.670 --> 04:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
somebody started to come after us and we
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
were feeling threatened our body would
 
04:07:41.550 --> 04:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
naturally take over and that's what
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
happens to a lot of these kids so it's
 
04:07:46.870 --> 04:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
very very important to get there in
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
deescalate I will say one thing that I
 
04:07:51.389 --> 04:07:51.399 align:start position:0%
learned which is life space Crisis
 
04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
Intervention um that was a very amazing
 
04:07:58.189 --> 04:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
tool that helped keep kids down um
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
reduce kids um behaviors um typically a
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
behavior will last for 20 minutes once
 
04:08:05.590 --> 04:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
that automatic process happens and
 
04:08:08.349 --> 04:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes us adults end up
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
escalating it because we talk too much
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
we get too many people around and stuff
 
04:08:15.109 --> 04:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
like that um um I did get a call last
 
04:08:19.870 --> 04:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
week from a a mom in a town close by
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
that her 7-year-old was out at recess
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come in from Recess he has
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
autism came down the slide principal
 
04:08:31.710 --> 04:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
yelled at him he threw snow he was
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
thrown into the green room um and so
 
04:08:38.590 --> 04:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
this is still happening I was shocked
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
that it it had ever happened I didn't
 
04:08:42.670 --> 04:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
know that it happened until my daughter
 
04:08:45.109 --> 04:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
went to an out of placement then I found
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
out later on that yes Al a lot of
 
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
schools here in New Hampshire do have
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
them um I really think it's about being
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
proactive it's called ABC data um
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
blending programs together like Maine
 
04:09:00.269 --> 04:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
has Maine also has the collaborative
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
solving problem um process which really
 
04:09:07.630 --> 04:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
works as well we have PBIS at the state
 
04:09:10.710 --> 04:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
now um one of the hardest things I think
 
04:09:12.910 --> 04:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
is doing it with Fidelity and if we're
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
not doing it with Fidelity and we're not
 
04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
providing coaching and positive
 
04:09:19.229 --> 04:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
reinforcement to our leaders our
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
teachers our
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
administrators um that it it's just not
 
04:09:26.149 --> 04:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to work but I I really am very
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
thankful for representative patrino for
 
04:09:32.269 --> 04:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
bringing this um continuing this moving
 
04:09:34.910 --> 04:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
forward I would eventually like to see
 
04:09:37.469 --> 04:09:37.479 align:start position:0%
cameras in these rooms where kids are
 
04:09:40.030 --> 04:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
not in every classroom um but we're kids
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
who are nonverbal because let's admit if
 
04:09:45.149 --> 04:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
you think you might get fired because
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
you did something wrong and there's a
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
kidle there that's
 
04:09:51.149 --> 04:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
nonverbal what are you going to say and
 
04:09:53.790 --> 04:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of times people well
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
I know this so I have a daughter who
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
came to substitute in the school with me
 
04:10:00.670 --> 04:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
when she was in between her breaks and
 
04:10:03.389 --> 04:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
college they put her with the hardest
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
student with no training she has a
 
04:10:08.189 --> 04:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
sister so she's had Hands-On training
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
and she's excellent at it but if she
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
hadn't it would have ended really bad so
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
so um I guess I I'm very supportive of
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
anything that will help to reduce
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
restraints and seclusion in schools
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
especially if it's happening over and
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
over again to a child thank you thank
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
you very much uh
 
04:10:32.670 --> 04:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
questions represent Cornell Thank you
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question what is
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
lifespace Crisis Intervention life
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
spaced Crisis Intervention is a
 
04:10:43.469 --> 04:10:43.479 align:start position:0%
deescalation tool kind of like CPI um
 
04:10:46.389 --> 04:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
which CPI is a dis dis deescalation tool
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
but CPI does talk about restraints this
 
04:10:51.630 --> 04:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
does not and it has actually four
 
04:10:54.389 --> 04:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
different methods on using it it's being
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
able to identify way down here because
 
04:11:01.389 --> 04:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
you can and um way down here before it
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
gets to way up here because once you've
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
gone past that honestly biological
 
04:11:10.109 --> 04:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
process you have to let it run its
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
course uh if I could ask um
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:11:19.349 --> 04:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
prescribes um certain um programs that
 
04:11:21.070 --> 04:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
are evidence-based by a national
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
Clearing House and gave an
 
04:11:25.790 --> 04:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
example um but shall not
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
include uh programs using Crisis
 
04:11:31.950 --> 04:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
Prevention training or deescalation
 
04:11:35.109 --> 04:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
training or behavior management training
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
based on your experience do you have
 
04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts on um those two sections of
 
04:11:40.199 --> 04:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
thoughts on um those two sections of
this

04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
bill uh could you could you just repat
 
04:11:46.750 --> 04:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
put that last part again the the last um
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
part is um evidence-based Alternatives
 
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
shall not include for the pilot program
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
um Crisis Prevention training
 
04:12:01.710 --> 04:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
deescalation training or behavior
 
04:12:01.720 --> 04:12:03.149 align:start position:0%
deescalation training or behavior
management

04:12:03.149 --> 04:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
management
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
training I think actually yeah because
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
what you could do is look at data and
 
04:12:13.429 --> 04:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
being ABC data which is not included in
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
that and putting in plans in place I
 
04:12:18.750 --> 04:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
think if if it's it's all about being
 
04:12:21.189 --> 04:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
proactive um if you know and that's why
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's so important to collect the right
 
04:12:25.309 --> 04:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
data you can even if a child is
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
non-verbal you can everybody starts to
 
04:12:31.469 --> 04:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
have um um routines that we just it
 
04:12:32.910 --> 04:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
keeps us safe when we do the same
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
routines every day and so if we're able
 
04:12:38.630 --> 04:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
to look at that and instruct I I think
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
um Senator moo had said like um
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
replacement Behavior
 
04:12:45.550 --> 04:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
that's a huge thing that I see that's
 
04:12:48.830 --> 04:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
not put in you can't stop one Behavior
 
04:12:51.149 --> 04:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
without giving it something else because
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
a behavior is a form of communication
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
they're trying to communicate something
 
04:12:57.510 --> 04:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
you can't stop that without giving
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
something else more appropriate and
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what we look at so am
 
04:13:05.429 --> 04:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
I correct in my understanding of what
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that some forms of
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
deescalation training and behavior
 
04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
management um might be included in the
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
pilot or is it just looking at data
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
related to um those methods I would say
 
04:13:22.910 --> 04:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
it would be Beyond just looking at the
 
04:13:25.389 --> 04:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
data but in the practices I think the
 
04:13:30.750 --> 04:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
data the practices in the um the um
 
04:13:33.630 --> 04:13:33.640 align:start position:0%
what's the word I'm looking for make
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
doing it with Fidelity will say okay if
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
if you do this you know then you get
 
04:13:40.510 --> 04:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
this but then I don't have time for this
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
so then it doesn't really work so making
 
04:13:44.830 --> 04:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
sure you have Fidelity I think
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
deescalation is already there CPI is
 
04:13:50.109 --> 04:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
already there I think it's almost in
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
every school CPI but it's still not
 
04:13:55.030 --> 04:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
working so what is it that's missing
 
04:13:57.630 --> 04:13:57.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's not working um one one
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
more is um you mentioned ABC data um
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
could you y what is ABC data so it's
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually setting AB setting so it's
 
04:14:09.429 --> 04:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
setting anant behavior and consequence
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
so a setting event might be a kiddo is
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the bus and he just got bullied say
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
um he gets off the bus and the
 
04:14:20.429 --> 04:14:20.439 align:start position:0%
antecedent is what happens right before
 
04:14:22.750 --> 04:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
a behavior so the teacher says take out
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
your homework that's the antecedent well
 
04:14:27.870 --> 04:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
the child doesn't have the homework he's
 
04:14:30.030 --> 04:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
already upset about what's going on he
 
04:14:32.109 --> 04:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
just wants to get out and he just slams
 
04:14:34.429 --> 04:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
his hand down and says something that's
 
04:14:36.750 --> 04:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
the behavior the consequence doesn't
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean a punishment it's what
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
H what changed in the environment so the
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
teacher may say say go down to the
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
office and that's actually what the kid
 
04:14:49.990 --> 04:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
wanted he wanted to escape that feeling
 
04:14:51.429 --> 04:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
right cuz it's about it's a lot about
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
feelings so um feelings trigger
 
04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
behaviors so that would be ABC data so
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
you look at that and you're able very
 
04:15:00.910 --> 04:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
clearly there's actually Swiss it's
 
04:15:03.269 --> 04:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
called Swiss data some schools have it
 
04:15:05.229 --> 04:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
it really was pretty inexpensive I want
 
04:15:07.790 --> 04:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
to say it was like $300 when we used it
 
04:15:10.349 --> 04:15:10.359 align:start position:0%
in lonia and you're able to track it we
 
04:15:13.590 --> 04:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
were able to track in lonia that the
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
week before Christmas there was a huge
 
04:15:19.349 --> 04:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
influx of Behavioral referrals so we put
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
in a targeted um intervention the week
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
before and boom they all went down so if
 
04:15:27.750 --> 04:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
you it's it's it's like being at a
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
grocery store where you know if you buy
 
04:15:33.030 --> 04:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
the I heard once you know the father
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
goes and gets beer on a Thursday night
 
04:15:36.670 --> 04:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
and they put the diapers right next door
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
you know that's thoughtful to make
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
something a behavior happen and that's
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
kind of really what schools are like
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
schools are very
 
04:15:46.030 --> 04:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
um Pro reactive they're not proactive
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we don't give them enough
 
04:15:50.269 --> 04:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
time to be proactive
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
either thank you very much questions
 
04:15:54.910 --> 04:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cel thank you
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
so much and thank you for taking my
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
question I just want to be clear you use
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
the um acronym PBIS as that positive
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
behavior intervention systems yes so
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's two pb's there big Capital PBIS
 
04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
and there's little PBIS um so big PBIS
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
is positive behavior interventions and
 
04:16:15.149 --> 04:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
supports it's a systemic way of looking
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
at um behaviors throughout a school
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
teaching behaviors teaching appropriate
 
04:16:24.269 --> 04:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
behaviors um and we've had it here I
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
think since 2002 throughout New
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the hard part is you get
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
turnover and then kind of it starts to
 
04:16:34.109 --> 04:16:34.119 align:start position:0%
kind of slip away
 
04:16:37.149 --> 04:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes further questions see none
 
04:16:38.910 --> 04:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your for your
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%

653 um as you heard before us um you

place with this bill before you today
 
04:17:29.670 --> 04:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to briefly share excuse me I'm
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
going to briefly share a bit about our
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
office um for those who may not be
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
familiar the office of the child
 
04:17:36.910 --> 04:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
advocate is an independent impartial
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
state agency we are mandated with
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
protecting the best interests of New
 
04:17:43.349 --> 04:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children we have direct
 
04:17:46.269 --> 04:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
oversight over our executive branch
 
04:17:48.269 --> 04:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
child serving agencies in the state and
 
04:17:49.990 --> 04:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
any entity that has contracted with them
 
04:17:52.109 --> 04:17:52.119 align:start position:0%
for services primarily when we were
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
first developed our oversight was
 
04:17:55.349 --> 04:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
directly over the department for
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
children youth and families um our child
 
04:18:00.109 --> 04:18:00.119 align:start position:0%
welfare system and juvenile justice but
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have had expanded jurisdiction since
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
2020 which expanded us to all executive
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
branch child serving agencies in our
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
role in the state we have um certain
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
aspects that we are mandated through our
 
04:18:13.550 --> 04:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
statute such as reviewing restraint and
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
seclusions for children placed in
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
residential facilities um this is not
 
04:18:19.630 --> 04:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
inclusive of schools I want to make sure
 
04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
that is very clear um and we have other
 
04:18:24.870 --> 04:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
aspects of our um statute that relate to
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
calls coming to our office and U
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
managing complaints from constituents
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
and also looking for Trends and gaps in
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
our system to be able to um help close
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
those gaps and ensure better services to
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
the children across New Hampshire um so
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
what brought us to this bill is again
 
04:18:44.950 --> 04:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
our our jurisdiction is specifically
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to restraint and seclusion
 
04:18:49.189 --> 04:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
over residential facilities and has not
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
been with schools um we have received an
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
influx of calls from parents over the
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
past couple of years with concerns for
 
04:18:56.830 --> 04:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
restraints and seclusions in school of
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
their children um since we do not have
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
direct oversight or a way to review
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
those we do look at the aggregate
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
numbers that are shared through New
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education and um
 
04:19:09.149 --> 04:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
we talk with schools on a one-on-one
 
04:19:10.830 --> 04:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
basis dependent on the inquiry that's
 
04:19:13.149 --> 04:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
come to our office and we try to further
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
explore and see how we're doing as a
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
state in reducing the restraint and
 
04:19:19.309 --> 04:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
seclusion in that setting as well um
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
what we have found is over the years um
 
04:19:22.670 --> 04:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
there's not been a drastic dip in
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
Restraint and seclusion numbers in our
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
educational settings and that has been a
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
concern to us and again we continue to
 
04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
receive calls from families so it stays
 
04:19:32.469 --> 04:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
on our radar although it is not
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily an aspect of our day-to-day
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
work it is an important issue that
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
directly impacts the children of New
 
04:19:40.710 --> 04:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so with that said um we hosted
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
a movie screening um with the support of
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
Dr Ross green um in lives in the balance
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
and um the the name of that is the kids
 
04:19:52.590 --> 04:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
we lose um very moving film documenting
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
the experiences that children have and
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
when they exhibit restraint and
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
seclusions in school as well as um the
 
04:20:00.910 --> 04:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
difficulties that their parents face in
 
04:20:02.349 --> 04:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
trying to understand and support their
 
04:20:04.510 --> 04:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
child when they are not necessarily
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
allowed or welcomed into the school
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
setting um in doing that we did have an
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
outpouring of support and wanting to do
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
more to um address this
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
issue um to to this day we are
 
04:20:18.189 --> 04:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
continuing to get phone calls from
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
families we got one just this week about
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
a 5-year-old child that has had 22
 
04:20:27.149 --> 04:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
restraints in one day 5-year-old
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
kindergartener it's just heartbreaking
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
and this is what our children are
 
04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing in school so we know we
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
need to do better we know we need more
 
04:20:36.189 --> 04:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
we also understand the impact that this
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
has on Educators the Educators that we
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
have spoken to some of them have been
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
the ones that have called into our
 
04:20:43.590 --> 04:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
office very concerned about a child in
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
their district and wanting to help and
 
04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
do more they feel like their hands are
 
04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
tied and they know that they are not
 
04:20:51.149 --> 04:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
doing what's best for the child they
 
04:20:52.510 --> 04:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
understand that restraints have a
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
negative impact and further traumatized
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
children but they are using the tools
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
that are within their toolbox right now
 
04:20:59.550 --> 04:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that relies with that that
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
end result of restraint and seclusion
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
they will attempt to deescalate but what
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
we have learned is at that point it is
 
04:21:07.550 --> 04:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
far too late in working and partnering
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
with lives in the balance and Dr Ross
 
04:21:11.790 --> 04:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
Green we've learned quite a bit about
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
the importance of proactive approach and
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
what we mean by that is not waiting for
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
the behavior as we had just heard right
 
04:21:21.550 --> 04:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
those ABCs not waiting to get to the bee
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
to look at addressing the issue that's
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
where deescalation comes in you wait for
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
the behavior to happen first and then
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
you try to deescalate the situation at
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
that point it's too late and so we don't
 
04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
want more of the same we want our
 
04:21:36.030 --> 04:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
Educators to have tools that are
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
different than what they already have at
 
04:21:39.469 --> 04:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
their hands they already receive
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion training which
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
which already incorpor Ates deescalation
 
04:21:45.510 --> 04:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
techniques we want them to have
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
additional tools on top of that and what
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
this would mean is it would give them an
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to understand their students
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
in a different way look out for an
 
04:21:56.030 --> 04:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
escalation before it is at the point of
 
04:21:58.590 --> 04:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
escalation and be able to engage at that
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
point to help reduce the what is
 
04:22:02.429 --> 04:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
happening for the child and help
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
stabilize the child in the entire
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
classroom um an example that was was
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
given when talking with Dr Ross Green is
 
04:22:12.070 --> 04:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
an example of a child um not wanting to
 
04:22:14.189 --> 04:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
move on to the next subject and what do
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
we see often in schools we see there
 
04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
being a power struggle between the
 
04:22:18.510 --> 04:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
teacher and that child getting them to
 
04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
move on to that next subject is there a
 
04:22:22.349 --> 04:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
way that the teacher could come to a
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
compromise with a child it is difficult
 
04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
we know they have a curriculum that they
 
04:22:28.229 --> 04:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
have to stick to but if they feel they
 
04:22:30.910 --> 04:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
have tools they can do that with that
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
one child and continue to move on and
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
manage the rest of the classroom in a
 
04:22:36.670 --> 04:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
successful way that's really what we're
 
04:22:39.229 --> 04:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
looking to do here with this bill and
 
04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
allow allowing a pilot program allows us
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to try something to see
 
04:22:45.670 --> 04:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
if it works before expending a lot of
 
04:22:47.950 --> 04:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
State funds on pushing out a new program
 
04:22:49.229 --> 04:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of programs that have
 
04:22:50.950 --> 04:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
been offered in the educational realm
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
and as we heard and as we see on a
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
regular basis they're not enough they're
 
04:22:57.950 --> 04:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
not working on their own and so can we
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
try something collect some data and see
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
if it's working before sharing it across
 
04:23:08.149 --> 04:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
all right I had a cough coming so she
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
could take it at that point uh well we
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
love to answer some of the questions you
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
all were asking which were really
 
04:23:27.070 --> 04:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
fantastic questions um 126 U um is the
 
04:23:28.349 --> 04:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
law that covers all this I know there
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
are some questions about specific
 
04:23:32.349 --> 04:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
definitions it's been worked on
 
04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
repeatedly there were new bills in 2023
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
and again uh Senator McHugh brought up
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
another bill last year so this is a hot
 
04:23:43.710 --> 04:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
topic of conversation 12 you really does
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh contain a lot of great definitions
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
but again it's trying to get to that
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
preventative space so um and I know a
 
04:23:53.830 --> 04:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
lot of the questions have been around
 
04:23:56.710 --> 04:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
the specific language in the bill about
 
04:24:00.189 --> 04:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
what it is to Pilot and what it is not
 
04:24:02.109 --> 04:24:02.119 align:start position:0%
and really it's not intended to take
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
away any of the current tools it's to
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that if again the state is
 
04:24:09.389 --> 04:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
paying for a pilot project that it's in
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
fact a new and different approach so
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um with those examples is
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
just sort of best practice of what is in
 
04:24:22.590 --> 04:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
that preventative space and then what it
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
is not is really programs that already
 
04:24:26.950 --> 04:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
exist not intending to take those
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
programs away but certainly not to spend
 
04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
additional State funds piloting stuff
 
04:24:34.349 --> 04:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
that already exists so that is why it
 
04:24:38.189 --> 04:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
was worded that way um Ben Jones who's
 
04:24:40.469 --> 04:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
the the policy director at lives in the
 
04:24:42.870 --> 04:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
balance emailed you all um
 
04:24:45.109 --> 04:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
testimony unfortunately this is Maine's
 
04:24:46.750 --> 04:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
school vacation week so he was not
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
available to come um but he did include
 
04:24:52.109 --> 04:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
some data as um both representative
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
patrino and Senator Miku mentioned Maine
 
04:24:58.149 --> 04:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
has really been on the Forefront but he
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
also included uh data from Virginia to
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
give you sort of a look at a large
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
school district versus a small school
 
04:25:08.550 --> 04:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
district and how that has rolled out
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
successfully um some of the questions
 
04:25:13.149 --> 04:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
around that the different categories
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
again we see in our office uh calls from
 
04:25:18.910 --> 04:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
all different spaces from elementary
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
schools some of the highest restraints
 
04:25:22.910 --> 04:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
are in some of our elementary schools um
 
04:25:24.750 --> 04:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
to those alternative settings so the
 
04:25:27.790 --> 04:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
intent was really just to be able to
 
04:25:30.070 --> 04:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
gather data from a wide swath of the
 
04:25:31.950 --> 04:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
population because this is actually an
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
issue everywhere um but it to get a
 
04:25:36.990 --> 04:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
really good uh data sample you would
 
04:25:39.630 --> 04:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
need to sort of sample um and again it
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
is an optin program so you know
 
04:25:45.269 --> 04:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education would put
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
out an RFP to find a vendor and then
 
04:25:50.469 --> 04:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
schools could elect to opt in and again
 
04:25:52.590 --> 04:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
last year through Senator McHugh's bill
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
as well as that interim study several
 
04:25:57.790 --> 04:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
schools had already shown interest of
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
yes we have all these tools but we know
 
04:26:01.109 --> 04:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
that there's more out there we would
 
04:26:03.630 --> 04:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
love the opportunity to get this
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
training and try some new things and
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
there are schools that are trying new
 
04:26:08.950 --> 04:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
things here and there but not in a
 
04:26:10.510 --> 04:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
really systemic way that's able to
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
collect meaningful data to see could
 
04:26:15.429 --> 04:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
truly work so it is intended to be sort
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
of a layered approach and really be able
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
to test out something new here in New
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like's been done in other
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
states um we did include in our
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
testimony a link to that documentary uh
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
the kids we lose you can watch it for
 
04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
free on YouTube um it is really
 
04:26:35.389 --> 04:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
compelling it is pretty intense um and
 
04:26:37.109 --> 04:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
also the lives in the balance website
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
which I believe um attorney Jones
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
included does have a lot of really
 
04:26:42.429 --> 04:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
interesting data they've worked with a
 
04:26:43.710 --> 04:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
lot of different states a lot of
 
04:26:45.870 --> 04:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
different types of school districts um
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
so we really just want to bring some of
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
these options to New Hampshire um you
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
know the calls we get from Educators it
 
04:26:55.389 --> 04:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
is really stressful for them to have to
 
04:26:59.070 --> 04:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
put hands on kids who are in distress uh
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
so really this is a tool for everybody
 
04:27:04.469 --> 04:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
and and to add um we did make a note as
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
well in our testimony about um the
 
04:27:08.189 --> 04:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note we know the fiscal climate
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
this year and understand and worked
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
really hard um and what one of the
 
04:27:12.750 --> 04:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why we
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
into lives in the balance is because
 
04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
they have done this before and so asking
 
04:27:17.309 --> 04:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions of how they rolled
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
this out and and remain fiscally
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
conservative and so really a lot of the
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
work in this bill was um intending for
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
the data collection to happen at the
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
school level to be shared out to the
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
districts and then from the district to
 
04:27:33.309 --> 04:27:33.319 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Department of Education
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the vendor would be working very
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
closely with them to assist in analyzing
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
the data and in getting a report put
 
04:27:40.950 --> 04:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
together so to really reduce the burden
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:27:44.910 --> 04:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
education and put some of that on the
 
04:27:46.750 --> 04:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
vendor to step up and assist with that
 
04:27:49.269 --> 04:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
data collection reporting
 
04:27:51.269 --> 04:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
process we are open to any other
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%

individual districts with this
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
program yes we have spoken with some of
 
04:28:11.550 --> 04:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
the districts as has um Dr Green and

schools as well um and there is an
 
04:28:27.189 --> 04:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
interest for more and they have voiced
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
feeling that they need other tools to be
 
04:28:33.870 --> 04:28:33.880 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro District
 
04:30:05.469 --> 04:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
2 in November of 2020 Governor sonunu
 
04:30:08.830 --> 04:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
issued a mask mandate that mandate
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
Exempted K through 12 students teachers
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
and staff school boards created their
 
04:30:17.910 --> 04:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
own policies for masking students
 
04:30:20.109 --> 04:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
following guidance and recommendations
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
from the doe and
 
04:30:25.790 --> 04:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
DHHS if a district decided that they
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave it to parent choice they
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
were free to do so to my knowledge no
 
04:30:31.520 --> 04:30:33.149 align:start position:0%
were free to do so to my knowledge no
one

04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
did as time marched on parents which
 
04:30:40.349 --> 04:30:40.359 align:start position:0%
includes me I was a Public School parent
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
we grew more frustrated with the mask
 
04:30:47.229 --> 04:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
mandates because we saw that masking our
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
healthy children was having a negative
 
04:30:53.389 --> 04:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
impact on their learning their speech
 
04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
their mental and emotional well-being
 
04:31:00.109 --> 04:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
their physical health and their Social
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
Development we voiced our concerns at
 
04:31:05.429 --> 04:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meetings voices that got
 
04:31:09.510 --> 04:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
much louder as the months dragged on but
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
there were some mask lawsuits across the
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
state one in my district these lawsuits
 
04:31:24.189 --> 04:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
were dismissed by many as frivolous but
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
parents were trying everything they
 
04:31:29.389 --> 04:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
could to make this stop because their
 
04:31:32.830 --> 04:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
harmed students dealing with autism
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
anxiety asthma or learning disabilities
 
04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
were not able to get exemption for these
 
04:31:45.870 --> 04:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
mandates however under the governor's
 
04:31:47.630 --> 04:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
mandate they would
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
have Co was a difficult time for all but
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
the response to covid was most difficult
 
04:31:56.990 --> 04:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
on children a heavy burden was placed on
 
04:32:00.109 --> 04:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
them to protect adults they were treated
 
04:32:02.109 --> 04:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
as if they and those around them were
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
perpetually sick creating a climate of
 
04:32:09.109 --> 04:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
fear students were repeatedly told that
 
04:32:11.149 --> 04:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
they would get their family members sick
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
if they didn't keep their masks up they
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
had to wear masks in school on the bus
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
during gym class at recess outdoors and
 
04:32:23.950 --> 04:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
even while playing instruments they cut
 
04:32:26.469 --> 04:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
holes around the mouth so they could fit
 
04:32:28.429 --> 04:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
the mouthpiece
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
in in February of 22 Governor sununu
 
04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
said that school districts would no
 
04:32:36.990 --> 04:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
longer be able to mandate masks and
 
04:32:39.670 --> 04:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
those that continued their mandates
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of Ed 306
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
rules Governor sununu left it up to
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
local control initially but then said
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
they could no longer have no local
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
control but then he went back to local
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
control when he vetoed this bill two
 
04:33:00.910 --> 04:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
times our local school boards didn't
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
have the best time during covid either
 
04:33:07.230 --> 04:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
they bore the brunt of the anger and
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
frustration this bill protects our
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
school board from ever school boards
 
04:33:16.029 --> 04:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
from ever being put into that situation
 
04:33:18.510 --> 04:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
again I know my school board wouldn't
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
want a
 
04:33:23.310 --> 04:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
repeat let's learn from the mistakes of
 
04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
the past let's realize that there is no
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
decision more local than that of a
 
04:33:31.269 --> 04:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
family thank
 
04:33:34.869 --> 04:33:34.879 align:start position:0%

this is to
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
prevent another catastrophe from
 
04:34:32.639 --> 04:34:35.670 align:start position:0%
prevent another catastrophe from
happening

04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%

04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative I remember in the
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
discussions in previous years we had
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
talked about IEPs and five or four plans
 
04:35:18.109 --> 04:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
does this bill exempt um students with
 
04:35:20.670 --> 04:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
IEPs or five or fours a mask is required
 
04:35:24.029 --> 04:35:24.039 align:start position:0%
as a part of their plan yes um thank you
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
for the question that's actually um the
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
new update that we did last year to to
 
04:35:30.750 --> 04:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that was brought the previous
 
04:35:34.349 --> 04:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
year so this this is a third time thanks
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
maybe yes representative U Morris yes uh
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
04:35:44.869 --> 04:35:44.879 align:start position:0%
question is it true that this bill is
 
04:35:47.789 --> 04:35:47.799 align:start position:0%
both reactive and
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
proactive thank you for the question I
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
yes representive Bon thank you Mr chair
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
um I see that there are some Provisions
 
04:36:03.150 --> 04:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
for students with iaps and accommodation
 
04:36:05.189 --> 04:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
plans but there don't appear to be any
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
provisions for uh staff members who
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
might have issues health issues and for
 
04:36:14.189 --> 04:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
which masking around them would be
 
04:36:14.199 --> 04:36:18.189 align:start position:0%
which masking around them would be
Gravely

04:36:18.189 --> 04:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
important I thinkk you for the question
 
04:36:25.029 --> 04:36:25.039 align:start position:0%
I so you're asking that children should
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
be mandated masks if a a staff member is
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
sick is that am I getting that
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
correct correct if you're making
 
04:36:37.949 --> 04:36:37.959 align:start position:0%
accommodations for for health reasons
 
04:36:39.629 --> 04:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
for students which is you know
 
04:36:42.269 --> 04:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate individual but um there are
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
adults that work in situations that do
 
04:36:47.590 --> 04:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
have health issues and being around
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
people that could potentially be
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
carrying germs could be very detrimental
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
to their health as
 
04:36:57.551 --> 04:36:57.561 align:start position:0%
well I I think if they're free to wear a
 
04:37:00.189 --> 04:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
mass themselves and if you believe that
 
04:37:02.910 --> 04:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
mass work then they should be protected
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
my concern and and so that did come up
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
last last time if there was a child that
 
04:37:09.470 --> 04:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
was sick in the
 
04:37:12.590 --> 04:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
classroom um
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a rare
 
04:37:18.750 --> 04:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
situation um and I don't
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
think it prevents them from asking the
 
04:37:24.789 --> 04:37:24.799 align:start position:0%
parents if the kids would mask in the
 
04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
classroom but I you can't mandate that
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
because it it did have a negative impact
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
on children's
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
learning and so I I think you can't have
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
a negative impact on the children
 
04:37:41.680 --> 04:37:43.189 align:start position:0%
a negative impact on the children
learning

04:37:43.189 --> 04:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
learning
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
experience and if if the sick child is
 
04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
okay further questions see none thank
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
you very much representative thank
 
04:38:01.230 --> 04:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
you and um for the uh following um
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
people testifying um I'd like to limit
 
04:38:06.429 --> 04:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
the testimony to three minutes if we if
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
we might and we'll start with
 
04:38:18.189 --> 04:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:20.590 --> 04:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman and members
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Sarah DeVito I am a
 
04:38:26.551 --> 04:38:26.561 align:start position:0%
state rep for Rockingham District 8 and
 
04:38:29.189 --> 04:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of this bill as a parent
 
04:38:31.830 --> 04:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsor I'm writing to express or
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
come here and speak to you to express my
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
strong support for House Bill 361 which
 
04:38:37.789 --> 04:38:37.799 align:start position:0%
prohibits mandatory Mass policies in
 
04:38:39.869 --> 04:38:39.879 align:start position:0%
schools this bill is essential to
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
ensuring that parents and students have
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
the right to make personal health
 
04:38:45.470 --> 04:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
decisions without government
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
mandates masking policy should be a
 
04:38:50.310 --> 04:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
matter of individual choice not a
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all requirement imposed by
 
04:38:55.150 --> 04:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
the schools parents know what is best
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
for their children's health and
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
well-being and they should be able to
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
have that ability to decide whether the
 
04:39:02.590 --> 04:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
child wears a mask during the school day
 
04:39:04.910 --> 04:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
additionally prolonged maske wearing can
 
04:39:07.470 --> 04:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
negatively impact students communication
 
04:39:09.070 --> 04:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
Social Development and learning
 
04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
experience particularly for young
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
children and those with special needs by
 
04:39:17.470 --> 04:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
passing H Bill 361 New Hampshire will
 
04:39:19.750 --> 04:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
reaffirm its commitment to parental
 
04:39:21.789 --> 04:39:21.799 align:start position:0%
rights individual freedom and a balanced
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
approach to Public Health I urge you to
 
04:39:26.349 --> 04:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill to protect students
 
04:39:27.949 --> 04:39:27.959 align:start position:0%
rights and ensure that health related
 
04:39:29.310 --> 04:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
decisions remain in the hands of
 
04:39:31.869 --> 04:39:31.879 align:start position:0%
families not government mandates thank
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much represent Morse
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for and thank you is it
 
04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
also true that um there's been a huge
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
increase in respiratory Health when it
 
04:39:46.590 --> 04:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
comes to mandating Children long-term
 
04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
use 8 hours a day same mask breathing in
 
04:39:51.430 --> 04:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
and out the same exact
 
04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
air I can only speak on behalf of what I
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
have experienced I had a child during
 
04:39:59.550 --> 04:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
covid um who attended public schools and
 
04:40:01.670 --> 04:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
was mandated to wear a mask and when he
 
04:40:03.510 --> 04:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
would come home um especially from
 
04:40:05.948 --> 04:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
playing sports the thing was filthy was
 
04:40:08.110 --> 04:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
disgusting um so we would send multiple
 
04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
masks for him to change throughout the
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
day but as a child um
 
04:40:14.230 --> 04:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
you can only expect so much um plus they
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
would get thrown in their bags um
 
04:40:18.270 --> 04:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes they would take it off for
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
lunch it would get thrown on the floor
 
04:40:22.990 --> 04:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
it was disgusting um a lot of the time
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
we would end up throwing them away at
 
04:40:28.110 --> 04:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the week um so yes and and he
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
did have a lot of respiratory um
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
illnesses after that just because of the
 
04:40:33.400 --> 04:40:34.550 align:start position:0%
illnesses after that just because of the
um

04:40:34.550 --> 04:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
exposure could I get a followup yes
 
04:40:40.910 --> 04:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you U followup to that would be so
 
04:40:40.920 --> 04:40:41.868 align:start position:0%
thank you U followup to that would be so
family

04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
because you probably spent a pretty good
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
amount of money on these masks
 
04:40:47.708 --> 04:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
considering the skyrocketed rates um you
 
04:40:50.470 --> 04:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
know when this whole thing happened um
 
04:40:52.030 --> 04:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
but lower income families that may not
 
04:40:53.628 --> 04:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
have been able to afford I mean there
 
04:40:55.550 --> 04:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
were masks that I saw kids using that
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
were the same mask for almost two weeks
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
straight when my child was in school
 
04:41:04.510 --> 04:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with this so the added expense
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:10.590 --> 04:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
is lower income families couldn't afford
 
04:41:10.600 --> 04:41:11.788 align:start position:0%
is lower income families couldn't afford
which

04:41:11.788 --> 04:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
was a larger increase yeah I guess I'll
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
back uh any further questions yes
 
04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
represent cluer thank you Mr chairman
 
04:41:27.310 --> 04:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um I'm
 
04:41:28.990 --> 04:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
wondering what you would think in the
 
04:41:32.628 --> 04:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
case of um an epidemic that would maybe
 
04:41:34.990 --> 04:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
hurt children such as I'll use the
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
measles because I remember having the
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
measles and it wasn't wasn't good what
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
would happen in that case if we
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
if we're putting into legislature that
 
04:41:47.150 --> 04:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
we cannot mandate it but what if it did
 
04:41:53.910 --> 04:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:57.788 --> 04:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
occur as a parent um and as someone in a
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
leadership role I would expect parents
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
um to use their common sense and keep
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
their child home if they were sick
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
um parents or someone like myself we
 
04:42:13.150 --> 04:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
have these children and we've been
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
giving given these children we get to
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
use our own knowledge to do what we
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
think is right or wrong um sending a
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
child home um would be what I would
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
expect leadership at a school to do if
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
they noticed a child was sick send them
 
04:42:30.430 --> 04:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
home rather than keep them in a in a
 
04:42:31.868 --> 04:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
building full of other children that's
 
04:42:33.990 --> 04:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
sick and putting a mask on them um it
 
04:42:36.670 --> 04:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem reasonable to me for
 
04:42:39.390 --> 04:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
that so I guess my question is why would
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
follow up um I think I was referring
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
more you know you might not know that
 
04:42:52.750 --> 04:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
someone has the start of an illness and
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
if we know that there is an epidemic out
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
there that's influencing the health of
 
04:43:01.470 --> 04:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
children wouldn't we want to protect
 
04:43:03.868 --> 04:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
them in in that
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
vein I think that could go with anything
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
um during the winter months we know that
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're kept indoors and so the flu ramps
 
04:43:14.830 --> 04:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
up um so does that mean that every
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
winter we should mask children I don't
 
04:43:20.030 --> 04:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
think so but we could do that with any
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
epidemic um or any sickness um I think
 
04:43:26.510 --> 04:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
the best thing is to build up our immune
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
system and use common sense um and keep
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
children sick or sick children home or
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:37.628 --> 04:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
officials represent McDonald thank you
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
for your work and co-sponsoring
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
this if there were a situations such as
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
an epidemic which was mentioned is it
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
true that this bill does not prevent the
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
governor or another state entity from
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
putting forward a mass mandate if they
 
04:43:54.560 --> 04:43:55.670 align:start position:0%
putting forward a mass mandate if they
sarf

04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
sarf
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
it correct thank
 
04:43:58.560 --> 04:44:00.550 align:start position:0%
it correct thank
you

04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:44:02.990 --> 04:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
repr thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:44:05.310 --> 04:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:44:08.830 --> 04:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh when the governor enacted all that in
 
04:44:11.750 --> 04:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the schools uh was there a spe specific
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
grade like the n95 seemed to be the
 
04:44:17.830 --> 04:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
specific grade and where some of the
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
mass a homeade mask that were probably
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
less than the specific grade that were
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
mandated yes and I think that was one of
 
04:44:30.190 --> 04:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
the main issues that people had a
 
04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
04:44:34.510 --> 04:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
is where and when do we start believing
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
science um I think there is written
 
04:44:39.230 --> 04:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and there may be people here
 
04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
that are going to speak on this that are
 
04:44:44.270 --> 04:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
actually scientist or doctors that will
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
tell you that um with covid the paper
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
mask that people were wearing along with
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
the homemade mask made out of you know
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere from mesh to t-shirts to Canvas
 
04:45:00.270 --> 04:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
um a lot of those didn't even stop the
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
particles of covid um being able to pass
 
04:45:05.550 --> 04:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
back and forth so it did no good
 
04:45:08.350 --> 04:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
whatsoever obviously an n95 mask would
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
have been ideal um but then again comes
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
into what rep Morse was talking about is
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
money who's paying for n95 mask who's
 
04:45:18.910 --> 04:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
watching them to make sure that they're
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
changed you know they're not getting wet
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're not getting dirty um and who's
 
04:45:26.230 --> 04:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
providing that is that taxpayers dollars
 
04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so there's a whole lot of issues that
 
04:45:32.110 --> 04:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
surround um the the type of mask warn
 
04:45:33.948 --> 04:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
04:45:33.958 --> 04:45:35.750 align:start position:0%
but yes
absolutely

04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:45:38.670 --> 04:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
Morris question she actually answered my
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the questions
 
04:45:43.150 --> 04:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:45:44.670 --> 04:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman and
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh The Honorable Arlene

04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
members of the education committee uh my
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
name is Arlene Corell I represented
 
04:46:10.480 --> 04:46:11.550 align:start position:0%
name is Arlene Corell I represented
Atkin

04:46:11.550 --> 04:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
Atkin
 
04:46:14.868 --> 04:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
in the house last term and I was a
 
04:46:18.430 --> 04:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of HB 1093 which would have
 
04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited school boards from mandating
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
maske wearing just like this bill does
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's identical as was said
 
04:46:24.480 --> 04:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
it's identical as was said
previously

04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
previously
 
04:46:29.670 --> 04:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh and that bill last year was passed by
 
04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate but the
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
former Governor vetoed it his veto
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
message cited the importance of local
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
control a concept that usually make
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
sense in our state school districts but
 
04:46:46.110 --> 04:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
this concept of local control should not
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
give school boards the authority to make
 
04:46:50.350 --> 04:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
Health decisions for
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
students in fact to do so is unethical a
 
04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
recent article in The Archives of
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
disease and childhood concluded that
 
04:47:01.150 --> 04:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
recommending child masking is
 
04:47:03.990 --> 04:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
unsupported by current scientific data
 
04:47:06.030 --> 04:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
and inconsistent with accepted ethical
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
Norms when I testified last year I had a
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
whole bunch I had done a lot of research
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through that again
 
04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
the fact is the house and the Senate
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
both passed this bill the governor
 
04:47:18.430 --> 04:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
vetoed it on the issue of local control
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
and since that time that it was passed
 
04:47:25.030 --> 04:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
um there was the release in May of the
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
shocking testimony of Anthony fouchi
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
that he had given months earlier to a
 
04:47:31.548 --> 04:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
congressional subcommittee when Dr
 
04:47:33.788 --> 04:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
fouchy was asked if he had followed any
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the numerous scientific studies
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
concerning learning loss and other
 
04:47:38.910 --> 04:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
negative effects on children wearing
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
masks he said
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
no he then admitted there are a lot of
 
04:47:47.590 --> 04:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
conflicting a lot of conflicting studies
 
04:47:50.110 --> 04:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
I still think that's up in the
 
04:47:52.868 --> 04:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
air it turns out that the
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who many had looked to for
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
guidance through the pandemic and who
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
headed an agency promoting mask use
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
hadn't been following the research
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
adequately he was further asked if there
 
04:48:06.350 --> 04:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
was ever a cost benefit analysis done on
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences of masking
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
Kids versus the protection that it would
 
04:48:14.548 --> 04:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
give them and he answered not to my
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge I am now a teacher and I'll
 
04:48:18.510 --> 04:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
tell you I'm seeing the effects of this
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
I teach middle school and these kids
 
04:48:24.548 --> 04:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
were you know under these covid measures
 
04:48:27.150 --> 04:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
the masks the lockdowns the social
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
distancing and it has scarred them I
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
mean I could bring up studies and all
 
04:48:33.150 --> 04:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
that but I'm just saying from a personal
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
perspective um in my uh role now we
 
04:48:39.430 --> 04:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
can't let this happen
 
04:48:41.830 --> 04:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
again um I know I have three minutes I'm
 
04:48:43.628 --> 04:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't digress from my testimony
 
04:48:48.868 --> 04:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
here um so uh yeah I'll skip to this
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
part during the covid pandemic we
 
04:48:52.190 --> 04:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
continuously heard the phrase follow the
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
science the science is as reflected in
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
the many conflicting studies that have
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
emerged does not provide clear
 
04:49:01.868 --> 04:49:01.878 align:start position:0%
justification for mask mandates unless
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
the face masks are proven beyond a
 
04:49:05.830 --> 04:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
shadow of a doubt to be harmless they
 
04:49:07.830 --> 04:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
should never be mandated by school
 
04:49:10.030 --> 04:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
boards the children should not be forced
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
to do something that could could
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
possibly cause them physical and
 
04:49:14.990 --> 04:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
emotional harm we're still not sure
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
about these things um local school board
 
04:49:19.548 --> 04:49:19.558 align:start position:0%
members are not MediCal experts and they
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
should not be arbitrarily mandating the
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
wearing of face masks the majority of
 
04:49:25.390 --> 04:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature agreed on this last year
 
04:49:26.990 --> 04:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
but the former Governor did
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
not um you know and I just have one
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
other thing to say I had a personal
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
experience this might go over can I have
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
an extra minute I was no all right um
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
anecdote aside then I will finish up
 
04:49:43.110 --> 04:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
please vote OTP on HB 361 and let's give
 
04:49:45.788 --> 04:49:45.798 align:start position:0%
the new governor an opportunity to sign
 
04:49:48.030 --> 04:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
this bill into law and protect our
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
children I'll take questions thank
 
04:49:52.000 --> 04:49:54.030 align:start position:0%
children I'll take questions thank
you

04:49:54.030 --> 04:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
good to see you
 
04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:06.680 --> 04:50:08.270 align:start position:0%
 
Phillips

04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
Phillips
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon uh Emily phips
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh thank you members of the committee
 
04:50:15.070 --> 04:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I was a sponsor of
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
this bill last year um and I voted for
 
04:50:19.628 --> 04:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
it previously as well I just want to
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
give you a perspective I was on the
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
school board in 2019 to 2022 when the
 
04:50:27.868 --> 04:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic happened and uh all we asked in
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
public and we among ourselves we said we
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
just wish the state would make this
 
04:50:34.548 --> 04:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
decision because from town to town you
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
know we all go to the same Market Basket
 
04:50:38.070 --> 04:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
but the the policies were all very
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
different um because the local school
 
04:50:42.030 --> 04:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
boards were setting the these mask um or
 
04:50:44.548 --> 04:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
face covering policies I'm from Fremont
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we have a pre- to8
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
school and we uh opened in person in
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
September of 2020 and we had a face
 
04:50:53.548 --> 04:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
covering policy which allowed parents to
 
04:50:55.990 --> 04:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
choose plastic face Shields or face
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
masks of any make right um so my
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
children had IEPs for speech and
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
language and other issues and so I put
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
them in plastic face Shields and they
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
went to school and I feel like I was one
 
04:51:10.390 --> 04:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the lucky ones um all the kids right
 
04:51:12.708 --> 04:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
now are very very very behind and I
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
think it might be a combination of the
 
04:51:16.628 --> 04:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
remote learning or you know the mask or
 
04:51:18.670 --> 04:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
sickness who knows but we we all know
 
04:51:20.548 --> 04:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
you guys know more than anyone um how
 
04:51:22.750 --> 04:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
behind our children are uh my children
 
04:51:25.230 --> 04:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
didn't wear masks at school and but my
 
04:51:28.150 --> 04:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
daughter specifically she's now nine is
 
04:51:28.160 --> 04:51:30.230 align:start position:0%
daughter specifically she's now nine is
so

04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:34.470 --> 04:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
emotionally stunted and um her education
 
04:51:37.110 --> 04:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
is obviously um been affected greatly by
 
04:51:39.628 --> 04:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
her peers wearing masks um she didn't
 
04:51:42.868 --> 04:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
speak at all and until uh second grade
 
04:51:45.150 --> 04:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
so um she was just I don't know if it
 
04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
was anxiety or what it was but she was
 
04:51:49.150 --> 04:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
four when the pandemic happened and uh
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
she was already very speech delayed and
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
then she just never spoke um I ended up
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
pulling her out in homeschooling um
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
after a year of being there with um all
 
04:51:59.350 --> 04:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
of her peers wearing masks all of her
 
04:52:01.390 --> 04:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
speech and language Pathologists
 
04:52:02.948 --> 04:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
covering their facei trying to teach her
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
how to speak um it very frustrating from
 
04:52:09.390 --> 04:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
a parental point of view um that people
 
04:52:10.868 --> 04:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
who are elected who are are not
 
04:52:12.670 --> 04:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
qualified to make Health decisions we
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't let our school boards decide which
 
04:52:17.510 --> 04:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines are required or other things
 
04:52:19.548 --> 04:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
but we arbitrarily allowed for the sake
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
of local control School boards to set
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
these policies and all we're asking is
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the state whether it be the elected
 
04:52:28.510 --> 04:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
legislature here or the governor to
 
04:52:30.628 --> 04:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
decide these things if it should be if
 
04:52:32.830 --> 04:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
it is warranted in future pandemics or
 
04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
what have you let you guys decide let
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
the governor decide not elected
 
04:52:39.788 --> 04:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard people we don't want the
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
burden I mean actually running for
 
04:52:43.150 --> 04:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
school board now we don't want to make
 
04:52:44.350 --> 04:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
these decisions we have a lot more
 
04:52:46.510 --> 04:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
important work to do at the local level
 
04:52:48.750 --> 04:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
than to fight with parents because it's
 
04:52:50.830 --> 04:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
very divisive right we don't want to
 
04:52:52.070 --> 04:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
fight we have other more important
 
04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
things to do let's get back to the
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
basics of Education about yes about um
 
04:52:58.470 --> 04:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know what's most important at the
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
school level so we're just asking for
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
the state to do this because it is a
 
04:53:05.110 --> 04:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
burden on school boards to set these
 
04:53:08.110 --> 04:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
policies thank you very much any
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bon thank you
 
04:53:11.548 --> 04:53:11.558 align:start position:0%
Mr CH and thank you for taking my
 
04:53:12.990 --> 04:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
question um you mentioned that you were
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
on a local board I know that the boards
 
04:53:18.548 --> 04:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
in a lot of towns in my SE area they
 
04:53:21.548 --> 04:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
relied on the um the recommendations of
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
the public health officers in the town
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
and the transmission Rats of the
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
community uh using that information to
 
04:53:31.628 --> 04:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
make the local decisions was that also
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
the case with your board sure but like I
 
04:53:36.030 --> 04:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
said we the towns right next to us were
 
04:53:37.750 --> 04:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
requiring everyone to wear face masks we
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have that policy there was one
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
moment where we mandated masks during a
 
04:53:44.708 --> 04:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
high outbreak period I want to say like
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
four or five months in and it was a twoe
 
04:53:48.430 --> 04:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
period where everyone had to wear masks
 
04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
unless you were covered by a disability
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
or an IEP um but other than that we were
 
04:53:57.070 --> 04:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
we allowed choice now most people just
 
04:54:00.670 --> 04:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
did The Masks homemade or whatnot
 
04:54:03.510 --> 04:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we we could pivot and change
 
04:54:04.910 --> 04:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
but as you know we're all shopping at
 
04:54:06.788 --> 04:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
the same places the the it's just like
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes right they travel to the next
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
yard I mean we're it's funny that one
 
04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
District right next to another District
 
04:54:14.510 --> 04:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
can arbitrarily make different decisions
 
04:54:16.708 --> 04:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
we had teachers who were trying to pull
 
04:54:18.788 --> 04:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
their kids out of their Hometown to go
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
to our school because we were physically
 
04:54:22.670 --> 04:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
open and her school wasn't but she had
 
04:54:24.548 --> 04:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
to teach at our school so it's just like
 
04:54:26.230 --> 04:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
we're all one big Community here in New
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so let's just we're not that
 
04:54:30.910 --> 04:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
big we're not Texas we're not California
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
um if this needs to be done let it be
 
04:54:34.548 --> 04:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
done on the on the executive level of
 
04:54:36.990 --> 04:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
the state not through elected
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats at our local level I mean
 
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
everything else is fine but this is a
 
04:54:42.548 --> 04:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
health ordinance and if we're talking
 
04:54:44.270 --> 04:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
about local control the AL the ultimate
 
04:54:46.430 --> 04:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
local control is app
 
04:54:50.270 --> 04:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
parents thank you see no further
 
04:54:52.270 --> 04:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for being
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
back in
 
04:55:08.548 --> 04:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.230 --> 04:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
York thank you Mr chairman and members
 
04:55:13.350 --> 04:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Gary orc I
 
04:55:16.110 --> 04:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
live in Hopkinton New
 
04:55:18.990 --> 04:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to me this was a no-brainer
 
04:55:21.670 --> 04:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislation this is passed before in
 
04:55:26.030 --> 04:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
this in this state uh I think I think if
 
04:55:30.430 --> 04:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
we all accept the premise that masks do
 
04:55:34.510 --> 04:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
not work then all these other Arguments
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
for what if this what if that all that
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't matter if they don't work
 
04:55:41.948 --> 04:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
then it's just political theater if you
 
04:55:44.110 --> 04:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
want to have people wearing
 
04:55:46.190 --> 04:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
masks it's very
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
simple um I remember testifying three
 
04:55:54.070 --> 04:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
years ago uh with uh Industrial Engineer
 
04:55:57.030 --> 04:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
specializing hygiene talking about how
 
04:55:59.708 --> 04:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
ineffective they were that was three
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
years ago U representative Morris
 
04:56:05.070 --> 04:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is a proactive thing well
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
it was proactive three years ago and
 
04:56:10.590 --> 04:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
it's high time to get this thing done so
 
04:56:13.230 --> 04:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't realize that masks don't
 
04:56:18.030 --> 04:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
work then uh maybe find another news
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
source or whatever
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
but here's here's here's a source this
 
04:56:27.628 --> 04:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
is Alan steo he writes substack which is
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
a alternate new
 
04:56:34.270 --> 04:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
source uh Alan steo from Lockdown land
 
04:56:36.910 --> 04:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
he's written a book face mask in one
 
04:56:40.548 --> 04:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
lesson pretty thick book yes uh it's out
 
04:56:43.150 --> 04:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
there his second book because his first
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
one was so popular face masks hurt kids
 
04:56:50.590 --> 04:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
and this is a much thicker book and he
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
has 43 pages of references and small
 
04:56:58.150 --> 04:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
print of why they don't work so if we
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
accept that mass don't
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much
 
04:57:08.718 --> 04:57:12.350 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much
questions

04:57:12.350 --> 04:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:31.270 --> 04:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
moris thank
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
you um hello chairman and
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
representatives my name is Samantha
 
04:57:37.708 --> 04:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
Morse and I'm the newly elected Register
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
of Deeds for marac County I'm here today
 
04:57:43.990 --> 04:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
to urge you to support HB 361 as a
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
parent I've experienced firsthand the
 
04:57:48.190 --> 04:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
Heartbreak of sending my child to school
 
04:57:50.190 --> 04:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
in tears due to mask
 
04:57:53.310 --> 04:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
mandates every day I had to reassure my
 
04:57:55.788 --> 04:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
5-year-old at the time in having just
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
started school that it would be okay and
 
04:58:00.628 --> 04:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
he could take his mask off as soon as he
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
got home my son would come home day
 
04:58:05.150 --> 04:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
after day with his mask taped to his
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
face on his cheeks um because the school
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
issued masks didn't fit properly which
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
caused some irritation uh not only in
 
04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
those areas that were taped but around
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
his ears and it made him it made it
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for him to
 
04:58:22.948 --> 04:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
breathe uh he also uh couldn't wear
 
04:58:24.750 --> 04:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
glasses comfortably because the mask
 
04:58:27.310 --> 04:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
would fog up the glasses I have that
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
issue myself too um had my child fainted
 
04:58:33.788 --> 04:58:33.798 align:start position:0%
or worst case died to the lack of air
 
04:58:35.670 --> 04:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
flow educating staff members would
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
forever have that on their conscience to
 
04:58:39.548 --> 04:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
have proper air flow the mouth and the
 
04:58:41.470 --> 04:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
nose need to be exposed
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
somehow who would have been liable in
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
this worst case
 
04:58:48.270 --> 04:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
scenario the situation became so
 
04:58:50.708 --> 04:58:50.718 align:start position:0%
distressing that we told our child to
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
only wear the mask over his mouth if he
 
04:58:55.270 --> 04:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
was having trouble breathing however
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
this was still problematic because
 
04:58:58.510 --> 04:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
children are often afraid to stand up to
 
04:59:00.670 --> 04:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
authority figures even if they're
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable they may have privileges
 
04:59:04.510 --> 04:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
taken away if they don't follow the
 
04:59:06.990 --> 04:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
rules mind you those rules or mandate
 
04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
were only applied indoors though my
 
04:59:11.350 --> 04:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
child was stillar wearing a mask on the
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
jungle gym during recess time
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
furthermore the use of masks with
 
04:59:17.430 --> 04:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
patterns that appeal to children didn't
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
change the fact that they were still
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
restricting air flow the whole
 
04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
experience was traumatic for my child
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
and did not set him up for success in
 
04:59:27.310 --> 04:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
the future for these reasons I urge you
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
to support hb36 uh HB 361 and protect
 
04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of our
 
04:59:35.868 --> 04:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
children thank you thank you very much
 
04:59:39.190 --> 04:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
for being here represent Murray thank

announced that you were the newly
 
04:59:46.350 --> 04:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
elected regist of Deeds you were but you
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
were here testifying in your personal
 
04:59:51.990 --> 04:59:52.000 align:start position:0%

from London Derry I'm testifying in
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill um as for um
 
05:00:40.110 --> 05:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
introduction I have worked in the
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
clinical microbiology laboratory for 26
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
years I participated in the infection
 
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
control task group for my Hospital
 
05:00:50.030 --> 05:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
including Ambulatory Care settings I've
 
05:00:52.990 --> 05:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
worked in research and um development
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
for Diagnostic devices for infectious
 
05:00:58.350 --> 05:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
diseases and I've worked in the Pharma
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
industry and pharmacovigilance I have
 
05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
taught clinical microbiology at the
 
05:01:04.110 --> 05:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
community college level and medical
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
ethics at the University level I have a
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
M's in
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
epidemiology when evaluating a a medical
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
intervention or public health mitigation
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
strategy for a disease whether from the
 
05:01:18.030 --> 05:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
perspective of a device like a mask or a
 
05:01:20.350 --> 05:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
public health policy the risk benefit
 
05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
analysis must be
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
considered um based on multiple studies
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
and population data the risk benefit
 
05:01:30.310 --> 05:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
analysis does not support support the
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
use of facial masks for the prevention
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
of respiratory viruses including SARS
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
cope 2 especially for children I have
 
05:01:41.230 --> 05:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
provided you the pack it's at the
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
beginning of the packet there's a link
 
05:01:43.360 --> 05:01:45.030 align:start position:0%
beginning of the packet there's a link
to

05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:47.910 --> 05:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
170 studies and journal
 
05:01:50.788 --> 05:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
articles that show that masks do not
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
work and also discuss the damage to
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
Children done by masks there's um
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
longitudinal cohort cohort um rcts and
 
05:02:04.030 --> 05:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
observational studies to support my
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
positions there was even a cohort cohort
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
study of
 
05:02:10.470 --> 05:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
kindergarteners um there's plenty in
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
your packet to look
 
05:02:16.030 --> 05:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
through um wearing masks is not a benign
 
05:02:18.470 --> 05:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
intervention and causes serious and
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
potentially long-term damage to Children
 
05:02:23.708 --> 05:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
mask wearing causes physical
 
05:02:25.548 --> 05:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
psychological and social damage to
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
children we know that masks encourage
 
05:02:29.868 --> 05:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
mouth breathing breathing in children
 
05:02:32.430 --> 05:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
which leads to facial deformities masks
 
05:02:33.910 --> 05:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
interfere with Children Learning
 
05:02:36.150 --> 05:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
socially through facial expressions
 
05:02:38.070 --> 05:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
speech learning is delayed in the very
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
young learning deficit have been
 
05:02:43.430 --> 05:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
observed in all age groups an Israeli
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
Canadian study published in cognitive
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
research in February 2022 found that
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
face masks face masks disrupt holistic
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
processing and face perception in school
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
age children masks keep other pathogens
 
05:02:59.230 --> 05:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
trapped near the mouth and nose in the
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
lungs of children these are larger
 
05:03:05.110 --> 05:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
pathogens and include bacteria mold and
 
05:03:08.190 --> 05:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
parasites bacterial counts increase
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
linearly with wearing
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
duration another important drawback of
 
05:03:15.030 --> 05:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
face masks and children may well be that
 
05:03:16.910 --> 05:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
their use could reduce the focus from
 
05:03:18.830 --> 05:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
other measures that may be more

05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
children should be able to wear a mask
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
without issue there are numerous reasons

there's questionable if you could wrap
 
05:04:48.030 --> 05:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
up I just have the but okay you can
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
always just summarize that and you can
 
05:04:52.708 --> 05:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
hand it in The Mask recommendations were
 
05:04:55.070 --> 05:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
put in into place by national and local
 
05:04:57.868 --> 05:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
public health agencies without benefit
 
05:04:59.548 --> 05:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
evidence of benefit and without
 
05:05:01.990 --> 05:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation of risks and were followed by
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
school boards and administrators who had
 
05:05:06.510 --> 05:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
no other sources or guidance we now have
 
05:05:08.990 --> 05:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
2020 hindsight and understand that
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
masking children is wrong let us correct
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
this now and not put the school boards
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the position of having to mandate bad
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
policy ever
 
05:05:19.830 --> 05:05:19.840 align:start position:0%

ago so I'm immune compromised and for
 
05:06:15.628 --> 05:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
many many years I had to deal with um
 
05:06:15.638 --> 05:06:17.030 align:start position:0%
many many years I had to deal with um
viruses

05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
viruses
 
05:06:20.590 --> 05:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
obviously uh I did choose to wear a mask
 
05:06:22.750 --> 05:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh mainly on airplanes because I wasn't
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
sure somebody sitting next to me would
 
05:06:27.310 --> 05:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
be would carry up be carrying um a virus
 
05:06:27.320 --> 05:06:28.270 align:start position:0%
be would carry up be carrying um a virus
or

05:06:28.270 --> 05:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
something uh that's kind of why I was
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
kind of shocked by the response when
 
05:06:35.190 --> 05:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
covid came along because people like me
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
have been dealing with with this forever
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
I mean flu comes along I have to be
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
careful you know those kind of things my
 
05:06:43.470 --> 05:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
doctor my nephologist really emphasized
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
handwashing not even masks I just chose
 
05:06:48.350 --> 05:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
to wear one on the plane sometimes if it
 
05:06:50.070 --> 05:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
was during cold and flu
 
05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
season um so when this occurred you know
 
05:06:56.070 --> 05:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
I was very sympathetic to parents who
 
05:06:58.430 --> 05:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
wanted their kids masked you know we
 
05:07:00.548 --> 05:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
didn't know I mean I'm listening to this
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
going holy crap why am I wearing a mask
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm very good about washing my
 
05:07:06.390 --> 05:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
hands I get off the airplane and it
 
05:07:08.590 --> 05:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
didn't matter if I wore a mask cuz if I
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
pick something up on the air take the
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
mask off and it's on my hand doesn't
 
05:07:14.270 --> 05:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
matter that I was wearing a mask so I'm
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic though to people who
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
wear and I don't I don't think they
 
05:07:19.070 --> 05:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
should be shamed I think if a parent
 
05:07:21.390 --> 05:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
wants their child in mask so be
 
05:07:23.628 --> 05:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
it um
 
05:07:28.270 --> 05:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
but the the mandates the force because I
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
thought well I never forced anybody on a
 
05:07:33.788 --> 05:07:33.798 align:start position:0%
plane to wear a mask I chose to wear one
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
and I did that for years so I wasn't
 
05:07:38.910 --> 05:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
sure why this was being you know
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
mandated in this way so he supported the
 
05:07:42.750 --> 05:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
parents who on their children mask but
 
05:07:44.270 --> 05:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
then I was also hearing from parents who
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
were like you know my child's
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
neurodiverse I can't get up a mask on
 
05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
their on their face
 
05:07:54.670 --> 05:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
um emotional issues that I was not
 
05:07:57.230 --> 05:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with because I can put one on
 
05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
but then I'm hearing from them thinking
 
05:08:01.390 --> 05:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
this is this is serious like some of
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
these parents cannot force their kids to
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
do this I can remember with my son the
 
05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
tag in the back of his shirt he couldn't
 
05:08:08.510 --> 05:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
walk around with a tag in the back of
 
05:08:11.110 --> 05:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
his shirt so imagine putting it on his
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
face um
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
so I think it's just common sense to let
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
the parents basically decide I do I mean
 
05:08:24.430 --> 05:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
I know that that the governor would
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
still have you know the the position to
 
05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
require mandates but Schoolboard members
 
05:08:33.708 --> 05:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
don't have a medical background I would
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
assume that a a governor or or a state
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
body would be bringing in medical advice
 
05:08:42.350 --> 05:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
on this I get my medical advice from my
 
05:08:44.430 --> 05:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
doctor I'm not going to the school board
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
and having them tell me if I should mask
 
05:08:48.510 --> 05:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
my child or not and to be honest with
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
you I might have masked my child for a
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
little while during covid but that would
 
05:08:54.270 --> 05:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
have been my choice working with the
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
doctor I would have asked the doctor or
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
my daughter who is a pediatric nurse I
 
05:09:00.670 --> 05:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
would asked her you know is this
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
necessary these kind of things um it's
 
05:09:06.030 --> 05:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
three minutes up okay then I'm going to
 
05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
just stop right there okay okay great
 
05:09:11.190 --> 05:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Miss
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
bfield thank you see none thank you very
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:24.628 --> 05:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
freedan Mr chairman committee members
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman I live in Bridgewater I
 
05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
speak in support of this bill um of
 
05:09:31.390 --> 05:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
course it should be up to the parents
 
05:09:35.230 --> 05:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
not school bureaucrats who like 99% of
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
the time they just defer to the health
 
05:09:41.430 --> 05:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
authori so when they say Lo local
 
05:09:43.948 --> 05:09:43.958 align:start position:0%
control it wasn't that they're just
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
deferring to the you know D HHS or
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they didn't uh really they
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
didn't know any more than we did so our
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
experience in SAU 4 it was a disaster
 
05:10:00.750 --> 05:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
for close to a year we fought and there'
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
be the people who wanted them again it's
 
05:10:05.310 --> 05:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
not the mask it's the mask mandate
 
05:10:07.110 --> 05:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's the problem and the people who
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
wanted the Mandate they sat on one ins
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
side of the auditorium with their masks
 
05:10:13.788 --> 05:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
on and they cited all the studies saying
 
05:10:16.510 --> 05:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
that the mask masks make a difference
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
and then the anti-maskers we sat on the
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
other side because we didn't want to
 
05:10:22.548 --> 05:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
infect them we had our own studies
 
05:10:24.350 --> 05:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
saying that they they're not effective
 
05:10:25.830 --> 05:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
or there's it's
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
inconclusive spent almost a whole school
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
year I believe till about March finally
 
05:10:34.830 --> 05:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
the Mandate was dropped and then and for
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
all that time fighting about a bunch of
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
nonsense rather than worrying about a
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
raising our academic uh literacy of the
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
kids that's what the schools are
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be for we were fighting
 
05:10:48.590 --> 05:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
about this and then soon as the Mandate
 
05:10:51.190 --> 05:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
was dropped uh hardly anybody wore a
 
05:10:53.948 --> 05:10:53.958 align:start position:0%
mask after that nobody cared if you did
 
05:10:56.510 --> 05:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
so it was a big waste of time and I
 
05:10:58.990 --> 05:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
might add this might be a good argument
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
for having uh more uh access to efas and
 
05:11:04.430 --> 05:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
school choice because this doesn't
 
05:11:06.590 --> 05:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
affect private schools so for those
 
05:11:08.990 --> 05:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
parents who want to make everybody wear
 
05:11:12.708 --> 05:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
a askk they could choose a school that a
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
private school that would have that
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
mandate and that'd be fine for them that
 
05:11:19.150 --> 05:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
everybody more choices better for
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
everybody maybe we can stick to the bill
 
05:11:24.310 --> 05:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah so um I I support the bill
 
05:11:27.390 --> 05:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
and let's not go through this mess again
 
05:11:29.788 --> 05:11:29.798 align:start position:0%
and and not have any mask mandate keep
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
it optional and that's it thank you
 
05:11:34.750 --> 05:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%

had to plug that in um I'm also a parent
 
05:12:09.470 --> 05:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
and a teacher of 15 years and going into
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
teaching y all knew you were going into
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
the petri dish um you were going to
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
catch everything and anything uh if you
 
05:12:18.548 --> 05:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
did not know that you had poor schooling
 
05:12:21.390 --> 05:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
going into education um my first two
 
05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
three years of teaching we caught
 
05:12:26.190 --> 05:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
everything um my second year of teaching
 
05:12:28.230 --> 05:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
chickenpox went through the school what
 
05:12:29.868 --> 05:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
are you going to do nothing else you can
 
05:12:31.390 --> 05:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
do but clean the desks and make sure the
 
05:12:33.670 --> 05:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
kids are you know coming to school and
 
05:12:35.548 --> 05:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden like my tummy itches off
 
05:12:38.788 --> 05:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
they went to the nurse um through Co my
 
05:12:42.190 --> 05:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
daughter has um a hearing issue and uh
 
05:12:44.948 --> 05:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
it was hard enough uh to get the adults
 
05:12:46.628 --> 05:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
the teachers to wear the clear mask so
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
she could see their face um she needs to
 
05:12:52.830 --> 05:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
read their lips and um teachers refused
 
05:12:55.868 --> 05:12:55.878 align:start position:0%
um so that impaired her ability to learn
 
05:12:57.310 --> 05:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh and it didn't matter if it was in our
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
504 plan or not nobody listen um in
 
05:13:04.230 --> 05:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
kinderg I taught kindergarten for 5
 
05:13:06.548 --> 05:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
years they need to see your face they
 
05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
need to see what your face is doing what
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
your lips are doing that's how how you
 
05:13:11.310 --> 05:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
taught letter sounds look the way my
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
mouth is look where my tongue is look
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
what my tongue is doing I you can't do
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
that with a mask on um and then you know
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
as far as a teacher I mean I was
 
05:13:23.788 --> 05:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
pregnant with my first child in teaching
 
05:13:25.708 --> 05:13:25.718 align:start position:0%
and I had a parent that came in and said
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness my kid has fists disease
 
05:13:30.990 --> 05:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
and as people that have had children and
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
been in the teaching field and know
 
05:13:34.190 --> 05:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
fists disease is very prevalent in the
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
school district and I knew that too um
 
05:13:38.230 --> 05:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
thankfully I was far enough in my
 
05:13:40.590 --> 05:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy that affect me but that's a
 
05:13:43.868 --> 05:13:43.878 align:start position:0%
risk I took I knew that going in um you
 
05:13:46.110 --> 05:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
know just be aware I mean when I hear
 
05:13:47.788 --> 05:13:47.798 align:start position:0%
people talking about people in the
 
05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
medical field oh they didn't know yeah
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
you do you know you're going to get in
 
05:13:52.150 --> 05:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
contact with everything and anything you
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to walk through
 
05:13:54.910 --> 05:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
the door and as a teacher you don't know
 
05:13:57.190 --> 05:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
what's going to walk through the door um
 
05:13:59.830 --> 05:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
and as far as measles three cases is um
 
05:14:01.628 --> 05:14:01.638 align:start position:0%
considered an epidemic my college in
 
05:14:04.110 --> 05:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
1992 had our best Quil team got the
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
measles from another team and that's
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
when they decided to give everyone a
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
second shot of MMR
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and I oh and then my finally my
 
05:14:14.430 --> 05:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
oldest child uh they had chickenpox when
 
05:14:16.150 --> 05:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
she was in high school went through and
 
05:14:18.310 --> 05:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
she's type 1 diabetic so autoimmune
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
compromised and so we kept her there and
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
I said well we'll see if the vaccine
 
05:14:24.750 --> 05:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
worked or not and if and it she didn't
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
catch it but if she didn't we would just
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
deal with it so you know that as a
 
05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:29.558 align:start position:0%

has come forward and it has passed uh
 
05:15:25.070 --> 05:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
twice both bodies and here we are again
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
so three times needs to be a charm um my
 
05:15:31.390 --> 05:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
family suffered
 
05:15:34.510 --> 05:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
greatly my daughter has anxiety could
 
05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
never wear a mask tried to get an
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
exemption from her from from her uh her
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
therapist it didn't matter it was it was
 
05:15:48.708 --> 05:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
like disabilities just didn't exist
 
05:15:54.830 --> 05:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
anymore um and I actually um left public
 
05:15:58.830 --> 05:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
school to go to a private school and
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
they were just as ridiculous so after
 
05:16:04.948 --> 05:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
about 3 months had to pull out my kids
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
because a teacher threatened my daughter
 
05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
to say there would be dire consequen
 
05:16:13.390 --> 05:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
put her hand on her face and pulled the
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
mask over her
 
05:16:19.470 --> 05:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
nose I have stories that could go on for
 
05:16:20.750 --> 05:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
for hours and you don't want to hear
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
them so let's just get this done um it
 
05:16:29.430 --> 05:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
needs to happen it it severely harmed my
 
05:16:32.190 --> 05:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
oldest daughter in so many ways
 
05:16:33.868 --> 05:16:33.878 align:start position:0%
disruptions in her
 
05:16:37.868 --> 05:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
education and um and created her level
 
05:16:40.628 --> 05:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
of anxiety just went through the roof
 
05:16:44.670 --> 05:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
and um so for all of those reasons
 
05:16:48.628 --> 05:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
parents know their kids best and um and
 
05:16:52.110 --> 05:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
if there is some sort of Statewide
 
05:16:55.230 --> 05:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
emergency and the governor has that um
 
05:16:58.350 --> 05:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
perview to do that that's fine but
 
05:17:00.990 --> 05:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
school board members are they're not
 
05:17:02.788 --> 05:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
doctors and they're not parents of your
 
05:17:05.430 --> 05:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
children and um please do the right
 
05:17:07.470 --> 05:17:07.480 align:start position:0%

05:17:51.390 --> 05:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
neglected should be a protected
 
05:17:54.548 --> 05:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
class and putting a mask over someone's
 
05:17:58.590 --> 05:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
mouth when they're a child a traumatized
 
05:18:04.030 --> 05:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
child should never ever ever be
 
05:18:08.310 --> 05:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
okay the kind of feeling that an adult
 
05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
gets when they see a
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
child like that should put something in
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
your heart that says that is not
 
05:18:21.190 --> 05:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay the Department of Education the
 
05:18:23.948 --> 05:18:23.958 align:start position:0%
school boards they understand
 
05:18:27.070 --> 05:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
academics let's put it back where it
 
05:18:29.830 --> 05:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
belongs there isn't a there isn't a
 
05:18:32.350 --> 05:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
social service person
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
alive that understands the importance of
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
valuing an abused and neglected child
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
and masking is never okay thank you and
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%

you
 
05:21:12.070 --> 05:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
are thank you Mr chair and members of
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I'm Kristen
 
05:21:16.590 --> 05:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
Noble I represent Hillsboro District 2
 
05:21:19.510 --> 05:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.070 --> 05:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
Bedford so how did this bill come
 
05:21:27.150 --> 05:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
about last term we had a work session um
 
05:21:29.430 --> 05:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
in this committee on mental health and
 
05:21:32.910 --> 05:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
it prompted me to do some research on
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
Mental Health in schools and that is
 
05:21:37.868 --> 05:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
when I discovered school-based Health
 
05:21:37.878 --> 05:21:39.948 align:start position:0%
when I discovered school-based Health
Centers

05:21:39.948 --> 05:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
Centers
 
05:21:41.750 --> 05:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
this would be like having a doctor's
 
05:21:44.670 --> 05:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
office right in the school offering
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Mental Health Services
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive health schoolwide health
 
05:21:52.990 --> 05:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
education immunizations laboratory
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
services substance abuse services and
 
05:21:58.990 --> 05:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
more it does seem to vary from state to
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
state um what is offered for
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
services who would have access to the
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
Health Center mostly
 
05:22:10.590 --> 05:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
students but I have also seen staff um
 
05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
but could also be student families or
 
05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
community members and I think it
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
probably depends on how close they are
 
05:22:21.110 --> 05:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
to the Community Schools model this is
 
05:22:24.030 --> 05:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
something that the CDC had promoted
 
05:22:26.548 --> 05:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
called whole school whole Community
 
05:22:29.548 --> 05:22:29.558 align:start position:0%
whole child where your local public
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
school would serve the entire Community
 
05:22:35.470 --> 05:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
such as offering adult education classes
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
or health care
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
services School based Health Centers
 
05:22:41.310 --> 05:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
have been around for
 
05:22:44.070 --> 05:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
decades there are thousands across the
 
05:22:46.868 --> 05:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
country in New Hampshire I believe we
 
05:22:49.548 --> 05:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
have four that have started I know in
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester um they're very focused on
 
05:22:55.628 --> 05:22:55.638 align:start position:0%
mental health and I'm not sure if the
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
grant they just received is um if they
 
05:23:03.390 --> 05:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
are planning to expand on those
 
05:23:06.150 --> 05:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
Services uh I'm not sure what the others
 
05:23:09.310 --> 05:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
in the state are offering
 
05:23:12.510 --> 05:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
um how are these Health Centers funded
 
05:23:15.390 --> 05:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
typically they start with grants in
 
05:23:17.548 --> 05:23:17.558 align:start position:0%
December the US Department of Education
 
05:23:19.830 --> 05:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
was offering grants for districts to set
 
05:23:22.990 --> 05:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
up full service Community
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
Schools I don't know what the details of
 
05:23:28.070 --> 05:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
those grants are the rest of the funding
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
also seems to vary from state to
 
05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
state what is common in all I believe is
 
05:23:37.310 --> 05:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
that they're billing Medicaid and
 
05:23:39.230 --> 05:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
private insurance where they can and
 
05:23:42.070 --> 05:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
then supplementing with State funding
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
Local District funding and sometimes
 
05:23:48.670 --> 05:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
Foundation this bill is aimed at
 
05:23:53.470 --> 05:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
stopping our schools from turning into
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
05:23:57.788 --> 05:23:57.798 align:start position:0%
Centers why would I want to do that
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
healthc care is not the purpose of our
 
05:24:02.670 --> 05:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
Public Schools our schools are for
 
05:24:02.680 --> 05:24:04.230 align:start position:0%
Public Schools our schools are for
educating

05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
educating
 
05:24:07.070 --> 05:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
children I'm very concerned about the
 
05:24:10.628 --> 05:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
funding when grant grant money runs out
 
05:24:12.628 --> 05:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
that's when things usually fall to the
 
05:24:15.750 --> 05:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers too many Granite Staters
 
05:24:17.470 --> 05:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
have hit their limit where property
 
05:24:18.910 --> 05:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
taxes are
 
05:24:22.230 --> 05:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
concerned mistakes could happen and it
 
05:24:24.628 --> 05:24:24.638 align:start position:0%
is a concern of children having medical
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
appointments without a parent
 
05:24:30.830 --> 05:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
present Tiffany cck from um Health
 
05:24:33.990 --> 05:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
Freedom Maine sent me some testimony she
 
05:24:36.150 --> 05:24:36.160 align:start position:0%

05:24:37.590 --> 05:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to share it with you because
 
05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%

Centers and the State's goal is to open
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
another 15 in the next 18 months most of
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
the clinics currently in Maine were
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
approved and put in quietly under the
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
cover of covid lockdowns there are
 
05:25:21.990 --> 05:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of parents in Maine right now
 
05:25:24.030 --> 05:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
that still have no idea that a third
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
party Medical Clinic is in their child's
 
05:25:30.510 --> 05:25:30.520 align:start position:0%

05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
across Maine in high schools and in
 
05:25:41.548 --> 05:25:41.558 align:start position:0%
elementary schools some districts are
 
05:25:43.830 --> 05:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
even opening them in both Elementary and
 
05:25:46.110 --> 05:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
high schools these clinics are not part
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
of or being held accountable to the
 
05:25:50.750 --> 05:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
school districts rather they are operate
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
operating as auxiliary clinics managed
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
by Major Hospital
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
networks the services offered can range
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
from Minor Medical Care to fully
 
05:26:03.030 --> 05:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
functional Diagnostic and prescription
 
05:26:05.548 --> 05:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
capabilities even the approach to a
 
05:26:08.310 --> 05:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
specific service can vary for example
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
all Clin all clinics offer sexual health
 
05:26:14.150 --> 05:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
and reproductive Health Services which
 
05:26:16.270 --> 05:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
include birth control
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
prescriptions however we have found
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
several clinics
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
offering nlex neplexon implants and IUD
 
05:26:27.310 --> 05:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
birth control devices without even
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
parental knowledge let alone
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
consent because of the legal support and
 
05:26:36.430 --> 05:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
individual advocacy we offer families we
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
have had a front row seat to the harm
 
05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
being done as a result of these clinics
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
in fact we are actively pursuing
 
05:26:45.190 --> 05:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
litigation in one situation where a
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
young lady was being seen treated
 
05:26:50.470 --> 05:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosed and medicated at school
 
05:26:52.990 --> 05:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
without parental knowledge for almost 3
 
05:26:55.470 --> 05:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
years when this girl's friend group
 
05:26:57.190 --> 05:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
decided to go to the clinic and get
 
05:26:59.708 --> 05:26:59.718 align:start position:0%
birth control she felt compelled to go
 
05:27:02.590 --> 05:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
along so she wouldn't be the odd one out
 
05:27:04.750 --> 05:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
that first year she was given oral birth
 
05:27:07.590 --> 05:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
control she was not however educated
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
about the birth control she was being
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
given at all not even the basic informed
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
consent that is standard care she was
 
05:27:17.788 --> 05:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
simply given pills and told to take them
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
the following year she was preemptively
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
directed by the clinic staff to choose
 
05:27:26.830 --> 05:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
between an NE plexon implant or an IUD
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
she chose the implant several of her
 
05:27:32.430 --> 05:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
friends however chose iuds after being
 
05:27:34.548 --> 05:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
given the implant she was told to
 
05:27:38.350 --> 05:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
continue oral birth control as well
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
when she asked why she was told it would
 
05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
regulate her periods even though
 
05:27:45.430 --> 05:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
irregular periods was not something she
 
05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
was being seen for on top of this the
 
05:27:51.430 --> 05:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
clinic was also providing Plan B pills
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
prophylactically which she took on a
 
05:27:55.628 --> 05:27:55.638 align:start position:0%
couple different occasions as directed
 
05:27:58.270 --> 05:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
by the clinic so by the time the next
 
05:28:00.270 --> 05:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
school year started this girl had been
 
05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
on multiple birth controls her hormones
 
05:28:05.110 --> 05:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
were wrecked and she was showing
 
05:28:07.708 --> 05:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
symptoms of such yet when she went back
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
to the Clinic to explain what was going
 
05:28:11.910 --> 05:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
on they simply diagnosed her with
 
05:28:14.190 --> 05:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
clinical depression and prescribed her
 
05:28:14.200 --> 05:28:15.628 align:start position:0%
clinical depression and prescribed her
an

05:28:15.628 --> 05:28:15.638 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
SSRI maybe maybe could concentrate on
 
05:28:18.120 --> 05:28:21.670 align:start position:0%
SSRI maybe maybe could concentrate on
the

05:28:21.670 --> 05:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
bill okay it this is what was going on
 
05:28:27.470 --> 05:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
in school based Health Clinic thank
 
05:28:30.350 --> 05:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
you and if you could if that's written
 
05:28:41.990 --> 05:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:44.110 --> 05:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
okay so at the risk of stating the
 
05:28:46.948 --> 05:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
obvious this is dangerous what is worse
 
05:28:50.190 --> 05:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
is that we are pursuing litigation we
 
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
are finding just how unaccountable these
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
clinics are which just amplifies the
 
05:28:58.788 --> 05:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
danger the family in our case was lucky
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
while harm was done it can mostly be
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
healed in time and proper with time and
 
05:29:05.910 --> 05:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
proper treatment but what happens to the
 
05:29:08.830 --> 05:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
family who isn't so lucky what happens
 
05:29:10.430 --> 05:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
when a young girl suffers a serious
 
05:29:13.190 --> 05:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
injury from an IUD no one knows she got
 
05:29:15.150 --> 05:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
or to a young boy who dies after being
 
05:29:17.430 --> 05:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
prescribed medication that he couldn't
 
05:29:20.430 --> 05:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
take so I'll stop there and and share
 
05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
that with with the committee
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
so if you take a look at the um language
 
05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill it was my intention to come
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
today with a with an
 
05:29:36.868 --> 05:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
amendment um however I probably would
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
have have drafted like five amendments
 
05:29:41.310 --> 05:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
by now so I figured I'll wait and see
 
05:29:43.310 --> 05:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
what what comes out of the hearing and
 
05:29:44.510 --> 05:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
just do
 
05:29:50.670 --> 05:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
one um so the when I was putting in the
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill I W I was confused about if this
 
05:29:57.670 --> 05:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
was going to stop the the normal things
 
05:29:59.190 --> 05:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
that happen in school with like the
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
vision and the hearing and the things
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
that they've been doing for forever um
 
05:30:08.070 --> 05:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
or or any other um screenings
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
but that's they're actually screenings
 
05:30:12.430 --> 05:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a diagnostic test so it
 
05:30:15.230 --> 05:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be stopped by this
 
05:30:19.430 --> 05:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill um when when Diana Fenton came in
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
and gave us that little training on on
 
05:30:24.270 --> 05:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
the law book she had pointed out a
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
section in the law as a good example of
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
how to exclude things or to say this um
 
05:30:36.310 --> 05:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
this should not be meant to include so I
 
05:30:38.310 --> 05:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
will have a list I actually have a
 
05:30:40.830 --> 05:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
couple of lists um I asked the special
 
05:30:44.830 --> 05:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
ed director um in my town if she could
 
05:30:46.628 --> 05:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
provide me a list with all the things
 
05:30:48.868 --> 05:30:48.878 align:start position:0%
that they're doing for screening so that
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
I make sure everything is
 
05:30:50.878 --> 05:30:52.390 align:start position:0%
I make sure everything is
covered

05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
covered
 
05:30:56.030 --> 05:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and also Becky Wilson has he she sent
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
too the first thing that um people were
 
05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about when they read this is
 
05:31:10.030 --> 05:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
that their school nurse would not be
 
05:31:11.868 --> 05:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
able to do their
 
05:31:11.878 --> 05:31:13.470 align:start position:0%
able to do their
job

05:31:13.470 --> 05:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:31:13.480 --> 05:31:15.548 align:start position:0%
job
um

05:31:15.548 --> 05:31:15.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
the pro diagnostic testing surgical
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
procedures or prescribing pharmaceutical
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
drugs is not within the scope of
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
practice of an RN and I believe that
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
most School nurses are
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
RN's and the other thing around the
 
05:31:36.150 --> 05:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
nurse is um you know they they are
 
05:31:38.948 --> 05:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
administering medication
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
diabetes was brought up a lot and
 
05:31:47.110 --> 05:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
so they they'd be testing um their blood
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
sugar during the day potentially and so
 
05:31:51.628 --> 05:31:51.638 align:start position:0%
people were concerned that they wouldn't
 
05:31:54.788 --> 05:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
be able to do that the diagnostic
 
05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
testing was actually already done by The
 
05:31:59.628 --> 05:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
Physician to come up with the diagnosis
 
05:32:02.670 --> 05:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
of diabetes so the nurse at that point
 
05:32:05.230 --> 05:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
is really just following what's from the
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
doctor's plan she's doing it's really
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
just an assessment and then she would
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
adjust the child's insulin if if needed
 
05:32:20.670 --> 05:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:25.270 --> 05:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.470 --> 05:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
else lots of things came up um taking
 
05:32:33.150 --> 05:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
temperature blood pressure
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
um you know all of those things are are
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
part of a a nursing assessment so the
 
05:32:42.750 --> 05:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
the normal things that she would do in
 
05:32:46.270 --> 05:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
school it's an assessment and then that
 
05:32:49.708 --> 05:32:49.718 align:start position:0%
assessment leads to a nursing diagnosis
 
05:32:51.948 --> 05:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
which is not a
 
05:32:55.990 --> 05:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis so she um the school nurse is
 
05:32:58.510 --> 05:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
is covered and I did so I heard from
 
05:33:00.270 --> 05:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
someone who was really concerned about
 
05:33:02.948 --> 05:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
that and she had emailed me back a few
 
05:33:06.270 --> 05:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
days later and said nope my you're good
 
05:33:08.070 --> 05:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
my school nurse says it's fine and she
 
05:33:10.470 --> 05:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
has gave me a whole explanation of stuff
 
05:33:12.310 --> 05:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
which I can share with everybody and
 
05:33:14.190 --> 05:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
there's actually online testimony as
 
05:33:16.470 --> 05:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
well from from a school nurse that's it
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
just doesn't touch me at
 
05:33:21.310 --> 05:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
all so
 
05:33:23.788 --> 05:33:23.798 align:start position:0%
there I definitely need to change some
 
05:33:26.990 --> 05:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
wording um I am considering changing
 
05:33:31.708 --> 05:33:31.718 align:start position:0%
diagnostic test to perhaps some medical
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um and then
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
also probably changing
 
05:33:40.150 --> 05:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
School physician because they're not
 
05:33:43.750 --> 05:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually employed by the
 
05:33:43.760 --> 05:33:45.708 align:start position:0%
actually employed by the
school

05:33:45.708 --> 05:33:45.718 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:33:48.830 --> 05:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that's about it so really
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:33:53.390 --> 05:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
all based on trying to stop our schools
 
05:33:55.948 --> 05:33:55.958 align:start position:0%
from turning into Health Care
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
Centers happy to take any questions
 
05:33:58.718 --> 05:33:59.510 align:start position:0%
Centers happy to take any questions
thank

05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:34:01.670 --> 05:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
you represent of
 
05:34:03.628 --> 05:34:03.638 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you for taking my question
 
05:34:05.948 --> 05:34:05.958 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious a lot of your testimony
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
was about Main in New Hampshire you said
 
05:34:10.270 --> 05:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
there were four centers right now did
 
05:34:13.628 --> 05:34:13.638 align:start position:0%
you say that one Manchester and is that
 
05:34:16.590 --> 05:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
I so Becky Wilson told me there was one
 
05:34:16.600 --> 05:34:17.430 align:start position:0%
I so Becky Wilson told me there was one
in

05:34:17.430 --> 05:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
Newport I I don't know exactly what the
 
05:34:22.868 --> 05:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
services are that they're providing I
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
think there might be one in Nashua and I
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
forget the fourth but I think there
 
05:34:29.868 --> 05:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
might be somebody here that knows follow
 
05:34:29.878 --> 05:34:31.030 align:start position:0%
might be somebody here that knows follow
up

05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:34:33.628 --> 05:34:33.638 align:start position:0%
follow are they experiencing any of
 
05:34:36.510 --> 05:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
those your concerns in this bill I have
 
05:34:38.190 --> 05:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
not heard but
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
this bill is more preventative
 
05:34:46.830 --> 05:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
than thank you further questions see
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
none oh I see representative Freeman has
 
05:34:52.230 --> 05:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
a question thank you um Mr chair and
 
05:34:54.470 --> 05:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative for taking
 
05:34:58.110 --> 05:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
my question so based on this bill and
 
05:34:59.788 --> 05:34:59.798 align:start position:0%
some of the conversations I've had with
 
05:35:03.030 --> 05:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
people concerning this bill
 
05:35:06.910 --> 05:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
um do you know if um every time you were
 
05:35:08.750 --> 05:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
your child visit it's a doctor that you
 
05:35:11.510 --> 05:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
have to sign a form that let you know
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
that what your hippo rights are and you
 
05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
given them permission to the insurance
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
company to build your insurance and
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're responsible for any money after
 
05:35:22.948 --> 05:35:22.958 align:start position:0%
that do you know if these Community
 
05:35:26.830 --> 05:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
School centers have the same type of um
 
05:35:28.070 --> 05:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say paperwork but the
 
05:35:30.990 --> 05:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
same type of administrative
 
05:35:33.830 --> 05:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
tasks thank you for the
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
question there they do get um there is
 
05:35:42.030 --> 05:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
Parental con consent I think um because
 
05:35:44.868 --> 05:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
from state to state especially for like
 
05:35:47.708 --> 05:35:47.718 align:start position:0%
birth control and maybe substance abuse
 
05:35:52.190 --> 05:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
Services I think that the the the age is
 
05:35:55.548 --> 05:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
is different from state to state
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
um but yes parental consent is part of
 
05:36:02.670 --> 05:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
it I don't know if they're doing one or
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
if they're doing it for every
 
05:36:08.110 --> 05:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
service thank you MH
 
05:36:10.830 --> 05:36:10.840 align:start position:0%

05:36:11.788 --> 05:36:11.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:36:13.548 --> 05:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
question so I'm curious how are these
 
05:36:15.990 --> 05:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
set up how does the school district and
 
05:36:18.150 --> 05:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
the health care center how does that
 
05:36:19.868 --> 05:36:19.878 align:start position:0%
healthc care center get into the school
 
05:36:21.948 --> 05:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
do they like ask a school board to go to
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
the town well how does that
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
work I actually don't um I'm not sure
 
05:36:31.150 --> 05:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
how it comes about okay I've never heard
 
05:36:33.990 --> 05:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
of it that's like yeah oh yeah thank
 
05:36:36.350 --> 05:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
you represent B
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
bony oh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:36:40.830 --> 05:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so these
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
community health centers that are set up
 
05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the schools the people that work for
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
the community health centers are these
 
05:36:51.788 --> 05:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
people School Personnel that work there
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
no it's
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
um typically they're partnering with
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
like a a a health care um company or
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
facility followup yes um so the the
 
05:37:05.830 --> 05:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
place where this bill is located is
 
05:37:10.030 --> 05:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
under School Health mhm um so I I
 
05:37:11.548 --> 05:37:11.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think that this would have
 
05:37:14.590 --> 05:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
anything to do with schools if there not
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
the school district providing the
 
05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
services it's happening within the
 
05:37:25.948 --> 05:37:25.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
section r s thank you um thank you for
 
05:37:32.590 --> 05:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question in in one of my um
 
05:37:34.548 --> 05:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
previous jobs I worked for an
 
05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
organization that provided Community
 
05:37:37.948 --> 05:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
Health Services
 
05:37:41.150 --> 05:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
which included um offering dental care
 
05:37:43.350 --> 05:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
for children who didn't have the means
 
05:37:45.470 --> 05:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
to get dental care and so they would
 
05:37:47.150 --> 05:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
partner with school districts to be able
 
05:37:48.910 --> 05:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
to help provide Dental Care to those
 
05:37:52.350 --> 05:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
children at school with yes there is and
 
05:37:54.110 --> 05:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
please don't interrupt me that's not
 
05:37:57.948 --> 05:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
your purview it's you um so my question
 
05:38:00.750 --> 05:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
is how this bill would impact
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
organizations like that that are going
 
05:38:04.868 --> 05:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
in at the behest of the community who
 
05:38:06.868 --> 05:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
are saying to these Health Centers and
 
05:38:08.350 --> 05:38:08.360 align:start position:0%
health organiz we don't have the
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
resources to provide this care for our
 
05:38:13.230 --> 05:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
children you have that ability how would
 
05:38:15.310 --> 05:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
this make it so that those Partnerships
 
05:38:17.948 --> 05:38:17.958 align:start position:0%
would no longer be able to
 
05:38:20.708 --> 05:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
occur I only just found out that that
 
05:38:22.750 --> 05:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
was going on
 
05:38:24.990 --> 05:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think that's something I need to
 
05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
think about
 
05:38:30.990 --> 05:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe add to the
 
05:38:33.430 --> 05:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
amendment I I don't I'm not sure is it
 
05:38:37.910 --> 05:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
only cleanings that they're doing um m
 
05:38:40.868 --> 05:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
yes respond thank you well yeah you can
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
ask the questions and she can do the
 
05:38:42.120 --> 05:38:44.708 align:start position:0%
ask the questions and she can do the
answers

05:38:44.708 --> 05:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:47.070 --> 05:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
right to clarify I could have asked you
 
05:38:51.708 --> 05:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
they they provided uh dental care and
 
05:38:53.350 --> 05:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
and they would reach out to parents if
 
05:38:55.590 --> 05:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
there was more than just a a screening
 
05:38:57.590 --> 05:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
or cleaning needed but so that was one
 
05:38:59.868 --> 05:38:59.878 align:start position:0%
of their purposes as a Community Health
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
Organization and so I'm wondering about
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
the possibility of blocking community
 
05:39:05.190 --> 05:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
health organizations being able to
 
05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.468 --> 05:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
Community uh represent Freeman did you
 
05:39:15.910 --> 05:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
have a question I did thank you Mr chair
 
05:39:19.110 --> 05:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
um representative have you heard about
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
the new school that they will be
 
05:39:23.910 --> 05:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
building in Manchester and um what one
 
05:39:26.230 --> 05:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
of the functions of that new elementary
 
05:39:29.070 --> 05:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:32.788 --> 05:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
be I know that they were awarded a grant
 
05:39:36.628 --> 05:39:36.638 align:start position:0%
I think in December so I would assume
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
that it would be they would have a
 
05:39:43.548 --> 05:39:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:47.430 --> 05:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
Center follow follow would you believe
 
05:39:49.628 --> 05:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
um representative that um the new school
 
05:39:52.230 --> 05:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
didn't get a grant actually but um that
 
05:39:53.910 --> 05:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
one of the functions of that new
 
05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
elementary school would be uh to be a
 
05:39:58.628 --> 05:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
community health center yes I would
 
05:40:01.628 --> 05:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
believe thank you
 
05:40:04.548 --> 05:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
um Just for future reference you know
 
05:40:07.468 --> 05:40:07.478 align:start position:0%
this is to solicit testimony so really
 
05:40:10.430 --> 05:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
what would you believe is not a a valid
 
05:40:12.910 --> 05:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
question in in Community Committee
 
05:40:19.230 --> 05:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:22.910 --> 05:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
Morris okay
 
05:40:25.628 --> 05:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
um any further questions thank you very
 
05:40:25.638 --> 05:40:26.868 align:start position:0%
um any further questions thank you very
much

05:40:26.868 --> 05:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:40:33.600 --> 05:40:33.610 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:33.610 --> 05:40:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:40:43.910 --> 05:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:46.270 --> 05:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman committee members Aubrey
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
Friedman Liv in Bridgewater I speak in
 
05:40:51.390 --> 05:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
support of this bill too uh even hearing
 
05:40:55.390 --> 05:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
that the uh if I could ask you to pause
 
05:40:57.230 --> 05:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
for one second we'll do three minutes
 
05:40:59.150 --> 05:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
for this hearing as well if you would
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'll make it quick um I I
 
05:41:04.468 --> 05:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
still support it because I I think she's
 
05:41:07.030 --> 05:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
not going to change the basic intent
 
05:41:10.110 --> 05:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
which is our schools are increasingly
 
05:41:13.350 --> 05:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
becoming like hospitals and that that is
 
05:41:15.708 --> 05:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
a problem there's supposed to be schools
 
05:41:18.390 --> 05:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
let's have them be schools again not
 
05:41:20.788 --> 05:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals they've gotten away they're
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
not doing such a great job on the
 
05:41:25.628 --> 05:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
academic so I have more distracting
 
05:41:28.830 --> 05:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
things going on at school and so that's
 
05:41:32.670 --> 05:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
the real problem and it's also that um
 
05:41:35.390 --> 05:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
parents are shirking away from their
 
05:41:37.548 --> 05:41:37.558 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to take care of their
 
05:41:40.708 --> 05:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
kids when uh my son was growing up and I
 
05:41:42.948 --> 05:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
did it as a single parent I always took
 
05:41:45.070 --> 05:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
him to his appointment a parent should
 
05:41:48.670 --> 05:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
be there when your kid is having
 
05:41:51.548 --> 05:41:51.558 align:start position:0%
anything medical done I scheduled
 
05:41:54.270 --> 05:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
appointments late in the afternoon so he
 
05:41:56.628 --> 05:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even be missing school it's not
 
05:41:59.110 --> 05:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh taking away from the day you know the
 
05:42:01.390 --> 05:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
school day and where I'd miss the
 
05:42:05.110 --> 05:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
minimal and you uh you should be there
 
05:42:07.628 --> 05:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
when your kid is having anything medical
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
done that's the problem is that people
 
05:42:13.310 --> 05:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
are just uh uh well the school will take
 
05:42:15.030 --> 05:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
care of all that and I don't need to be
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
there and um you know you do know about
 
05:42:20.350 --> 05:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
like the vaccinations uh that happened
 
05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
by mistake and uh so that's one thing
 
05:42:26.868 --> 05:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
right there and also about the uh the
 
05:42:30.270 --> 05:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
Hippa law a 12-year-old girl could
 
05:42:34.110 --> 05:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
request a birth control uh device put in
 
05:42:35.788 --> 05:42:35.798 align:start position:0%
and if it's going to be at school the
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
parents wouldn't even know and the
 
05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
school because of the Hippa law they
 
05:42:41.948 --> 05:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
don't have to reveal that that actually
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
would well maybe I'm wrong on that okay
 
05:42:46.590 --> 05:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
but that's what I've heard a 12-year-old
 
05:42:49.070 --> 05:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
girl uh and if they do these things at
 
05:42:51.150 --> 05:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
school the parents wouldn't know so I
 
05:42:52.750 --> 05:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
think we need to get back to schools
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
being schools again and not being a
 
05:42:57.548 --> 05:42:57.558 align:start position:0%
hospital or a medical center just
 
05:43:00.390 --> 05:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
distracts from the original
 
05:43:04.590 --> 05:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
Mission that's it thank you very much
 
05:43:06.868 --> 05:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
questions see none do you have a
 
05:43:06.878 --> 05:43:07.948 align:start position:0%
questions see none do you have a
question

05:43:07.948 --> 05:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:43:10.548 --> 05:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank
 
05:43:20.590 --> 05:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:23.948 --> 05:43:23.958 align:start position:0%
scare good afternoon chairman cordella
 
05:43:25.390 --> 05:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
and distinguished members of the
 
05:43:27.990 --> 05:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee Steven scare
 
05:43:31.150 --> 05:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
NASA I support this bill as a necessary
 
05:43:33.708 --> 05:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
step in limiting the school's roles in
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
medically and socially transitioning CH
 
05:43:36.600 --> 05:43:38.030 align:start position:0%
medically and socially transitioning CH
children

05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:43:39.910 --> 05:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
I'm an activist trying to prevent
 
05:43:42.030 --> 05:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
children from being exploited through
 
05:43:42.040 --> 05:43:43.350 align:start position:0%
children from being exploited through
gender

05:43:43.350 --> 05:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
gender
 
05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
ideology um my concern is that these
 
05:43:47.788 --> 05:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
clinics have a role in that while I was
 
05:43:50.830 --> 05:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
sitting here I sent a message to my
 
05:43:53.430 --> 05:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
friend Jaimie Reid who worked at a
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
gender clinic in St Louis and she's in
 
05:43:58.830 --> 05:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
the opposite um political spectrum and
 
05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
the political spectrum that I am and I
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
asked her her opinion that she she ended
 
05:44:05.670 --> 05:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
up being a whistleblower in that clinic
 
05:44:07.670 --> 05:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
and she responded to me she with schools
 
05:44:09.310 --> 05:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
by the way as part of this job in
 
05:44:11.150 --> 05:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
Missouri we had a number of school-based
 
05:44:12.708 --> 05:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
Health Centers and yes they are part of
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
the erosion of parental rights and
 
05:44:17.430 --> 05:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
oversight to Medical Care access by
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
teens primarily they are set up to
 
05:44:21.708 --> 05:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
provide birth control mental health
 
05:44:23.948 --> 05:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
medications and some routine Medical
 
05:44:26.230 --> 05:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
Care to kids directly in schools where
 
05:44:27.948 --> 05:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
they go arai is they set up a
 
05:44:30.030 --> 05:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
relationship with the teens outside of
 
05:44:32.628 --> 05:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
the parental oversite in many states
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
teens can consent for birth control
 
05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
without parents consent and needed and
 
05:44:39.430 --> 05:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
they also been extending gender
 
05:44:41.948 --> 05:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
affirming care into the same realm that
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
they placed B birth control and in
 
05:44:46.230 --> 05:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
Oregon I saw they're already doing that
 
05:44:48.270 --> 05:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're writing referrals for
 
05:44:50.708 --> 05:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
surgeries and um prescriptions for
 
05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
cross- sex hormones I'm also a little
 
05:44:54.830 --> 05:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
concerned because we already know our
 
05:44:57.708 --> 05:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
public schools are secretly affirming
 
05:44:59.590 --> 05:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
children's gender identity which are
 
05:45:02.270 --> 05:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
entirely imaginary constructs no one can
 
05:45:04.270 --> 05:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
disprove them or affirm them they're
 
05:45:07.110 --> 05:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
based on stereotypes and circular reason
 
05:45:09.868 --> 05:45:09.878 align:start position:0%
in and two years ago Dr Simon ball of
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health talked about testifying
 
05:45:14.190 --> 05:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
to the Health and Human Services
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee If the parents aren't
 
05:45:18.468 --> 05:45:18.478 align:start position:0%
affirming the children then parents
 
05:45:20.670 --> 05:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
should the children should be um turning
 
05:45:23.150 --> 05:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
to other trusted adults until schools
 
05:45:26.150 --> 05:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
including schools so I'm I'm strongly
 
05:45:28.628 --> 05:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
against making schools part of what I
 
05:45:30.990 --> 05:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
see as a very very destructive and
 
05:45:35.190 --> 05:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
harmful pattern of exploitations of
 
05:45:38.510 --> 05:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
children thank you very much
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
represent moris uh thank you Mr thank
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question did I hear
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
you right when it sounded like you said
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
that uh some of these clinics were
 
05:45:49.948 --> 05:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
providing puberty blockers to students
 
05:45:52.708 --> 05:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
without parental consent if I said
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and I misspoke it is in
 
05:46:01.070 --> 05:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
Portland Oregon cross sex hormones and
 
05:46:04.590 --> 05:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
um letters of referral for momies and
 
05:46:06.910 --> 05:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
their laws are such that if a
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
16-year-old girls decides I want to get
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
a myectomy because I have a male gender
 
05:46:13.948 --> 05:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
identity she can go ahead and get that
 
05:46:16.390 --> 05:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
and then her parents will get the bill
 
05:46:18.670 --> 05:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:46:20.750 --> 05:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
surgery be clear you're talking about
 
05:46:22.948 --> 05:46:22.958 align:start position:0%

19 um I strongly support this bill um I
 
05:48:27.430 --> 05:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
can't even imagine those things
 
05:48:30.190 --> 05:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
happening I have two teenage daughters
 
05:48:32.670 --> 05:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
um any of those things happening without
 
05:48:37.110 --> 05:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
my knowledge um or care being involved
 
05:48:38.788 --> 05:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
one of the main reasons why I support
 
05:48:41.670 --> 05:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
this bill has a lot to do with um during
 
05:48:44.948 --> 05:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and I will uh provide this
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
information to the committee this bill
 
05:48:48.590 --> 05:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't come forward in the sense that
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
I've ever testified on something similar
 
05:48:53.548 --> 05:48:53.558 align:start position:0%
so actually it's another representative
 
05:48:55.868 --> 05:48:55.878 align:start position:0%
now we both ran together and she's in
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
Milton and we went she asked me to come
 
05:49:01.190 --> 05:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
testify at a school board meeting about
 
05:49:03.948 --> 05:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
just some spe uh specific like Esser
 
05:49:06.270 --> 05:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
grants and certain things like that just
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
to give them
 
05:49:11.670 --> 05:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
um the school board some information and
 
05:49:14.670 --> 05:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
we walked in we we were in the
 
05:49:16.510 --> 05:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meeting and then there was a
 
05:49:19.350 --> 05:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
there was like a break we came out in
 
05:49:23.310 --> 05:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
the hallway and on a table they were
 
05:49:25.628 --> 05:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
doing um
 
05:49:28.468 --> 05:49:28.478 align:start position:0%
vaccinations there was no one there and
 
05:49:31.628 --> 05:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
there were vials and needles just out
 
05:49:35.070 --> 05:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
there and a whole group of students
 
05:49:38.670 --> 05:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
playing basketball in the gym I thought
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
I was like in an an opposite world and
 
05:49:44.910 --> 05:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
this is where we really the another
 
05:49:47.150 --> 05:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
testimony said schools need to be
 
05:49:49.270 --> 05:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
schools why can't we go back to that I
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to you know age myself here
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
but you know I graduated high school in
 
05:49:53.040 --> 05:49:53.868 align:start position:0%
but you know I graduated high school in
in

05:49:53.868 --> 05:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:49:59.310 --> 05:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
1991 um and I I can't imagine any of
 
05:50:01.030 --> 05:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
this like why aren't we getting back to
 
05:50:03.150 --> 05:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
the basics why aren't we supporting good
 
05:50:05.070 --> 05:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
teachers why aren't we teaching you know
 
05:50:07.350 --> 05:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
Reading Writing math arithm what are we
 
05:50:09.948 --> 05:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
doing like we're going down such a such
 
05:50:12.270 --> 05:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
a wrong path let parents do what they
 
05:50:14.868 --> 05:50:14.878 align:start position:0%
need to do in their own and if there is
 
05:50:17.548 --> 05:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
a need for community health clinics
 
05:50:18.948 --> 05:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
those are all happening right now you
 
05:50:20.670 --> 05:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
can get everything that you want by
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
walking into a a CVS or a Walgreens and
 
05:50:25.788 --> 05:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
all of that there's so much that's
 
05:50:29.110 --> 05:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
available that I never had available um
 
05:50:31.788 --> 05:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
when I was young as well so I just
 
05:50:34.270 --> 05:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
really hope that um the committee looks
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
at these things and I will send uh those
 
05:50:38.788 --> 05:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
pictures and that story I think it got
 
05:50:40.990 --> 05:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
published in a couple different articles
 
05:50:43.190 --> 05:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
we were we were it was representative
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
Burnham and I and we were quite
 
05:50:47.230 --> 05:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
horrified we literally could have
 
05:50:50.270 --> 05:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
grabbed that it was the vials everything
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
it was um we just we need to have
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
medical professionals be doing what
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're be what they should be doing in
 
05:51:01.310 --> 05:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
their places and then we need Educators
 
05:51:02.990 --> 05:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
fantastic Educators doing what they
 
05:51:05.150 --> 05:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
should be doing in their places and
 
05:51:07.948 --> 05:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
let's keep that separate thank you thank
 
05:51:11.190 --> 05:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
you uh any questions for the
 
05:51:13.830 --> 05:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative see none thank
 
05:51:24.150 --> 05:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:26.430 --> 05:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
BL thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:51:28.110 --> 05:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Melissa blasik I'm here
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
representing rebuild NH I just want to
 
05:51:33.868 --> 05:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
kind of Rapid Fire answer some questions
 
05:51:36.628 --> 05:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
um that didn't get answered before so I
 
05:51:38.948 --> 05:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
would recommend amending this bill to
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
say specifically medical diagnosis that
 
05:51:44.750 --> 05:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
is legally different than nursing
 
05:51:47.310 --> 05:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um what nurses do in school
 
05:51:50.350 --> 05:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
currently is is it in the scope of
 
05:51:52.590 --> 05:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
nursing diagnosis as opposed to medical
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um the clinics in New
 
05:51:56.910 --> 05:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are very new we're talking
 
05:51:59.070 --> 05:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
matter of months old so there's not a
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
lot of information about them yet we
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
really have a unique opportunity we we
 
05:52:05.070 --> 05:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
are the last state in the country to get
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
school-based health clinics and we have
 
05:52:10.270 --> 05:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
a um a real opportunity to kind of look
 
05:52:12.030 --> 05:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
around and see what's happening in other
 
05:52:14.110 --> 05:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
states and put some roadblocks and
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
barriers up here before it really takes
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
hold because right now we have four
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
clinics it's not a lot right um yes the
 
05:52:23.190 --> 05:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester School the new one is a
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
school-based health clinic school
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
because it's replacing an existing one
 
05:52:28.868 --> 05:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
and dental screenings and cleanings
 
05:52:31.708 --> 05:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
would be fine under this law um you
 
05:52:33.190 --> 05:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do further dental
 
05:52:34.910 --> 05:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
work but you could do a screening and
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
and uh refer out for you know more work
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh you could do cleanings um okay
 
05:52:44.468 --> 05:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
so I didn't know anything about
 
05:52:46.350 --> 05:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
school-based health clinics until last
 
05:52:49.310 --> 05:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
year there was a bill in the Senate and
 
05:52:51.230 --> 05:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
it was to create an entire legal
 
05:52:52.990 --> 05:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
framework for school based health
 
05:52:53.000 --> 05:52:54.150 align:start position:0%
framework for school based health
clinics

05:52:54.150 --> 05:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
clinics
 
05:52:57.468 --> 05:52:57.478 align:start position:0%
now currently they are neither legal nor
 
05:53:00.110 --> 05:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
illegal if that makes sense there's
 
05:53:02.590 --> 05:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
nothing there's no statute that sort of
 
05:53:05.390 --> 05:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
creates a legal framework for them so
 
05:53:08.230 --> 05:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
they sort of just op operate a little
 
05:53:11.150 --> 05:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly if I'm being honest um that
 
05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
build did die and I started doing a lot
 
05:53:17.468 --> 05:53:17.478 align:start position:0%
more research on them this is not like
 
05:53:20.548 --> 05:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
your vaccine Clinics of old okay it is
 
05:53:22.390 --> 05:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
not where the school nurse just rolls in
 
05:53:23.990 --> 05:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
and does a treatment that's a treatment
 
05:53:25.590 --> 05:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
by the way so that's still allowed under
 
05:53:28.788 --> 05:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
the spill um these are fullscale
 
05:53:32.190 --> 05:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
diagnostic clinics um and a they are all
 
05:53:33.868 --> 05:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
slightly different it depends on what
 
05:53:36.670 --> 05:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
they've chosen to do but they have the
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
ability to be fullscale diagnostic um
 
05:53:42.910 --> 05:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
and surgical units if they want to be um
 
05:53:44.510 --> 05:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
and that does happen in different parts
 
05:53:46.270 --> 05:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the country they do minor surgeries
 
05:53:50.230 --> 05:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
um so these are third-party clinics we
 
05:53:51.868 --> 05:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
are opening up public schools and
 
05:53:54.390 --> 05:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
offering private corporations unlimited
 
05:53:56.670 --> 05:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
access to an incredibly vulnerable
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
population children who are there
 
05:54:00.628 --> 05:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
without their parents the state and
 
05:54:02.430 --> 05:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
locality should not be in the business
 
05:54:05.030 --> 05:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
of lining pockets of Corporations at the
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
expense of children
 
05:54:08.990 --> 05:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
parental consent yes parental consent
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
would be required but there is no
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
standardization of how that consent is
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
given so to answer representative
 
05:54:20.110 --> 05:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
Freeman's question before some of them
 
05:54:22.070 --> 05:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
do operate where the parent just signs a
 
05:54:23.590 --> 05:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
blanket form at the beginning of the
 
05:54:24.830 --> 05:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
year A lot of times they don't even know
 
05:54:26.830 --> 05:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
that that's what they're signing off
 
05:54:31.590 --> 05:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
for um so that is accept for a few
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
things um title 10 requires so this is
 
05:54:36.990 --> 05:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
standard across the entire country it
 
05:54:39.868 --> 05:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
says that every child over the age of 12
 
05:54:41.708 --> 05:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
has to be allowed access to birth
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
control and uh Addiction Services
 
05:54:47.310 --> 05:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
without parental consent so if you have
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
a school-based health clinic your child
 
05:54:50.830 --> 05:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
can go and get those things over the age
 
05:54:53.670 --> 05:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
of 12 without parental consent and then
 
05:54:55.270 --> 05:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire laot in addition to
 
05:54:56.948 --> 05:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
that requires that they have access to
 
05:54:59.868 --> 05:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
SCD uh testing and treatment without
 
05:55:01.788 --> 05:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
parental consent so those are the things
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire a child could go
 
05:55:06.548 --> 05:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
to a school-based health clinic and get
 
05:55:08.788 --> 05:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
done without their parental consent now
 
05:55:12.310 --> 05:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
if you could wrap up okay um so last
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
year mistakes do happen last year there
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
were two children who got vaccinated
 
05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
against their parents will right those
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
were mistakes because in you know
 
05:55:22.788 --> 05:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
parental consent is
 
05:55:25.628 --> 05:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
required but I know parents who will not
 
05:55:27.468 --> 05:55:27.478 align:start position:0%
send their children to school on vaccine
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
clinic days because they're afraid of
 
05:55:31.270 --> 05:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
mistakes if we allow school-based health
 
05:55:33.310 --> 05:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
clinics to take hold every day is is
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinic day where there is a risk
 
05:55:39.628 --> 05:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
for uh mistakes so um yes I will take
 
05:55:42.548 --> 05:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
any questions but please support um HB
 
05:55:45.868 --> 05:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
361 any questions represent McDonald
 
05:55:49.070 --> 05:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you um you
 
05:55:52.270 --> 05:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that under New Hampshire law I
 
05:55:54.230 --> 05:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
believe you said age 12 felt parental
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
consent for both birth control and a
 
05:55:57.548 --> 05:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
number of other things and previous
 
05:55:59.788 --> 05:55:59.798 align:start position:0%
speakers mentioned the birth control
 
05:56:02.070 --> 05:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
implant you mentioned minor surgeries
 
05:56:04.030 --> 05:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
would be allowed so under current New
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Law Without this bill would
 
05:56:07.868 --> 05:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
say a young girl be able to go into one
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
of these clinics and get a birth control
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
implant without parental consent as
 
05:56:14.468 --> 05:56:14.478 align:start position:0%
young as age 12 yes and and an IUD um
 
05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that is already the case they could
 
05:56:18.070 --> 05:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
go off to another doctor and get that
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
done without parental consent but there
 
05:56:22.510 --> 05:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
is a certain limiting factor of
 
05:56:25.030 --> 05:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
typically a child the age of 12 probably
 
05:56:26.468 --> 05:56:26.478 align:start position:0%
needs somebody to drive them right so
 
05:56:28.230 --> 05:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of Parental
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
involvement this is unfettered access
 
05:56:32.110 --> 05:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
because it's in the room next to their
 
05:56:35.190 --> 05:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
classroom wow thank you further
 
05:56:35.200 --> 05:56:36.990 align:start position:0%
classroom wow thank you further
questions

05:56:36.990 --> 05:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:56:39.468 --> 05:56:39.478 align:start position:0%
seen none thank you very much thank
 
05:56:50.590 --> 05:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
Banfield okay
 
05:56:55.868 --> 05:56:55.878 align:start position:0%
so Melissa pretty much covered a lot of
 
05:56:57.830 --> 05:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
what I was going to do um what I was
 
05:56:59.510 --> 05:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to say so good I don't have to
 
05:57:01.750 --> 05:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
repeat it this is kind of like your
 
05:57:03.670 --> 05:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
child walk oh sorry Amry Banfield for
 
05:57:05.750 --> 05:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
the record it's like your child going
 
05:57:08.468 --> 05:57:08.478 align:start position:0%
out the Urgent Care and getting medical
 
05:57:12.270 --> 05:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
services and you're not with them most
 
05:57:13.910 --> 05:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
parents would never do something like
 
05:57:16.030 --> 05:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
that but I think when you when you make
 
05:57:17.750 --> 05:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
it the norm ins side of school we're
 
05:57:21.628 --> 05:57:21.638 align:start position:0%
going to start seeing that that happen
 
05:57:24.430 --> 05:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
um I went through the memorandum of
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
understanding with Manchester and amamos
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
and I found numerous problems with it as
 
05:57:31.830 --> 05:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
as just
 
05:57:34.230 --> 05:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
anybody looking for problems would have
 
05:57:37.110 --> 05:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
probably found them um
 
05:57:39.830 --> 05:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
for instance uh and I I will give you
 
05:57:41.548 --> 05:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
all this and then I can also send you
 
05:57:43.070 --> 05:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
the memorandum of understanding so you
 
05:57:45.868 --> 05:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
can connect it so AMS geg is responsible
 
05:57:48.270 --> 05:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
for the confidenti confidentiality and
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
security of all student data and must
 
05:57:52.628 --> 05:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
notify MSD immediately upon any breach
 
05:57:55.150 --> 05:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
of security there's no provision for
 
05:57:55.160 --> 05:57:57.430 align:start position:0%
of security there's no provision for
telling

05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
telling
 
05:57:59.830 --> 05:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
parents once again parents are the last
 
05:58:03.150 --> 05:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
to find out um and maybe they will tell
 
05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
parents but it's not in the memorandum
 
05:58:07.670 --> 05:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
of understanding
 
05:58:10.270 --> 05:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a reference to the multi-tier
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
system of support for Behavior we
 
05:58:14.070 --> 05:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
already know that third parties will not
 
05:58:15.708 --> 05:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
give me information on what they're
 
05:58:19.270 --> 05:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
doing um and in basic information on if
 
05:58:20.670 --> 05:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
they're even billing Medicaid or
 
05:58:22.990 --> 05:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
insurance I can't get that from some of
 
05:58:24.670 --> 05:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
the uh some of the requests that I've
 
05:58:28.628 --> 05:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
made to third party um
 
05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
organizations and they a lot of times
 
05:58:32.708 --> 05:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
when Federal money is funding this you
 
05:58:34.430 --> 05:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
have to report back to the Fed so there
 
05:58:36.110 --> 05:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
has to be reports that go back to the
 
05:58:37.390 --> 05:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
federal government there a lot of this
 
05:58:38.548 --> 05:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
money is coming from the federal
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
government so they're going to have to
 
05:58:42.788 --> 05:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
come up with reports to report back as
 
05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
we know that has been done with um Keen
 
05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
state with mtssb and Keen state was uh
 
05:58:53.070 --> 05:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry there were people pressuring
 
05:58:55.150 --> 05:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
the school counselors to give personal
 
05:58:57.628 --> 05:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
mental health information on student to
 
05:59:01.070 --> 05:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
Keen state to develop their report that
 
05:59:02.910 --> 05:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
information was given to me by a school
 
05:59:05.110 --> 05:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
counselor I believe to the chairman and
 
05:59:07.270 --> 05:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
I believe to the Comm
 
05:59:10.270 --> 05:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
commer amamos Health may have access to
 
05:59:12.350 --> 05:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
protected student information due to its
 
05:59:14.708 --> 05:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
legitimate educational interest they
 
05:59:16.590 --> 05:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
cannot perform their services without
 
05:59:19.190 --> 05:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
access to the student data there is the
 
05:59:23.190 --> 05:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
fle loophole so once again their citing
 
05:59:26.468 --> 05:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
this information is protected but if you
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
understand the student Protection Law
 
05:59:32.070 --> 05:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions so now somebody
 
05:59:34.708 --> 05:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
from the outside can access this
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
information people people that nurse
 
05:59:39.590 --> 05:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
practitioners doctors whoever helping
 
05:59:42.708 --> 05:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
these children this now is information
 
05:59:44.230 --> 05:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know if you're taking your do your
 
05:59:47.230 --> 05:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
child to a doctor you know that all that
 
05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
information is staying there for
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
depending on what they have to to reveal
 
05:59:54.110 --> 05:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
to your insurance this is another
 
05:59:57.868 --> 05:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
medical facility so there so there are
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
ways that information can be shared
 
06:00:01.948 --> 06:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
without parental consent if you could
 
06:00:03.910 --> 06:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
wrap up Miss oh boy I've got a whole lot
 
06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
to go over but you know what why don't I
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
just send this to you um let see if I
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
can if there's everything oh yeah so you
 
06:00:14.510 --> 06:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
know I do find an I mean my daughter's a
 
06:00:17.310 --> 06:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner so her reaction to
 
06:00:18.990 --> 06:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
this was quite shocking because she's
 
06:00:20.990 --> 06:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
worked in Pediatrics before so she's
 
06:00:22.708 --> 06:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
worked with the actual doctors of
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
children that have come into the
 
06:00:25.708 --> 06:00:25.718 align:start position:0%
hospital and that
 
06:00:28.628 --> 06:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
communication issue is what she thought
 
06:00:29.788 --> 06:00:29.798 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a problem they're
 
06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to see somebody completely
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
separate from their doctor without their
 
06:00:36.750 --> 06:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
parent there how are they getting all of
 
06:00:39.150 --> 06:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
the background medical information on
 
06:00:43.468 --> 06:00:43.478 align:start position:0%
that child to service that child maybe
 
06:00:45.548 --> 06:00:45.558 align:start position:0%
give them um medication something like
 
06:00:46.990 --> 06:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
that if they're coming in with di if
 
06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
they're diabetic they're coming in with
 
06:00:51.230 --> 06:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
any kind of medical issues that the
 
06:00:54.590 --> 06:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
child may not share you know kids don't
 
06:00:57.270 --> 06:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily say oh by the way I have
 
06:01:00.270 --> 06:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
this genetic flaw in my family thank you
 
06:01:02.590 --> 06:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
very much okay I'll I'll email it to you
 
06:01:05.628 --> 06:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions see none thank
 
06:01:05.638 --> 06:01:06.548 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions see none thank
you

06:01:06.548 --> 06:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:01:24.628 --> 06:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:27.510 --> 06:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
York Gary York from hopkington New
 
06:01:30.548 --> 06:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh chairman and members of the
 
06:01:34.350 --> 06:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
committee uh I must admit a fair amount
 
06:01:37.788 --> 06:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
of ignorance about this whole concept of
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
medical clinics in a school system it it
 
06:01:43.628 --> 06:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
seems outrageous uh at the
 
06:01:47.670 --> 06:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
outset um I I imagine that we would be
 
06:01:50.190 --> 06:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
looking at maybe Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
06:01:54.468 --> 06:01:54.478 align:start position:0%
Clinic Hopkinson high school or or or
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital uh satellite Clinic
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
some such thing I'm not really sure
 
06:02:05.510 --> 06:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
um I consider myself a strong proponent
 
06:02:08.270 --> 06:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
of medical freedoms including but not
 
06:02:11.390 --> 06:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
limited to Reproductive Rights job
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
mandates masking Medical Aid and dying
 
06:02:18.190 --> 06:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
Etc uh I think that is something that
 
06:02:20.110 --> 06:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens should be
 
06:02:22.990 --> 06:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
entitled to however having said that I
 
06:02:25.910 --> 06:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
am not in favor of such medical freedoms
 
06:02:30.110 --> 06:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
for students minors less than 18 years
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
old uh to me this is
 
06:02:37.310 --> 06:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
just another attempt from evil sources
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
to rest control from parents regarding
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
health care decisions for their
 
06:02:47.350 --> 06:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
children another concern I have is
 
06:02:50.708 --> 06:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
that should there be such a
 
06:02:54.510 --> 06:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
medical uh complex or Annex within a
 
06:02:59.310 --> 06:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
school system the very proximity to this
 
06:03:02.230 --> 06:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh to students is scary because as you
 
06:03:04.310 --> 06:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
all know having been there in high
 
06:03:07.390 --> 06:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
school the amount of PE pressure that
 
06:03:10.230 --> 06:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
exists in school today uh you might have
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
a situation where uh because this is in
 
06:03:17.430 --> 06:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
the school uh maybe the the high school
 
06:03:20.788 --> 06:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
basketball team or the middle school
 
06:03:22.948 --> 06:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
cheerleaders are pressuring each other
 
06:03:25.670 --> 06:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
to get a a a new jab or something like
 
06:03:28.830 --> 06:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
that so the very fact that it's a
 
06:03:32.468 --> 06:03:32.478 align:start position:0%
concept that would be proximal to so
 
06:03:32.478 --> 06:03:33.310 align:start position:0%
concept that would be proximal to so
many

06:03:33.310 --> 06:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
many
 
06:03:36.270 --> 06:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
students uh whether it be Community
 
06:03:38.190 --> 06:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
Health Clinic for the whole
 
06:03:41.030 --> 06:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
Community um nonetheless that it's so
 
06:03:44.310 --> 06:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
close is scary as a physician I worry
 
06:03:46.708 --> 06:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
about the oversight for something like
 
06:03:50.628 --> 06:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
that uh so yes it is a proactive uh bill
 
06:03:53.110 --> 06:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
for sure and I don't
 
06:03:56.150 --> 06:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
know what these things look like but I
 
06:03:59.430 --> 06:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
think we need such a a bill in place to
 
06:04:02.990 --> 06:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
sort of avoid any attempts to have these
 
06:04:05.070 --> 06:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
health clinics infiltrate our school
 
06:04:05.080 --> 06:04:06.510 align:start position:0%
health clinics infiltrate our school
systems

06:04:06.510 --> 06:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
systems

Chester I'm from Bedford New Hampshire
 
06:04:27.708 --> 06:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
um as I had said previously I have a
 
06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
long history of abuse and neglect
 
06:04:31.548 --> 06:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
working with children uh but I'm going
 
06:04:33.708 --> 06:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
to tell you a personal story more than
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
10 years ago my
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
stepdaughter was provided with a pelvic
 
06:04:47.190 --> 06:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
exam and provided with birth control in
 
06:04:50.670 --> 06:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
Middle School it was because my child
 
06:04:53.670 --> 06:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
has a history my my stepchild had a
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
history of abuse and neglect significant
 
06:04:58.750 --> 06:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect from when she was a
 
06:04:58.760 --> 06:05:00.270 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect from when she was a
small

06:05:00.270 --> 06:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
small
 
06:05:03.030 --> 06:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
child we chose to move to the school
 
06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
district we did because she wanted a
 
06:05:08.230 --> 06:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
fresh start she didn't want everyone
 
06:05:11.230 --> 06:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
knowing her history so when we moved to
 
06:05:14.070 --> 06:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
that new school district we didn't tell
 
06:05:17.350 --> 06:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
everybody what we as parents were doing
 
06:05:20.150 --> 06:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
she was going to counseling three days a
 
06:05:23.708 --> 06:05:23.718 align:start position:0%
week and when it came time for sex
 
06:05:26.948 --> 06:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
education in the classroom the note came
 
06:05:30.350 --> 06:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
home and I encouraged her not to do the
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
classes because I was worried about her
 
06:05:36.150 --> 06:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
trauma history she wanted to be be a
 
06:05:39.190 --> 06:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
normal kid and she asked to go through
 
06:05:39.200 --> 06:05:40.070 align:start position:0%
normal kid and she asked to go through
those

06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:05:44.788 --> 06:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
classes I agreed under the under the
 
06:05:46.830 --> 06:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
agreement that she would come home every
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
day and talk to me about those classes
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
about 2 weeks into the classes she shut
 
06:05:54.868 --> 06:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
down on me I went to the school
 
06:05:57.548 --> 06:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
counselor and I said what's going on I
 
06:06:00.468 --> 06:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
don't understand she has completely
 
06:06:02.350 --> 06:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
she's like a different child she's
 
06:06:05.590 --> 06:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
depressed she's anxious she's she's say
 
06:06:07.230 --> 06:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
saying that everything's going fine but
 
06:06:10.350 --> 06:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
clearly it's not going
 
06:06:14.310 --> 06:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
fine staff at the school
 
06:06:17.190 --> 06:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
assumed that my daughter was being
 
06:06:22.110 --> 06:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
abused by her father and myself not that
 
06:06:24.430 --> 06:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
this was what they call
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
transference now this was a school
 
06:06:29.670 --> 06:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
counselor school counselors are not
 
06:06:33.270 --> 06:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately prepared to understand the
 
06:06:37.190 --> 06:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
significance between the find the whole
 
06:06:40.670 --> 06:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
child and although this is medical it is
 
06:06:43.708 --> 06:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
also they put my child on birth control
 
06:06:45.948 --> 06:06:45.958 align:start position:0%
without parental knowledge or consent
 
06:06:48.788 --> 06:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
and they did that because it it was a
 
06:06:51.708 --> 06:06:51.718 align:start position:0%
risk to the child if if because the
 
06:06:54.788 --> 06:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
parents might be causing this abuse and
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
neglect so and in the state of New
 
06:06:59.990 --> 06:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the way it works if you
 
06:07:02.670 --> 06:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
if the teacher says teacher School staff
 
06:07:05.948 --> 06:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
says I the child is reporting that she
 
06:07:09.628 --> 06:07:09.638 align:start position:0%
is afraid to tell the truth to the
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
parents that is the ability for the
 
06:07:15.350 --> 06:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
school to say well we didn't have to
 
06:07:18.110 --> 06:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
tell you because we were afraid of the
 
06:07:20.430 --> 06:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
consequences these child health clinics
 
06:07:23.190 --> 06:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
are dangerous I worked in a child health
 
06:07:26.190 --> 06:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
clinic and I can honestly say it is not
 
06:07:27.948 --> 06:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate for it to be taking place in
 
06:07:31.548 --> 06:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
the school without parental rights in
 
06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
place thank you any
 
06:07:36.468 --> 06:07:36.478 align:start position:0%

going to open the hearing on host Bill
 
06:16:54.390 --> 06:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
50 relative to teaching discrimination
 
06:16:56.750 --> 06:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
in public schools and discrimination in
 
06:16:59.150 --> 06:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
public workplaces and I welcome the
 
06:17:06.788 --> 06:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:09.548 --> 06:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair and
 
06:17:12.110 --> 06:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the Recon
 
06:17:14.110 --> 06:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
representative Peter patrino from the
 
06:17:16.868 --> 06:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
town of Milford and I'm here in yet
 
06:17:19.990 --> 06:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
another attempt at repealing the law
 
06:17:21.468 --> 06:17:21.478 align:start position:0%
titled the right to freedom from
 
06:17:23.310 --> 06:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the workplace and
 
06:17:25.830 --> 06:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
education mindful that I have been
 
06:17:28.390 --> 06:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful in the past but as a matter
 
06:17:31.310 --> 06:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
of principle I decided to file it once
 
06:17:33.750 --> 06:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
again as a former social studies teacher
 
06:17:35.910 --> 06:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
and department head I dedicated my
 
06:17:38.430 --> 06:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
entire adult life to education and
 
06:17:40.430 --> 06:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
attempted to create classroom lessons
 
06:17:42.750 --> 06:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
which were relevant Dynamic and
 
06:17:45.110 --> 06:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
inspiring that hopefully encouraged my
 
06:17:47.030 --> 06:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
students to become lifelong Learners and
 
06:17:49.948 --> 06:17:49.958 align:start position:0%
independent thinkers and I truly see
 
06:17:53.070 --> 06:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
this law as an obstacle to that that it
 
06:17:55.510 --> 06:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
stifles meaningful education and I also
 
06:17:56.708 --> 06:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
believe that I speak for the vast
 
06:17:58.750 --> 06:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
majority of teachers in this
 
06:18:02.070 --> 06:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
regard social studies is not about
 
06:18:04.868 --> 06:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
simply memorizing facts in civics
 
06:18:07.230 --> 06:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
economics geography and history it's
 
06:18:09.670 --> 06:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
about guiding students and utilizing
 
06:18:11.430 --> 06:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
their knowledge to develop critical
 
06:18:13.868 --> 06:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
thinking skills leading them to form
 
06:18:16.590 --> 06:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
well-reasoned objective opinions about
 
06:18:18.510 --> 06:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
the world they live in so they can
 
06:18:21.830 --> 06:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
become thoughtful and engaging citizens
 
06:18:24.270 --> 06:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
now at meramac high school we attempted
 
06:18:26.510 --> 06:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
to meet these objectives by developing
 
06:18:29.468 --> 06:18:29.478 align:start position:0%
competencies around research skills
 
06:18:32.030 --> 06:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
content knowledge critical analysis and
 
06:18:32.040 --> 06:18:33.150 align:start position:0%
content knowledge critical analysis and
objective

06:18:33.150 --> 06:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
objective
 
06:18:36.110 --> 06:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
evaluations one engage in activity was
 
06:18:37.830 --> 06:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
for the students to make their own
 
06:18:40.270 --> 06:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
personal predictions about America's
 
06:18:43.270 --> 06:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
future utilizing comparisons in
 
06:18:46.670 --> 06:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
contrasts to that of the Roman Empire
 
06:18:48.830 --> 06:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
now aside from any factual errors there
 
06:18:51.708 --> 06:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
were no right or wrong answers to their
 
06:18:54.190 --> 06:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
conclusions however it was a
 
06:18:56.190 --> 06:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
demonstration of the students critical
 
06:18:59.430 --> 06:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
analysis and well reasoned opinions
 
06:19:02.030 --> 06:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
using their knowledge of both current
 
06:19:05.910 --> 06:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
events and historical facts so it's true
 
06:19:07.230 --> 06:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
that the current law allows for the
 
06:19:09.670 --> 06:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
teaching of history but it makes it
 
06:19:11.350 --> 06:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult when trying to
 
06:19:13.390 --> 06:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
examine the past and the context of some
 
06:19:17.150 --> 06:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
of today's issues as I just described so
 
06:19:19.788 --> 06:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
for example for many years the Roman
 
06:19:22.030 --> 06:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
Empire struggled with massive migrations
 
06:19:24.390 --> 06:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
from Germanic tribes along their
 
06:19:26.590 --> 06:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
Northern borders they built walls they
 
06:19:29.948 --> 06:19:29.958 align:start position:0%
deployed border patrols they engaged in
 
06:19:32.750 --> 06:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
military clashes so can a classroom
 
06:19:34.868 --> 06:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
discussion ensue that makes parallels to
 
06:19:36.590 --> 06:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
today's migration crossings from the
 
06:19:39.310 --> 06:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
Mexican border especially as some frame
 
06:19:42.070 --> 06:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
the issue within a racial context now
 
06:19:44.150 --> 06:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
that would be a thoughtful and engaging
 
06:19:46.510 --> 06:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
classroom discussion but teachers worry
 
06:19:50.230 --> 06:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
can they even go there so finally in
 
06:19:52.310 --> 06:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
every Walk of Life you're going to find
 
06:19:54.468 --> 06:19:54.478 align:start position:0%
examples of those who conduct themselves
 
06:19:54.478 --> 06:19:55.990 align:start position:0%
examples of those who conduct themselves
inappropriately

06:19:55.990 --> 06:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriately
 
06:19:58.310 --> 06:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
unprofessionally but you do not address
 
06:20:01.868 --> 06:20:01.878 align:start position:0%
the improper behaviors of some by making
 
06:20:03.868 --> 06:20:03.878 align:start position:0%
it difficult for everyone to do their
 
06:20:03.878 --> 06:20:05.548 align:start position:0%
it difficult for everyone to do their
jobs

06:20:05.548 --> 06:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
06:20:07.948 --> 06:20:07.958 align:start position:0%
education is about
 
06:20:11.468 --> 06:20:11.478 align:start position:0%
teaching opening Minds
 
06:20:14.590 --> 06:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
indoctrination is about preaching and
 
06:20:17.468 --> 06:20:17.478 align:start position:0%
controlling Minds those in the classroom
 
06:20:19.868 --> 06:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
who do not know the difference need to
 
06:20:23.190 --> 06:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
be set straight but this law is not the
 
06:20:25.270 --> 06:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
answer thank you very much for listening
 
06:20:27.150 --> 06:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
to my testimony I'll be happy to take
 
06:20:32.070 --> 06:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:36.070 --> 06:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions representa cel thank you um
 
06:20:38.030 --> 06:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
can you would you be willing to share
 
06:20:39.628 --> 06:20:39.638 align:start position:0%
some examples of ways in which some
 
06:20:40.990 --> 06:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
teachers may have expressed their
 
06:20:44.070 --> 06:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
feelings of being by by the current law
 
06:20:45.708 --> 06:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
being incapable of teaching some of
 
06:20:46.948 --> 06:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
these things could you elaborate on that
 
06:20:49.030 --> 06:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit certainly uh there have
 
06:20:51.190 --> 06:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
been a number of instances you take a
 
06:20:53.750 --> 06:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
look at some of the uh current events uh
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
that we're uh engaging uh with you just
 
06:20:58.990 --> 06:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
go online and you see words like uh
 
06:21:02.910 --> 06:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
Nazis and fascism uh socialism uh just
 
06:21:04.670 --> 06:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
thrown about willy-nilly
 
06:21:07.070 --> 06:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
young people are on social media are
 
06:21:08.548 --> 06:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
reading all of this and they have
 
06:21:10.788 --> 06:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
questions so in the classroom you know
 
06:21:14.110 --> 06:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
you study the past why just for Trivial
 
06:21:18.350 --> 06:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
Pursuit no you study the past so you can
 
06:21:20.030 --> 06:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on today make
 
06:21:22.430 --> 06:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
those connections and maybe kind of make
 
06:21:24.750 --> 06:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
the world a better place in the future
 
06:21:27.230 --> 06:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
so you examine uh the Civil Rights
 
06:21:30.070 --> 06:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
Movement for example and can you talk
 
06:21:32.628 --> 06:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
about uh today's um uh White
 
06:21:34.788 --> 06:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
supremacists you know or if you talk
 
06:21:36.990 --> 06:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
about the Holocaust do you just leave it
 
06:21:40.430 --> 06:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the past and never ever discuss um
 
06:21:42.868 --> 06:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
today's neo-nazis because as soon as you
 
06:21:44.310 --> 06:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
bring that up a teacher is like oh well
 
06:21:45.868 --> 06:21:45.878 align:start position:0%
we can't go there so what we're going to
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
do is we're just going to talk about the
 
06:21:49.430 --> 06:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
past and we'll just fill you ahe with a
 
06:21:51.910 --> 06:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
lot of facts so you can go on a Jeopardy
 
06:21:54.070 --> 06:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
and and win some big prizes and that's
 
06:21:56.548 --> 06:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
not what education's about there's a
 
06:22:00.468 --> 06:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
reason why we we teach and it's to
 
06:22:02.628 --> 06:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
enable individuals to be thoughtful and
 
06:22:04.548 --> 06:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
engaging individuals so we can have
 
06:22:06.350 --> 06:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
debates and discussions just like we do
 
06:22:08.590 --> 06:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
right here in committee room you know I
 
06:22:10.390 --> 06:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
like to think that all of us come from a
 
06:22:12.708 --> 06:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
place of some knowledge we think about
 
06:22:15.670 --> 06:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
it and then we present our opinions I
 
06:22:17.150 --> 06:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
used to say to my students I would joke
 
06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
at them they'd say well this is how I
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
feel this is what I think and I say you
 
06:22:22.150 --> 06:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
know I I really don't care what you feel
 
06:22:23.510 --> 06:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
and what you think and they look at me
 
06:22:25.788 --> 06:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
well that's that's my opinion like okay
 
06:22:27.910 --> 06:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
wait a second if you can present that
 
06:22:30.430 --> 06:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
argument in a way that has some facts
 
06:22:34.110 --> 06:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
behind it I might be go okay okay but
 
06:22:36.030 --> 06:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
then maybe I'll push back a little bit
 
06:22:37.548 --> 06:22:37.558 align:start position:0%
and give you some other things to think
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
about you see it's about putting
 
06:22:41.190 --> 06:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts in your head and thinking and
 
06:22:43.868 --> 06:22:43.878 align:start position:0%
examining so you can come to a place
 
06:22:47.590 --> 06:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
where your view is objective right now
 
06:22:49.548 --> 06:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
we're living in a world where people
 
06:22:51.350 --> 06:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
like on both sides and nobody really
 
06:22:54.670 --> 06:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
wants to think about and bring us to to
 
06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
a place somewhere in the middle I don't
 
06:22:58.310 --> 06:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
know I'm elaborating too much here but
 
06:22:59.788 --> 06:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
you can tell I'm very passionate about
 
06:23:03.310 --> 06:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:05.468 --> 06:23:05.478 align:start position:0%
examples and any other
 
06:23:07.708 --> 06:23:07.718 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:23:09.310 --> 06:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
much all right thank you very much and
 
06:23:10.708 --> 06:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
and thank you for all you do because to
 
06:23:12.310 --> 06:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
be honest with you you guys spend a lot
 
06:23:16.910 --> 06:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:31.510 --> 06:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:34.070 --> 06:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
corello hello again uh thank you madam
 
06:23:36.150 --> 06:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
chair members of the education committee
 
06:23:37.868 --> 06:23:37.878 align:start position:0%
um I had initially planned to come up
 
06:23:39.990 --> 06:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
here today for the The Mask Bell that I
 
06:23:41.628 --> 06:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
previously spoke on for which I had
 
06:23:43.868 --> 06:23:43.878 align:start position:0%
prepared comments um this for this one
 
06:23:47.190 --> 06:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just speak from the heart
 
06:23:50.708 --> 06:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
um when I left my seventh grade class
 
06:23:53.070 --> 06:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
today uh in the middle of class to come
 
06:23:56.948 --> 06:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
up here um I left a video playing for
 
06:24:00.708 --> 06:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
them it was the uh second episode of a
 
06:24:01.910 --> 06:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
documentary series called the
 
06:24:03.628 --> 06:24:03.638 align:start position:0%
abolitionists and it featured Frederick
 
06:24:03.638 --> 06:24:04.910 align:start position:0%
abolitionists and it featured Frederick
Douglas

06:24:04.910 --> 06:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
Douglas
 
06:24:06.910 --> 06:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
and um I just thought that was sort of
 
06:24:08.750 --> 06:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
coincidental that now we're talking
 
06:24:10.948 --> 06:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
about this bill I remember a couple of
 
06:24:13.230 --> 06:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
years ago when this was
 
06:24:15.510 --> 06:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
um it was beginning of my term when it
 
06:24:18.628 --> 06:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
was brought up we filled rep's Hall
 
06:24:21.750 --> 06:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
with dozens and dozens of teachers who
 
06:24:23.190 --> 06:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
said they
 
06:24:26.468 --> 06:24:26.478 align:start position:0%
were they were they felt um afraid to
 
06:24:28.590 --> 06:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
teach certain subjects because they
 
06:24:32.270 --> 06:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
would be fired and um it included
 
06:24:34.070 --> 06:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
subjects of both the historical and
 
06:24:36.910 --> 06:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
current nature and
 
06:24:40.030 --> 06:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
um I just was sort of baffled because
 
06:24:41.868 --> 06:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
some people might even be afraid to
 
06:24:43.990 --> 06:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
teach The Narrative of the Life of
 
06:24:46.030 --> 06:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
Frederick Douglas an American slave
 
06:24:48.150 --> 06:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
which I've always taught even when I
 
06:24:50.590 --> 06:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
taught College freshman I I used it and
 
06:24:52.670 --> 06:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
now my sixth and seventh graders are
 
06:24:54.230 --> 06:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
reading it which is why I had them watch
 
06:24:59.788 --> 06:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
a little video first um what this
 
06:24:59.798 --> 06:25:02.190 align:start position:0%
a little video first um what this
bill

06:25:02.190 --> 06:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:25:06.190 --> 06:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
basically wants to do is is take away
 
06:25:06.200 --> 06:25:07.708 align:start position:0%
basically wants to do is is take away
the

06:25:07.708 --> 06:25:07.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:10.350 --> 06:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
um it wants to repeal the law that
 
06:25:13.190 --> 06:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
prohibits teachers from teaching
 
06:25:15.150 --> 06:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
students that certain groups of people
 
06:25:17.590 --> 06:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
are inherently Superior or inferior if
 
06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
you read to the original Law this this
 
06:25:23.070 --> 06:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
is a bill to repeal that um supporters
 
06:25:25.510 --> 06:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill object to the existing law
 
06:25:27.230 --> 06:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
they complain that it discourages
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
teachers from covering certain
 
06:25:31.750 --> 06:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
historical topics as I
 
06:25:36.110 --> 06:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:38.670 --> 06:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
what the current law basically says is
 
06:25:41.030 --> 06:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
that you know teachers
 
06:25:44.070 --> 06:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
can can teach that slave owners abuse
 
06:25:45.670 --> 06:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
slaves I mean I left my students
 
06:25:46.990 --> 06:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
watching this video where there was qu I
 
06:25:47.948 --> 06:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
had to give them a little trigger
 
06:25:50.390 --> 06:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
warning and say there's a really uh
 
06:25:54.910 --> 06:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
graphic scene of this um so um we can
 
06:25:56.468 --> 06:25:56.478 align:start position:0%
teach about the horrors of the
 
06:25:57.708 --> 06:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
institution of
 
06:26:00.390 --> 06:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
slavery we can't insinuate that students
 
06:26:03.070 --> 06:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
in their classrooms um that that that
 
06:26:04.990 --> 06:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
belong to a particular raal group should
 
06:26:07.350 --> 06:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
somehow feel guilt and shame over these
 
06:26:09.910 --> 06:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
events of the past that were in no
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
remote way their
 
06:26:13.868 --> 06:26:13.878 align:start position:0%
fault um because that that is what's
 
06:26:16.430 --> 06:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
happening i' I've heard anecdotes and I
 
06:26:18.468 --> 06:26:18.478 align:start position:0%
didn't again didn't prepare my remarks
 
06:26:20.190 --> 06:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
so I can't tell you specific ones but
 
06:26:22.628 --> 06:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
you know this this does happen sometimes
 
06:26:23.910 --> 06:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
where children will come home from
 
06:26:25.628 --> 06:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
school and and tell their parents that
 
06:26:27.468 --> 06:26:27.478 align:start position:0%
they were upset because they were made
 
06:26:30.468 --> 06:26:30.478 align:start position:0%
to feel that they were somehow um bad or
 
06:26:32.670 --> 06:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
or something um I'm just going to close
 
06:26:34.070 --> 06:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
with something I have my book here at
 
06:26:37.030 --> 06:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
the that's one of the reasons I I had in
 
06:26:39.310 --> 06:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
my bed when I left work um the thing
 
06:26:41.030 --> 06:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
about Frederick Douglas with a chapter
 
06:26:43.788 --> 06:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
that I find really inspiring because
 
06:26:45.830 --> 06:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we teach this to inspire okay
 
06:26:47.990 --> 06:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just history um this is
 
06:26:51.150 --> 06:26:51.160 align:start position:0%
teaching you how how to to treat people
 
06:26:54.150 --> 06:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
um Frederick Douglas had a a a mistress
 
06:26:55.868 --> 06:26:55.878 align:start position:0%
who was taught him how to read and write
 
06:26:58.230 --> 06:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
and she was very he describes her as
 
06:27:00.910 --> 06:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
kind tenderhearted woman um all sorts of
 
06:27:02.948 --> 06:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
very just Angelic woman and then
 
06:27:04.948 --> 06:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
suddenly she Chang and she wouldn't
 
06:27:06.910 --> 06:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
teach him how to read and write anymore
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
and what he said was that slavery proved
 
06:27:11.910 --> 06:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
as injurious to her as it did to me he
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
blamed the institution of slavery on her
 
06:27:16.510 --> 06:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
change but that she was an inherently
 
06:27:20.190 --> 06:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
good woman a good person and and that's
 
06:27:22.750 --> 06:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
what we need to teach the children is
 
06:27:24.150 --> 06:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
that people are inherent actually
 
06:27:25.750 --> 06:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
reminds me of an Frank who said that I
 
06:27:27.150 --> 06:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
believe that most people are inherently
 
06:27:31.270 --> 06:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
good um you know so anyway that's why I
 
06:27:33.708 --> 06:27:33.718 align:start position:0%
think it is so important that we keep
 
06:27:38.190 --> 06:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
the the law that we have um so that it
 
06:27:41.310 --> 06:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
um we can prevent the the issues that I
 
06:27:44.670 --> 06:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
raised here so um I would hope that you
 
06:27:49.910 --> 06:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
would vote itl on this bill so thank you
 
06:27:49.920 --> 06:27:50.990 align:start position:0%
would vote itl on this bill so thank you
any

06:27:50.990 --> 06:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:27:57.910 --> 06:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:06.590 --> 06:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:09.150 --> 06:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
need to change that just
 
06:28:11.590 --> 06:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
changeing uh Madam chair committee
 
06:28:13.230 --> 06:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
members Aubrey fredman I live in
 
06:28:15.548 --> 06:28:15.558 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater now this one I'm going to
 
06:28:15.558 --> 06:28:17.110 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater now this one I'm going to
oppose

06:28:17.110 --> 06:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
06:28:20.670 --> 06:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
so okay RSA
 
06:28:23.830 --> 06:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
19340 section 2 this is currently the
 
06:28:27.070 --> 06:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
law it's very clear in this
 
06:28:29.788 --> 06:28:29.798 align:start position:0%
section but it's saying nothing in this
 
06:28:31.670 --> 06:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
I'm quoting nothing in this section
 
06:28:34.708 --> 06:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
shall be conscrew to prohib it
 
06:28:37.830 --> 06:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
discussing again it says discussing as
 
06:28:40.430 --> 06:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
part of a larger course of academic
 
06:28:42.910 --> 06:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
instruction the
 
06:28:45.548 --> 06:28:45.558 align:start position:0%
historical uh existence of ideas and
 
06:28:48.990 --> 06:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
subjects identified in this section so
 
06:28:52.030 --> 06:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
when PE teachers say well we can't teach
 
06:28:55.150 --> 06:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
this stuff you can discuss it I mean you
 
06:28:59.230 --> 06:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
can talk about redlining slavery 1619
 
06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
project Stonewall Riot I mean any number
 
06:29:04.830 --> 06:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
of things that
 
06:29:08.670 --> 06:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh are kind of common Nazism whatever
 
06:29:11.190 --> 06:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's many things you can white
 
06:29:13.910 --> 06:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
supremacy you can discuss anything you
 
06:29:16.430 --> 06:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
just can't promote it that's the
 
06:29:18.868 --> 06:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
difference here
 
06:29:18.878 --> 06:29:20.390 align:start position:0%
difference here
so

06:29:20.390 --> 06:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:29:22.830 --> 06:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
teachers they need to check their
 
06:29:25.310 --> 06:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
politics at the front door and so when I
 
06:29:26.830 --> 06:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
was reading this bill I was thinking
 
06:29:30.110 --> 06:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
back to when I was in junior high and
 
06:29:33.110 --> 06:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
high school thinking about like uh
 
06:29:36.430 --> 06:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
social studies and history classes again
 
06:29:37.990 --> 06:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
this is many many years ago I still
 
06:29:41.230 --> 06:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
remember the teachers I don't really
 
06:29:44.190 --> 06:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
recall if they were Republican or
 
06:29:47.788 --> 06:29:47.798 align:start position:0%
Democrat conservative liberal communist
 
06:29:49.590 --> 06:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
it just there I have no memory of that
 
06:29:52.190 --> 06:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I remember them very clearly they
 
06:29:55.230 --> 06:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
checked their politics at the door and
 
06:29:56.830 --> 06:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
you really didn't they didn't push
 
06:29:59.150 --> 06:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
anything they were free to discuss and
 
06:30:01.670 --> 06:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's not any different but I do think
 
06:30:04.750 --> 06:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
some not all teachers do have a certain
 
06:30:07.110 --> 06:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
agenda that they are pushing in the
 
06:30:10.750 --> 06:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
classrooms and that is wrong you cannot
 
06:30:12.750 --> 06:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
just like any other employee they are
 
06:30:15.788 --> 06:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
employees of the taxpayers you you have
 
06:30:18.310 --> 06:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
to follow the rules you can't just teach
 
06:30:20.310 --> 06:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
whatever you want and the law right now
 
06:30:22.948 --> 06:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
says you can discuss things but you
 
06:30:27.270 --> 06:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
cannot promote your Pol promoting racism
 
06:30:31.788 --> 06:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
sexism victimhood these are evil things
 
06:30:34.230 --> 06:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
to be promoting and you should be figh
 
06:30:35.590 --> 06:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned if you're
 
06:30:37.990 --> 06:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
promoting them if you're just discussing
 
06:30:41.070 --> 06:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
them that's good that's what a teacher
 
06:30:45.270 --> 06:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
does so group think is bad and I think
 
06:30:49.830 --> 06:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's especially bad for teachers to be
 
06:30:52.110 --> 06:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh we should be promoting individuals
 
06:30:54.910 --> 06:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
the rights of individuals uh we're not
 
06:30:59.230 --> 06:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
mindless cogs in a in a tribe we are all
 
06:31:01.788 --> 06:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
individuals and that's what and if
 
06:31:04.350 --> 06:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
actually teachers are really interested
 
06:31:07.310 --> 06:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
in helping uh the ones in protective
 
06:31:09.910 --> 06:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
classes we should be raising the
 
06:31:12.868 --> 06:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
academic standards that will actually
 
06:31:15.750 --> 06:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
help them the most rather than pushing
 
06:31:19.230 --> 06:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
politics so that's why I oppose this
 
06:31:21.868 --> 06:31:21.878 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any
 
06:31:23.948 --> 06:31:23.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:31:27.708 --> 06:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:39.868 --> 06:31:39.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:41.708 --> 06:31:41.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chair and members of
 
06:31:44.388 --> 06:31:44.398 align:start position:0%
the committee Ian huitt appearing for
 
06:31:47.830 --> 06:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone in opposition I really
 
06:31:50.510 --> 06:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
enjoyed uh representative petrino's
 
06:31:52.468 --> 06:31:52.478 align:start position:0%
testimony in large part because as the
 
06:31:54.270 --> 06:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
saying goes I think about the Roman
 
06:31:56.590 --> 06:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
Empire every day I like studying Roman
 
06:31:59.388 --> 06:31:59.398 align:start position:0%
history and thinking about it I like
 
06:32:00.910 --> 06:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about parallels between
 
06:32:02.628 --> 06:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
American history and Roman history I
 
06:32:05.310 --> 06:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
like talking about it and I noticed
 
06:32:07.468 --> 06:32:07.478 align:start position:0%
though that I've always managed to do
 
06:32:10.270 --> 06:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
that without ever saying that any group
 
06:32:12.150 --> 06:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
of people should face discrimination
 
06:32:13.948 --> 06:32:13.958 align:start position:0%
because of their race or that any group
 
06:32:16.350 --> 06:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
of people is inherently privileged or
 
06:32:18.868 --> 06:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
racist because of their race and so I
 
06:32:20.468 --> 06:32:20.478 align:start position:0%
think that it should be easy for
 
06:32:22.468 --> 06:32:22.478 align:start position:0%
teachers to make that distinction as
 
06:32:25.190 --> 06:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
well I think there is often kind of a
 
06:32:27.590 --> 06:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
mod and Bailey that goes on around this
 
06:32:30.788 --> 06:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
bill because if you take a look at judge
 
06:32:33.350 --> 06:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
barbadoro injunction saying that this
 
06:32:36.468 --> 06:32:36.478 align:start position:0%
law can cannot be enforced at no point
 
06:32:39.430 --> 06:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
does Judge barbadoro say the problem
 
06:32:41.190 --> 06:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
with this law is it will prohibit
 
06:32:43.030 --> 06:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
teaching about ancient Germanic
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
migration he does not say the problem is
 
06:32:47.110 --> 06:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
it will prohibit teaching about the
 
06:32:49.788 --> 06:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
Holocaust he says the problem looking at
 
06:32:52.708 --> 06:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
page 27 of the U opinion letter is that
 
06:32:54.868 --> 06:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
this may deter teachers from teaching
 
06:32:57.788 --> 06:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
about the benefits of affirmative action
 
06:32:58.948 --> 06:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
and he goes on to talk about how
 
06:33:00.910 --> 06:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
affirmative action is important because
 
06:33:03.350 --> 06:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
it remedies past discrimination and
 
06:33:03.360 --> 06:33:04.310 align:start position:0%
it remedies past discrimination and
promotes

06:33:04.310 --> 06:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
promotes
 
06:33:07.670 --> 06:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
diversity so as I move between as I
 
06:33:09.948 --> 06:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
often do legislative advocacy and
 
06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional litigation which I often
 
06:33:14.628 --> 06:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
do I often see on contentious issues
 
06:33:17.270 --> 06:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
like this certain groups will make very
 
06:33:19.510 --> 06:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
different arguments to bodies like this
 
06:33:21.230 --> 06:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
one that they will make in front of a
 
06:33:23.910 --> 06:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
judge and in this case I notice that
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
often the argument before legislative
 
06:33:28.230 --> 06:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
committees is this is deterring us from
 
06:33:30.868 --> 06:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
teaching about the Holocaust and yet in
 
06:33:34.190 --> 06:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
court the argument is we want to teach
 
06:33:36.468 --> 06:33:36.478 align:start position:0%
that affirmative action is beneficial
 
06:33:39.590 --> 06:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
AKA that white students should face
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination and so I think if the
 
06:33:44.788 --> 06:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
judge can tell what this law is
 
06:33:47.070 --> 06:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
prohibiting well enough to say that's
 
06:33:48.670 --> 06:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
precisely why I'm going to enjoin it
 
06:33:51.070 --> 06:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
because I object to that prohibition
 
06:33:52.990 --> 06:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
then teachers also really can tell what
 
06:33:55.350 --> 06:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's prohibiting and not prohibiting now
 
06:33:57.468 --> 06:33:57.478 align:start position:0%
potentially the current law could be
 
06:33:59.830 --> 06:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
amended to overcome the current
 
06:34:01.990 --> 06:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
injunction but I think ultimately
 
06:34:04.190 --> 06:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
politically everyone really does does
 
06:34:06.190 --> 06:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
understand what this law prohibits and
 
06:34:08.070 --> 06:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
litigation like this litigation shows
 
06:34:10.270 --> 06:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
that I would be happy to answer any
 
06:34:12.708 --> 06:34:12.718 align:start position:0%

litigation so I'd love to take any
 
06:34:18.750 --> 06:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions about the constitutionality of
 
06:34:21.230 --> 06:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
this law or its enforcement mechanism or
 
06:34:24.150 --> 06:34:24.160 align:start position:0%

Advocate um I don't support the bill e
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
there I um I I do think that there's
 
06:35:11.430 --> 06:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
other things that we can be doing to
 
06:35:15.070 --> 06:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
help um improve on some of these
 
06:35:17.230 --> 06:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
subjects that I'm going to bring up uh
 
06:35:21.270 --> 06:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 193 col 40 addresses a worldview
 
06:35:23.708 --> 06:35:23.718 align:start position:0%
that has been permeating some public
 
06:35:26.150 --> 06:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
schools for several years now and this
 
06:35:28.190 --> 06:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
worldview has been described as critical
 
06:35:30.030 --> 06:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
race Theory but I think a better
 
06:35:31.670 --> 06:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
accurate term would be called a
 
06:35:31.680 --> 06:35:33.670 align:start position:0%
accurate term would be called a
anti-racism

06:35:33.670 --> 06:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
anti-racism
 
06:35:37.628 --> 06:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
and 193 col 40 appears to be restricting
 
06:35:39.868 --> 06:35:39.878 align:start position:0%
schools from teaching or requiring
 
06:35:42.150 --> 06:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
students to adhere to a specific world
 
06:35:45.990 --> 06:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
view anti-racists PE PE um place people
 
06:35:48.548 --> 06:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
into two different categories one
 
06:35:50.150 --> 06:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
category includes people who are
 
06:35:53.230 --> 06:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
inherently Su Superior and the other to
 
06:35:55.788 --> 06:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
the other category of people children
 
06:35:58.270 --> 06:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
are being coached in the anti-racist
 
06:36:01.230 --> 06:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
world view K to2 in some K to2
 
06:36:03.350 --> 06:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
classrooms so where does this world view
 
06:36:05.430 --> 06:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
come from and where have we seen it in
 
06:36:07.830 --> 06:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
the public schools in New Hampshire in
 
06:36:11.150 --> 06:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
sau6 administrators spent
 
06:36:14.310 --> 06:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
$20,000 on a book called this book is
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
anti-racist and this book was purchased
 
06:36:17.990 --> 06:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
for middle school
 
06:36:20.990 --> 06:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
students the self-described ards you go
 
06:36:22.868 --> 06:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
through the social study standards and
 
06:36:24.990 --> 06:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
you make sure that what is required to
 
06:36:27.430 --> 06:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
be taught in the classroom is included
 
06:36:30.590 --> 06:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
in those standards we can do that as a
 
06:36:32.190 --> 06:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
state you can go to the commissioner you
 
06:36:33.990 --> 06:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
can go to the State Board of Education
 
06:36:36.110 --> 06:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
and make that requirement of them that
 
06:36:38.510 --> 06:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
is exactly what they did in Florida they
 
06:36:41.468 --> 06:36:41.478 align:start position:0%
added African American history standards
 
06:36:43.910 --> 06:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
to their academic standards and if you
 
06:36:45.868 --> 06:36:45.878 align:start position:0%
go through them 20 Pages which I went
 
06:36:48.868 --> 06:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
through and read them I think everybody
 
06:36:51.030 --> 06:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
in this room might learn something maybe
 
06:36:53.310 --> 06:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
the social studies teachers would not
 
06:36:54.868 --> 06:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
but I think everybody would learn
 
06:36:58.230 --> 06:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
something from they're very good um one
 
06:37:00.948 --> 06:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
of the standards says Identify American
 
06:37:03.548 --> 06:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
a Americans African-Americans who
 
06:37:06.388 --> 06:37:06.398 align:start position:0%
demonstrated heroism patriotism wouldn't
 
06:37:07.788 --> 06:37:07.798 align:start position:0%
that be a nice thing to learn so they
 
06:37:10.150 --> 06:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
bring up you know they give examples tus
 
06:37:12.750 --> 06:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
skiggy Airman Martin Luther King Jr Rosa
 
06:37:15.708 --> 06:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
Parks uh one says describe the history
 
06:37:18.510 --> 06:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
and evolution of slave codes I suspect
 
06:37:20.750 --> 06:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
that our kids aren't learning this a lot
 
06:37:22.788 --> 06:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
of this in in school and we do have an
 
06:37:25.388 --> 06:37:25.398 align:start position:0%
Avenue to do that so th those are just
 
06:37:27.670 --> 06:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
my suggestions
 
06:37:31.510 --> 06:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
um work on the standards and include
 
06:37:33.868 --> 06:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
various viewpoints in the school thank
 
06:37:35.590 --> 06:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
you very much any
 
06:37:38.070 --> 06:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you very much
 
06:37:46.510 --> 06:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:48.750 --> 06:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
Chester thank you committee chair thank
 
06:37:50.910 --> 06:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
you committee members Russ anchester
 
06:37:53.670 --> 06:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire um I am running
 
06:37:56.150 --> 06:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
for a school board in my town and I had
 
06:37:57.670 --> 06:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to meet with the
 
06:37:59.990 --> 06:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools because I'm
 
06:38:01.670 --> 06:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
truly interested in being the best
 
06:38:04.070 --> 06:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
school board member that I can be
 
06:38:07.270 --> 06:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
during that interview um he identified
 
06:38:08.910 --> 06:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
the perfect Schoolboard member as
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
someone that does their homework and is
 
06:38:14.388 --> 06:38:14.398 align:start position:0%
open-minded to look at why one side
 
06:38:16.868 --> 06:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
would support a position and the other
 
06:38:18.990 --> 06:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
side would support a direct opposite
 
06:38:21.510 --> 06:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
position and use your critical thinking
 
06:38:23.670 --> 06:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
skills to come up what's truly in the
 
06:38:25.948 --> 06:38:25.958 align:start position:0%
best interest of the children what's
 
06:38:28.150 --> 06:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
interesting is when you walk into a
 
06:38:32.230 --> 06:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
classroom and you see a specific flag as
 
06:38:34.788 --> 06:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
an adult there's all kinds of things
 
06:38:37.670 --> 06:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
going on in your mind is that flag there
 
06:38:40.110 --> 06:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
because they're an ally is that flag
 
06:38:44.388 --> 06:38:44.398 align:start position:0%
there because they identify etc etc okay
 
06:38:46.948 --> 06:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
children developmentally are not in a
 
06:38:49.230 --> 06:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
place to try to do that so bringing that
 
06:38:52.670 --> 06:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
into the classroom can be problematic
 
06:38:54.070 --> 06:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
what's really interesting for our
 
06:38:56.948 --> 06:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
teachers is that if teachers are worried
 
06:39:00.030 --> 06:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
about um teaching something and being
 
06:39:04.070 --> 06:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
accused of being racist or LGBT TQ plus
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
Ally or whatever um what's really
 
06:39:09.670 --> 06:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
interesting is artificial um
 
06:39:13.110 --> 06:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
intelligence does a great job explaining
 
06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
what is and what is not CRT what is and
 
06:39:19.750 --> 06:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
what is not seal what is and what is not
 
06:39:22.350 --> 06:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
Dei and what's really interesting is all
 
06:39:25.788 --> 06:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
three of those started during the Civil
 
06:39:28.628 --> 06:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
Revolution the Civil Rights revolution
 
06:39:31.030 --> 06:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
in closing the bottom line is
 
06:39:33.788 --> 06:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
discrimination is discrimination the
 
06:39:37.510 --> 06:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill that's in place now does protect
 
06:39:39.910 --> 06:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
that and our children we should not be
 
06:39:42.310 --> 06:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
worried about a protective class
 
06:39:45.150 --> 06:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't all our children be
 
06:39:48.750 --> 06:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
protected thank you very much any
 
06:39:51.948 --> 06:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
questions R Woodcock than just a quick
 
06:39:53.190 --> 06:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
summary I couldn't figure out if you're
 
06:39:54.990 --> 06:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
for or against the bill I am opposed to
 
06:39:56.510 --> 06:39:56.520 align:start position:0%

natural part of the human experience and
 
06:41:23.548 --> 06:41:23.558 align:start position:0%
we need to challenge stereotypes and

biases about their abilities and their

participation ableism which is

societal attitude teaching people to
 
06:41:47.868 --> 06:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
believe that people with disabilities
 
06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
are less than or deficient in some way
 
06:41:54.788 --> 06:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
to combat ableism we must be able to use
 
06:41:57.388 --> 06:41:57.398 align:start position:0%
the real life examples and experiences
 
06:41:58.708 --> 06:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
of groups of people who have

barriers that are ablest in nature they
 
06:42:15.868 --> 06:42:15.878 align:start position:0%
often serve as a front line in

and intentional design to include people

with disabilities but this can only
 
06:42:32.030 --> 06:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
happen if people are taught about
 
06:42:34.350 --> 06:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination and depression to correct
 
06:42:37.230 --> 06:42:37.240 align:start position:0%

interwoven into all aspects of History
 
06:43:04.708 --> 06:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's important for students to
 
06:43:06.910 --> 06:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
understand what was like what life was
 
06:43:08.990 --> 06:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
like for people before these protections
 
06:43:11.510 --> 06:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
were passed and how these protections
 
06:43:14.110 --> 06:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
impact themselves and their

50 thank you everybody and we're going
 
06:44:15.150 --> 06:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
to reopen our executive session for uh a
 
06:44:19.430 --> 06:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
moment um I would like to take up House
 
06:44:24.590 --> 06:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 362 we discussed it briefly um and
 
06:44:28.670 --> 06:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh we're comparing that with House Bill
 
06:44:32.510 --> 06:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
440 and um I did have conversation with
 
06:44:34.110 --> 06:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
06:44:38.230 --> 06:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
education and um Mr applebe thought that
 
06:44:42.070 --> 06:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
the language in House Bill 440 which we
 
06:44:44.948 --> 06:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh did pass yesterday I guess it seems
 
06:44:48.868 --> 06:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
like a long time ago um would eliminate
 
06:44:50.788 --> 06:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
the need for the
 
06:44:53.590 --> 06:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
waiver um I have not heard back from Mr
 
06:44:59.150 --> 06:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
beard but I assume that since Mr um
 
06:45:02.628 --> 06:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
applebe um is in agreement on 440 as was
 
06:45:07.388 --> 06:45:07.398 align:start position:0%
Mr feed um we can go with House Bill 440
 
06:45:13.230 --> 06:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
so I will move that we retain House Bill
 
06:45:16.590 --> 06:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
362 um in the event that
 
06:45:19.670 --> 06:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
um uh multiple people in Department get
 
06:45:21.510 --> 06:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
together and have multiple opinions and
 
06:45:23.230 --> 06:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
we still have house build
 
06:45:28.430 --> 06:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
362 and um if no further need um is
 
06:45:30.590 --> 06:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
