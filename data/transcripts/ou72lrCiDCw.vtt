clerk I've spoken to him and he's agreed
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
to it and his uh
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
Mr McCullough will be taking notes for
 
00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 align:start position:0%
this meeting
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
the minute the draft minutes from the
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
previous meeting
 
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 align:start position:0%
are being posted on the
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
Committee website
 
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.249 align:start position:0%
Committee website
which

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
are public once we approve them the
 
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
draft notice will be taken off and I'll
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
try to get the minutes posted after
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
every meeting so that they can be read
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.990 align:start position:0%
all right
the

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
we don't have a very long agenda but I
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
would like to make sure that we schedule
 
00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:24.419 align:start position:0%
further meetings because
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
due to the legislative scheduling system
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
it is much easier to cancel or change a
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
meeting than it is to create one so I'd
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
like to suggest that we schedule a
 
00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
meeting every week Thursday afternoon
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
unless there is a lot of opposition to
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie you look concerned I
 
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
thought Senator Bradley has microphone
 
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.070 align:start position:0%
thought Senator Bradley has microphone
off

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
oh that's okay
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
Senator did you wish to comment nope
 
00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:02.930 align:start position:0%
Senator did you wish to comment nope
okay

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
all right then we'll
 
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.449 align:start position:0%
all right then we'll
um

00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:08.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
sounds like there is no great objection
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
so I'll do that Thursday at 1 probably
 
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.470 align:start position:0%
so I'll do that Thursday at 1 probably
here

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
the reason for the regular meetings is
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
that we have a very wide-ranging
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
charge here
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
and we'll need some time to figure out
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
exactly how to tackle it right not just
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know what are we going to do but how
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
are we going to do it and we have a
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
report due on December 1st
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
which will
 
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
just barely let us get some legislation
 
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.870 align:start position:0%
just barely let us get some legislation
in

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
for this coming year
 
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
it um I know that the in the house
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
commit committees and commissions can go
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
to the rules committee and get late
 
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
introduced bills and that's probably
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
what we're going to have to do
 
00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:08.810 align:start position:0%
what we're going to have to do
so

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
that case we're down to the important
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
stuff the discussion
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
and does anyone have a have a comment or
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
concern or topic that I think we need to
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
bring to the commission
 
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
 
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.889 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
so

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:33.889 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:35.389 align:start position:0%
 
when

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
we debated this provision in the budget
 
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.110 align:start position:0%
we debated this provision in the budget
um

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie brought forward an
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
um I think is substantially similar to
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
what I am
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know gonna at least throw out there
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
and the reason for you know putting
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
something out there and I have two
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
different versions of it this is the
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
first version that's being circulated
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
and there should be enough copies for
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's vitally important that
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you that we actually have accurate
 
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.490 align:start position:0%
thank you that we actually have accurate
information

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
um the provision that the house passed
 
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
over to us in the budget
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
it came to us as
 
00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:40.790 align:start position:0%
it came to us as
um

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
10 years 25 million dollars a year but
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
there were Actuarial analysis that said
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
if we pre-funded everything which is
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
what we did in 2022 with House Bill 1587
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
it was 134 million dollars and
 
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to do it something like
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
that so that there's no implication that
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
the state is going to
 
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
pass the cost of any new benefit back to
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
the counties or the municipalities I
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
think we would have to discuss what the
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
ongoing costs of the municipalities if
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
we get that far but in any case what you
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
have in front of you
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
is a version of Senator soucy's
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment which only increases the
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
multiplier to 2.5 percent for
 
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.100 align:start position:0%
those individuals and I believe they're
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
1824 of them that
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
had been hired
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
as group 2 employees prior to July 1 of
 
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.069 align:start position:0%
as group 2 employees prior to July 1 of
2011.

00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
2011.
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
I think we need to get that costed out
 
00:13:02.569 --> 00:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
the one change I think from Senator
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
soucy's amendment is I did not change
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
the existing retirement date as some of
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
the other versions
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
have done so that we have an analysis of
 
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.730 align:start position:0%
have done so that we have an analysis of
what

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
keeping the current 25 years of service
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
and 50-year age of retirement in place
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
I think that should be costed out
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
more or less what senator soucy
 
00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339 align:start position:0%
introduced with the exception of the
 
00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:39.769 align:start position:0%
introduced with the exception of the
um

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:40.970 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
dates for the retirement of 25 years of
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
service and 50 years of age as I recall
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
from the debate that we had on the floor
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and the budget which the
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
Senate did not vote for it but I think
 
00:13:59.530 --> 00:13:59.540 align:start position:0%
there was some indication that we should
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
examine it
 
00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:05.339 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
what I would like to put out there for
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
discussion now
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
the policy of
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Retirement System in
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
Services is that without a actual bill
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
they can't go to the actuaries GRS and
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
acts for an Actuarial analysis and I
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
think if we're going to commit to the
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
kind of resources that
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
um you know are at stake here we need
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
good numbers I've spoken with the
 
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.670 align:start position:0%
good numbers I've spoken with the
speaker

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
and we've spoken to our Chiefs of Staff
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
the two of us have the authority to
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
utilize consultant monies in the both
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate
 
00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.329 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate
um

00:14:58.329 --> 00:14:58.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
discretionary funds and we've spoken
 
00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
discretionary funds and we've spoken
about

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
the speaker Packard and I have spoken
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
about using that from my point of view I
 
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.329 align:start position:0%
about using that from my point of view I
am

00:15:07.329 --> 00:15:07.339 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
more than happy to entertain that I
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
think we should do that because I think
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
that waiting until
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
January for a bill with an Actuarial
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
analysis is
 
00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:25.019 align:start position:0%
um it just defeats the purpose of what
 
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
this commission should be about which is
 
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
collecting information and making
 
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.769 align:start position:0%
collecting information and making
proposals

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh Marty Carlin who couldn't be here
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
today but folks from the retirement
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
system are here has told me that the
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
cost of an analysis like that is in the
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
upper range of about five thousand
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
dollars so I think it's something that
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
um is you know certainly something that
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
afford to do and should do so that is
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
version number one
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
version number two uh Senator I think
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
that we should
 
00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:03.949 align:start position:0%
that we should
um

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
see if there are any comments on them
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay fine
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
from other people before we look at
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
other other suggestions but I strongly
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
agree that once the commission agrees
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
that something is worth
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
analyzing we should get the Actuarial
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
analysis five or ten thousand dollars is
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
well worth
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
um the effort right so does anyone have
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
have a comment on this change this
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
this is only for group two who who were
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
retired were employed but not vested in
 
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.670 align:start position:0%
retired were employed but not vested in
2011.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
2011.
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair yes I um would just like
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
to agree 100 with uh Senator Bradley and
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
we I as he said we have talked about
 
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.389 align:start position:0%
we I as he said we have talked about
this

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
and you know I think the biggest problem
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
that we had with Senator soucy's uh
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment at the last minute was we
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
really didn't have any numbers
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure how we're going to
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
effectively move forward without the
 
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:05.990 align:start position:0%
effectively move forward without the
numbers

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
and I'm sitting here today saying I want
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
to fix this thing once and for all
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
so whatever we need I hope that we can
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
attain so that we can do the job and do
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
somebody must say oh yes Mr mccola uh
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
McAllister thank you chairman that's
 
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
okay uh is it possible as well to look
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
into the the numbers and see if we can
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
run the numbers for
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
increasing the multiplier for all
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
members including the ones that had come
 
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a suggestion
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to look at
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
those numbers as well uh since one of
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
the topics that we have been talking
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
about for many years now is the uh
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
recruitment as well as retaining members
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the fire service as well as police
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
I mean we certainly could look at it
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
I I think that all the bills that were
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
introduced As I understood them
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
um dealt with the 1824 people that were
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
hired prior
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
to July of 2011 so expanding it I think
 
00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
to July of 2011 so expanding it I think
um

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
while I understand that a lot of people
 
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
would like to do that and maybe a
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
retention benefit
 
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.130 align:start position:0%
retention benefit
um

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
I suspect the price tag is
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
extremely high and you will be
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
potentially pitting group two against
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
group one and we're suddenly into you
 
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:52.700 align:start position:0%
know a
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
Blockbuster spending initiative I think
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
that the focus
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
at least in my opinion would be much
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
better on the 1824 individuals that
 
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
better on the 1824 individuals that
um

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
had been hired
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
prior to January of 11 but if the
 
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.310 align:start position:0%
prior to January of 11 but if the
committee

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
wants to you know have that analysis
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
done I think that's not necessarily A
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
bad number to have but I doubt very much
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I would find
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
the ability to be able to support that
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm just being upfront about it right
 
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.669 align:start position:0%
so I'm just being upfront about it right
now

00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
and um actually I believe it's down to
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
1730 individuals
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
but anyway Senator Gray
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
uh certainly the discussions that we had
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
during the budget negotiations uh
 
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:51.500 align:start position:0%
covered a lot of different things
 
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system and certainly
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
retention is one of the things that we
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
looked at the proposal that we received
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
from the house I don't believe
 
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:06.020 align:start position:0%
did the right things in retention
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
because it actually made it easier for
 
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:10.700 align:start position:0%
people to retire earlier
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
and went back and did all the
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
retroactive things so for the bulk of
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
the employees covered in group two they
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
weren't mentioned they weren't addressed
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
and therefore it had no impact on them
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things I did ask the
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
retirement system to do is to look at a
 
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
plan that would at either 20 years or 30
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
years or whatever increase slightly the
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
multiplier for all employees so that to
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
people even in the affected individuals
 
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.289 align:start position:0%
people even in the affected individuals
the

00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:47.299 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.340 align:start position:0%
1824 if you weren't up at at least a
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
2.25 that at 20 years you would go to
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
2.25 and then at say 30 years you would
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
go 2825 and if that were for all
 
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.450 align:start position:0%
go 2825 and if that were for all
employees

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:04.460 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
then certainly that could help the
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
retention of your employees
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
and it would help to reduce the cost
 
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:21.020 align:start position:0%
impact because the non-rail track
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
retroactivity okay means that I don't
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
have to go pay for
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
the reductions that we did before the
 
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
other thing that I did talk to people in
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
administrative Services about uh would
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
affect in my opinion both group one and
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
group two and that would be allowing for
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
a matching of contributions to the 401
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
403 Thrift Savings whatever you want to
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
call it but that would be a negotiated
 
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:56.780 align:start position:0%
benefit so that if
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
organization came in and said well yeah
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
we're ready to negotiate our new
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
contract and we would like five percent
 
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:09.980 align:start position:0%
two in match and three in you know wages
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
that that would be a possibility up to
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
whatever limit that we set and that
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
would be outside of the retirement
 
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:21.020 align:start position:0%
system itself but still
 
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
in keeping with a lot of the retirement
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
plans that are out there
 
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.750 align:start position:0%
plans that are out there
um

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
right now I've looked at colas I've
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
looked at other things and certainly in
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
it gets to be too expensive very quickly
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
so certainly interested in the numbers
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
coming out on a lot of this stuff but
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
like I say a match for
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh the employees who are making
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
contributions to some kind of a a
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
retirement plan uh
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
you know is something that would only
 
00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:02.059 align:start position:0%
affect the state employees
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
on our dime it would be a negotiated
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
thing with the people who are employed
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
by the localities they would be
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
responsible for for theirs just as they
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
are other benefits so there's a lot of
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
issues out there and certainly Senator
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
Bradley has given us one so far he's got
 
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
more but there's a lot of things out
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
there but but to get this through the
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
Senate it has to be affordable and it
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
has to be sustainable
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay those are the the keys that I see
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
on getting a good vote in whatever we
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
in Senate thank you
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
but Senator Susie thank you madam chair
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things one um actually is
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
a question for Senator Bradley I'm
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment that you
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
distributed which is in part similar to
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I had submitted at
 
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
the end of the budget process but I
 
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
noticed that you've taken out the
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
provisions relative to disability
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
retirement and I'm wondering if that was
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
intentional or not because that was part
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that I introduced it's
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
also part of Representative goalies bill
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can answer that question
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
right now I I intended the amendment to
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
be comprehensive so
 
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
be comprehensive so
um

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:33.500 align:start position:0%
if that
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
evidently is not in there it probably
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
should be it needs to address disability
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
okay and then if I may further I just
 
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
um agree with
 
00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:46.850 align:start position:0%
um agree with
uh

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
Mr McAllister that if if we're going to
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
entertain the proposal I think it makes
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
good sense in terms of utilizing our
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
resources uh to make an ask that looks
 
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
at a broader array of numbers now I
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
agree that's not necessarily where we'll
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
end up but I think having the
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
information will help guide our decision
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
making more quickly and then I do hope
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
that given the as the chair identified
 
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
sort of the broad swath of
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we would also be
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
looking at other things such as a cola
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
that would impact a sustainable Cola
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
that would impact both groups that are
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
in the system I think that would
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
probably be the next topic I hope we
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
could address thank you madam chair yeah
 
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:36.260 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
this amendment and the other amendment I
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
believe Senator Bradley is bringing
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
forth is a short-term fix to deal with
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that were created by
 
00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.750 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that were created by
the

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.130 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
severe problems we had in 2011. this is
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
a focused change
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
and it really only affects a small group
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
I'd like to spend the next meeting
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
essentially looking at what kind of
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
changes we might consider
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system in the longer
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
term and also how would we
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
what what priorities would we have what
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be our emphasis and what how would
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
we decide if it's a good change or a bad
 
00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:28.130 align:start position:0%
we decide if it's a good change or a bad
change

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
I think we need to do that there are so
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
many choices and so many options and the
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
retirement system has so many moving
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
parts we need to narrow it down a little
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
so any anyone else have a comment on
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and just in a
 
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
sense to you know I want to thank
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley for bringing this
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
forward and Senator Susie for the
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
framework that she provided for it and
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
my feeling aligns with what that you
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
just said Madam chair is that I would
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
hope that we could focus on two things I
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
think we ought to focus on what we might
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
potentially bring forward in the
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
framework of what Senator Bradley has
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
given us for but a bill the potential
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
could be done on veto day
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
I think we also then as you suggested
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
the next meeting look at the broader
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
context the larger issue of the
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
multipliers the colas I have some ideas
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
about doing an opt out instead of an
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
opt-in on the um additional 401 programs
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
which is you recall Madam chair we
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
discussed in the San Diego pension
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
commission and those other things and I
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
think that you know I think there is a
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
bifurcation about there what we might
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
potentially be able to do on veto day
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
and then what are what we might
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
recommend as bills will be introduced in
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
a regular session thank you okay thank
 
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.130 align:start position:0%
a regular session thank you okay thank
you

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
referred from all the senators does
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.409 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
all the senatorial oars were in the
 
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.430 align:start position:0%
all the senatorial oars were in the
water

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
yes yes and I this is not just the
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislative commission so I'm hoping
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
that we had some other
 
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:21.419 align:start position:0%
comments about this plan I have one and
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
that's when we were talking when we were
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
considering changes this year
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
one issue that kept coming up
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
primarily with corrections but also with
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
other group too is the years of service
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
was it was an issue
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
they that
 
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.450 align:start position:0%
they that
um

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts still has 20 years for 50
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
percent pay and
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
working an extra four years is a major
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
issue for some people and
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's that's in your
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
other other plan Senator Bradley but uh
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
Mr McAllister you got a comment or
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
um no I don't have a comment on that um
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
but are we still brainstorming here okay
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
well in that case Senator your other
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair this version is
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
um slightly different than the previous
 
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
version and I think it is something that
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
um should also be looked at in terms of
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
the actuaries it
 
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.230 align:start position:0%
the actuaries it
um

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
for anybody with less than five years of
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
service the multiplier of two one and
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
two two would go to
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
2.25 so it is obviously meant to
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
have less of a cost
 
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.269 align:start position:0%
have less of a cost
um

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
which I think gets me to one of the big
 
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
picture items that you know this
 
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.070 align:start position:0%
picture items that you know this
Commission

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
and everybody that's on any of the
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
finance committees in the House and
 
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.549 align:start position:0%
finance committees in the House and
Senate

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:29.210 align:start position:0%
Senate
um

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
is going to have to deal with as we
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
consider what we might do in terms of
 
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.169 align:start position:0%
consider what we might do in terms of
retirement

00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
those of us that are on the fiscal
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee heard a pretty compelling
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh testimony from the administrator or
 
00:30:47.289 --> 00:30:47.299 align:start position:0%
the sununu
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
Center lawsuits that are ongoing and
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
as all of us that are legislators know
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
um Karen umberger's Bill the pass
 
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
dedicated 100 million dollars to
 
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.130 align:start position:0%
dedicated 100 million dollars to
settling

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:03.140 align:start position:0%
settling
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
those claims and I think
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
certainly Justice Broderick
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
has indicated that he feels that is
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
going to be too low
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
so that is a big picture item that
 
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
as we think about what we're going to do
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
here how we're going to pay for it we
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
have to be aware of we can't avoid
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
um that elephant in the room the second
 
00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:33.950 align:start position:0%
um that elephant in the room the second
thing

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.850 align:start position:0%
thing
um

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
our revenue for July and July is one of
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
the smallest months of Revenue in the
 
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.490 align:start position:0%
the smallest months of Revenue in the
year

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
I was off four million dollars I think
 
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
that we also need to be very cognizant
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
of where revenue is as this commission
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
unfolds its work especially if we're
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
do something in the way that we did
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1587
 
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:06.740 align:start position:0%
in 2022 the beauty of House Bill 1587
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
we put 42.9 million dollars into an
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
enhanced benefit for those tier B folks
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
in group two there's no question
 
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
of whether that funding you know will be
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
there to pay for that benefit a future
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
legislature can't send it down to the
 
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
municipalities or the counties and I
 
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
think that that is vitally important in
 
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
whatever we do
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
that it not be funded in the way that
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
the house sent us the budget which was
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
an allocation of 25 million dollars a
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
year for 10 years that's a recipe in my
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
opinion for
 
00:32:51.899 --> 00:32:54.250 align:start position:0%
opinion for
um

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
downshifting to the counties of
 
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities so
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
I I think we have to keep a very close
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
eye on revenue and I would Echo what
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
Senator gray said in terms of the Senate
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I think we want to solve this problem
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
but at the same time
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
um we have to have something that is
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
sustainable and affordable and if you
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
look back to you know where we were in
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
2011 and I really appreciate some of the
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
things that the municipal Association
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
has said about turning the corner
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
finally 12 years later with
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
um you know sustainability and rates
 
00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:36.889 align:start position:0%
um you know sustainability and rates
that

00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
um employers pay and let's remember who
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
employers are employers are generally
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
for municipality schools and counties
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
are property taxpayers so we've made
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
significant progress and so to me
 
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.690 align:start position:0%
significant progress and so to me
um

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
and the spirit of this amendment is to
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
make its hopefully a little bit more
 
00:34:02.529 --> 00:34:02.539 align:start position:0%
affordable so that for those 1824 people
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
we might be able to get the consensus
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
going forward and that's why I would
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
hope that we would ask for it to be
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:20.690 align:start position:0%
 
comment

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
can I asked a question Madam chair yes
 
00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
can I asked a question Madam chair yes
please

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
um so Senator Bradley you've heard some
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
suggestions about some other things to
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
be looked at and I I guess the question
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
would really be to you and the speaker
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
before we'd you know have some
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
recommendation about what how broad
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at different
 
00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:40.820 align:start position:0%
things like the the call or the
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
multiplier for everybody
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
um do you and the speaker believe that
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
the funding that you're looking at will
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
be adequate to cover
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
um several asks we've got two here and
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
then for the consultant yeah well I
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
think I think that and maybe the folks
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system can comment on
 
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system can comment on
this

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
I I think that the funding necessary to
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
analyze these things because they're the
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
second one is the subset of the first
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
one should be relatively easy for the
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
actuaries to be able to determine and in
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
fact Mr Carlin has told me that I think
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
based on representative goalie's bill
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
which I
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
used as a way of drafting the amendment
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
that some of this analysis has already
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
been done so I I feel based there were a
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
number of options analyzed as we dealt
 
00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:37.460 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 436 and what house bill
 
00:35:40.849 --> 00:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
2. and some of that information is
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
available right now so we don't need to
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
repeat it right and the point I'm making
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
is that that consultant line should be
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
something that we can handle in our
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
budgets for these two
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay proposals more than that I think it
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
depends on you know how far we go what
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
retirement system it will cost obviously
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
a lot more than just changing this one
 
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.190 align:start position:0%
a lot more than just changing this one
page

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not going to thank America I'm
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
not opposed to uh extending it a little
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
bit but uh I I also question as to how
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
far we're gonna go uh I I understood
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
this uh commission to basically be re
 
00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:31.099 align:start position:0%
try and find a problem for the
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
1834 people and I don't have a problem
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in moving forward and looking
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
at some other stuff but uh you know I
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
think we have to be realistically
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
careful as to how far I've been uh we
 
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
want to go
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
but I I think our primary goal ought to
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
be is is finding a fix for this
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
particular issue okay Madam chair yes
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
maybe just for the ease of our work that
 
00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps the speaker and the president
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
could have some conversation before our
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
meeting next week and just figure out
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know what they what they think they
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know what range and what things
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
would be studied and uh that there will
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
because you're they're paying for it
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
so maybe that and then rather than us
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
deciding as a commission now what we
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
want looked at maybe there could be a
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
proposal they would bring in next week
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
that would cover the things they want to
 
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.770 align:start position:0%
that would cover the things they want to
cover

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
um I I that's fine I think they could
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
I think any major rewrite is going to
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
have to come in as a bill yeah a
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
separate bill I mean the commission
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
itself may offer May
 
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
sponsor a bill for this one issue and
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
probably will but
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
other people can
 
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.470 align:start position:0%
other people can
um

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there will be other bills I've
 
00:37:56.569 --> 00:37:56.579 align:start position:0%
heard from several people that there's a
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
couple more in work right now so we'll
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
be dealing with those I'm glad and we'll
 
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
get the analyzes on those as the bill
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
part of the commission
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you I I just want to point out I
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
mean I think group two is what prompted
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
the commission and the disagreement
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
between the house and the Senate on what
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
to include in the budget uh that's what
 
00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
prompted it but ultimately we are
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
looking at a larger scope uh I think the
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
charge of the commission as outlined in
 
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.109 align:start position:0%
charge of the commission as outlined in
hb2

00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
includes group one group two uh you know
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
colas uh you know the report of the uh
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
decennial retirement commission I mean
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's there's a fair number of items
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
on here and so
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think just for us to to look
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
at all of that and
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that we're
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
we're addressing yes group two but also
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
looking at uh the entire retirement
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
system as we work on on this
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
at least at a top level of what's what's
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
important and
 
00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
important and
um

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
and how to tell if it's a worthwhile
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
change that that's something that I
 
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:16.700 align:start position:0%
think we can brainstorm without
 
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily needing an Actuarial on
 
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.370 align:start position:0%
necessarily needing an Actuarial on
analysis

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
yes we do have more than this one one
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
issue even if it was the trigger
 
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.950 align:start position:0%
issue even if it was the trigger
okay

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
any comments on this
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
I guess so the one thing I would say was
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
inadvertent on my part on the disability
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
issue that Senator Susie raised so I
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:58.970 align:start position:0%
think that
um

00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
when we ask the retirement system to ask
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
GRS to look at that it that also should
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
be included as a separate line item in
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
the Actuarial analysis does that make
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
I just a question uh Madam chair would
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
you have any idea how long
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh or maybe if somebody can answer how
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
long it would take to get this
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
information that we're requesting
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
I know you work on this stuff all the
 
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.650 align:start position:0%
I know you work on this stuff all the
time

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
since they've done similar things I
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
would say
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks would be my guess
 
00:40:57.839 --> 00:40:59.930 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks would be my guess
um

00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll keep in touch and find out I
 
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would be months
 
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
is there um
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
any practical way that we could possibly
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
lay out uh an agenda for the uh
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
coming meetings
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh maybe no not the whole you know until
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
the end but maybe every couple weeks
 
00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.099 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so that the members might
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.450 align:start position:0%
be able to
um

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:28.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
look at what uh you know what we got
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
coming up and um you know maybe do any
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
analysis that they might have to do
 
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
analysis that they might have to do
um

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:38.710 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.210 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'll have to consult with the retirement
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
system on when they would expect to have
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
the first analyzes ready because I think
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
that would be the first detailed meeting
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
when we say
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
this this is our some of our choices and
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
they cost X Y and Z and how which ones
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
do we want
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
um but I'll try to get something out
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
before next week
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea
 
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:19.310 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea
[Music]

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
all right then we have two plans
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
of basic one change is the multiplier
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
one changes the
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
multiplier and changes the groups for
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
group two in the
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
tiered area and both would need
 
00:42:48.119 --> 00:42:51.950 align:start position:0%
tiered area and both would need
disability

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
so should we send those off for a
 
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:43:02.819 --> 00:43:05.510 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye opposed

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay we will send those two plans off
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
for an Actuarial analysis
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
basically high level and looking at what
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
other areas we should concentrate on and
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
what criteria we should use for
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
making changes
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:35.339 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have anything
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
if they want to bring up mention or ask
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
about Senator gray uh I believe that the
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
retirement system did do some
 
00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:43.990 align:start position:0%
retirement system did do some
calculations

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
calculations
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
on a increase in the multiplier you know
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
at uh 20 years of service and 30 years
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
of service and I think they already have
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it was an official
 
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
one or an off the Record one but if they
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
have those records that should also be
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.809 --> 00:44:13.819 align:start position:0%
was saying that he has some of the
 
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
analyzes that were done last year and I
 
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
believe that was one of them that he
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
will be able to present to the
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
commission commission next week when
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
he's back from vacation
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
he was still still collecting them when
 
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
when he left
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone else have anything
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
that they want to bring up concerns
 
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:38.750 align:start position:0%
that they want to bring up concerns
issues

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
well in that case we are adjourned and
