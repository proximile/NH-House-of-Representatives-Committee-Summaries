thank you Mr chair thank you members of
 
00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record Jeff

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
um it's a pleasure to meet with all of
 
00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate your time this morning
 
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the invitation from
 
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative long to be here uh my
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
understanding from speaking with him is
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
that this committee is interested in
 
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 align:start position:0%
learning about ways to address the
 
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
crisis of affordability that we have in
 
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
this state it's a laudable goal I
 
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
applaud that it's certainly something
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to do in Manchester
 
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
we're also working on dealing with
 
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 align:start position:0%
affordability of housing in our city and
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
so from speaking with representative
 
00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
long I thought I would try to walk you
 
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
through a little bit about what we're
 
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
doing to try to help you understand how
 
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
we're working at the local level and
 
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
hopefully that can be of use to you so
 
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
if it's all right with you I've got a
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
written statement I'll just read from
 
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
that to give you a summary of what we're
 
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
doing and then I'd be happy to take any
 
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have so the
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
board of Mayor and Alderman and other
 
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
city leaders in Manchester have made
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
housing affordability a top policy
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
priority my department among others is
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
tasked with trying to find solutions to
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
make housing more affordable
 
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
something that I always try to keep in
 
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
mind for myself and something that I
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
frequently talk to policy makers about
 
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
in Manchester is that housing is subject
 
00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start position:0%
to the same Market forces of supply and
 
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
demand as all goods and services in our
 
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
economy and with the demand for housing
 
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
in Manchester continuing to increase and
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
costs continuing to go up my advice to
 
00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 align:start position:0%
policy makers who want to bring down the
 
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
cost of housing is that we should be
 
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
doing what we can to add Supply we've
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
done that in Manchester in a number of
 
00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
different ways first we try to create a
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
favorable regulatory environment for the
 
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
construction of housing we allow for
 
00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 align:start position:0%
housing to be built densely both with
 
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
small lot requirements and by allowing
 
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
buildings to get fairly tall in some
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
areas we know that tall buildings aren't
 
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
for everyone though and so we try to
 
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
also find subtle ways to add to the
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
city's housing stock
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
for instance my department and the
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester planning board recently
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
worked together to propose a zoning
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that would allow accessory
 
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
dwelling units to be built more easily
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
additionally we hired a planning
 
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 align:start position:0%
consulting firm in 2019 to help us
 
00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 align:start position:0%
rethink all of our land use regulations
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
and one of the main goals of this effort
 
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
is to create regulations that can help
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
add housing Supply and bring down costs
 
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
so as part of that effort we adopted a
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
new master plan in 2021 which
 
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
incidentally one plan of the Year from
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire planners Association
 
00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 align:start position:0%
and we are working on writing an
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
entirely new zoning ordinance based on
 
00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 align:start position:0%
that plan
 
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
in addition to our written regulations
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
we also have a culture of being
 
00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 align:start position:0%
favorable to development in Manchester
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
the planning department recently
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
analyzed the decisions of our Zoning
 
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment from 2015 to 2021.
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
it was more than a thousand applications
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
and we found that the zoning board
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
granted complete approvals to 86 percent
 
00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 align:start position:0%
of the applications that came before
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
them and partial approvals to another
 
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
three percent of the application so
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's close to a 90 percent rate of
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
saying yes when people who want to
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
develop their properties in ways that
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't quite fit with our zoning
 
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
ordinance uh come before them these
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
decisions by the zba are practical
 
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that tell us on the planning
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
staff that we need to reevaluate our
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance and as I said we're
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
working on that now we intend for the
 
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
new ordinance to reduce the need for
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
applications to the zba in the first
 
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
place by allowing more development by
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
right but for now the zba is doing what
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
it can to allow people to develop their
 
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.650 align:start position:0%
it can to allow people to develop their
properties

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
properties
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
the benefit of Manchester's favorable
 
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment and practices is
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
that they allow us to respond to high
 
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
demand such as with the uh hot real
 
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
estate market that we're in right now in
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
the past three years our planning board
 
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
has approved around 1500 dwelling units
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
for construction in the city that's more
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
than double what we used to do during
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
similar time periods before the recent
 
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
spike in demand so to summarize this
 
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
first point creating favorable
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
regulations and having a favorable
 
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
culture is the first tool that we use to
 
00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 align:start position:0%
add housing Supply and respond to Market
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
needs the second strategy that we use in
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester to try to address housing is
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
that we do our best to create
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with developers and other
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
private sector businesses to incentivize
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
the construction of housing especially
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
housing that is Affordable to people of
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
lower incomes for instance mayor Craig
 
00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 align:start position:0%
created a housing task force that
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
included a range of private sector
 
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
representatives from our community that
 
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
task force issued a report in 2021 that
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
recommended the using city-owned land
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
for the construction of housing shortly
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
after the report came out the city
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
issued an RFP for the development of two
 
00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 align:start position:0%
parking lots owned by the city in the
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
downtown we offered to sell the Lots at
 
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
low prices in exchange for requiring
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
developments that included affordable
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
housing we got great responses to the
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
RFP and I and other staff members have
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
been working closely with the winning
 
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
developer for the past couple of years
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
we recently got approvals from the
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
planning board and the zoning board for
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
construction to begin on one of the Lots
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to bring about 360 Apartments
 
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:57.740 align:start position:0%
to what was an underutilized parking lot
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
60 of the apartments would have rent
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
capped at 80 percent of area median
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
income and another 50 units would be
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
capped at 60 percent of area median
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
income it's also going to bring about
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
650 parking spaces in two separate
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
parking garages and we expect
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
construction for this project to begin
 
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
this year and we are continuing to make
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
progress on the development of the other
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
lot as well
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
the third strategy that we use to add
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
housing is that we take advantage of
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
outside funding whenever we can
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester is a HUD entitlement
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
Community which means that we get
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds each year to serve our
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
low-income population we're usually able
 
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
to allocate about seven hundred thousand
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
dollars of those funds each year to
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
incentivize affordable housing we try to
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
use those funds to leverage other funds
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
as much as possible we work with
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
non-profit partners that are great at
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
assembling funds from a variety of
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
sources and we try to fill in gaps in
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
their funds so that we can help them
 
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
bring affordable housing to Manchester
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
to give you a few quick examples in the
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
past couple of years we've used federal
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
funds to help with the construction of a
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
48-unit low-income development by the
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester Housing and Redevelopment
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
Authority we've helped neighbor Works
 
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
renovate and construct 101 units of
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
low-income housing we've helped a group
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
called Helping Hands renovate a property
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
to construct 11 single-family uh sorry
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
single room occupancy units and we've
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
helped families in transition both
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
renovated temporary shelter and
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
construct 14 units of low-income housing
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
Additionally the recent influx of arpa
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
dollars has created a unique opportunity
 
00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
for us to incentivize affordable housing
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
even further we've used about 2.7
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
million dollars of arpa funds to help
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
with the construction of three buildings
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
from the same developer at one
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
intersection in Manchester these
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
buildings will house 192 Apartments all
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
of which will rent for 60 percent of
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
area median income or less
 
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
we also used about 1.1 million dollars
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
of pandemic relief funds to help
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
Waypoint renovate an old office building
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
that is now a youth homeless shelter and
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
three Apartments additionally we use
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars of Arbor
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
funds to assist the Manchester Housing
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
and Redevelopment authority to establish
 
00:09:59.449 --> 00:09:59.459 align:start position:0%
a landlord incentive program which pays
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
landlords to bring their properties up
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
to HUD standards so that they can accept
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
housing Choice vouchers
 
00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
these are just a few of the successes
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
but the point is that we try to work
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
with non-profit developers and service
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
providers to help them fill in the gaps
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
so that they can bring much needed
 
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
affordable housing to the city so to
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
recap we try to take advantage of
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
Regulation public-private Partnerships
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
and funding to help increase the supply
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
of housing in Manchester and bring
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
prices down
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
I recognize that I and my colleagues in
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
Manchester are working in a particular
 
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
context with a particular set of tools
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
that are available to municipalities and
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
may not translate entirely to the state
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
level of government so what I'd like to
 
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
do in conclusion is suggest that this
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee consider a fairly small
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
legislative change that may be able to
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
help bring down housing prices
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
as I said before increasing the supply
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
of housing means being able to build
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
more dwelling units per acre
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
problem is that it is really difficult
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
to get the kind of density that is
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
necessary to bring down prices when
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
housing is built without Municipal sewer
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
and water septic systems and Wells need
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of land per dwelling unit to work
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
so density needs Municipal Utilities as
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you know most municipalities in
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire don't have Municipal sewer
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
and water so their ability to increase
 
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
the supply of housing is limited my
 
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
suggestion then is that this committee
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
may want to consider a change to RSA
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
chapter 674 section 21 which is the
 
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
statute on Innovative land use controls
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
that statute allows municipalities to
 
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
charge impact fees to new developments
 
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
to help pay for infrastructure like
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
sewer and water systems
 
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.889 align:start position:0%
sewer and water systems
um

00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
the issue with how the statute is
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
written currently is that it only allows
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
municipalities to hold on to impact
 
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
views for six years if the fee isn't
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
spent within six years it needs to go
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
back to the property owner when you
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
think about the complexity of planning
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
and constructing a municipal sewer or
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
water system and you think about the
 
00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:53.459 align:start position:0%
tremendous expense of construction which
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
is usually bonded for something like 20
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
years you realize that six years is not
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
enough time to hold on to impact fees
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities cannot plan for a 20-year
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
Bond on just six years worth of
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
intermittent funds these funds only come
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
in when buildings are constructed so
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's impossible for municipalities to
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
plan for what's coming next
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
they need the money in the bank to
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
really plan and that money needs to stay
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the bank for a while uh so to close
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
this presentation on what I hope is a
 
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
helpful suggestion I would respectfully
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
suggest amending RSA 674 colon 21 to
 
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to hold impact fees
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
for longer than six years I think 10
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
years might be on the low end of what
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
you might want to consider and 20 years
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
to match up with typical bonding
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
duration might be better doing this
 
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
would certainly help Manchester keep up
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
with our needs to improve our
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and continue to provide
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
housing and my guess is that it would
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
help a lot of smaller municipalities
 
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
have a good chance of creating their own
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
Sewer and Water Systems which would
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
expand the possibilities of warehousing
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
can be built in the state and therefore
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
bring down housing costs and so with
 
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
that I'll conclude and I'd be happy to
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your
 
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
presentation and I I appreciate it in
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
the from the outset the Nuance of you
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
mentioning the crisis of affordability
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
we normally talk about housing crisis in
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
general but
 
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.769 align:start position:0%
general but
um

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:17.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
technically and this number may be just
 
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
a couple years old but uh you know we
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
have technically the number of rooms to
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
cover every every person in the state
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is they aren't affordable so
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of your solutions that you
 
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
proposed are um are helpful in concept
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
even if they you know not every
 
00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339 align:start position:0%
Community looks like Manchester I had a
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
question a specific question and I I
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your very specific
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation I think it's a good one
 
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
um when you said uh rent caps on 80
 
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
median income and sixty percent median
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
income do you mean
 
00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
those units were qualified for tenants
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
under that level or is that a price is
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
that like a percentage that is the rent
 
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:13.870 align:start position:0%
that like a percentage that is the rent
price

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
of so affordable for so 30 of 80 of the
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
median income is that what you mean okay
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I appreciate the
 
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:33.290 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I appreciate the
clarification

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
yes you you mentioned um uh
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
being open to finding outside funds
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and um I'll mention that um I'm
 
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.710 align:start position:0%
um and um I'll mention that um I'm
retired

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
retired
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
retired employee of the U.S Department
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
of Housing and Urban Development uh
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
where I worked for 29 years
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
um but I retired seven years ago so I
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
won't ask you about any specific
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
programs because the programs change I'm
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um you said you're an entitlement
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
Community which in fact I know because
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh I oversaw a lot of that work
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
um uh so you're getting Community
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
Development block grant funds uh which
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're putting towards housing which I'm
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
very glad to hear
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me what other HUD
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
programs you've applied for and what
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
uh you for the question specifically in
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
under our entitlement Community status
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
we get home funds cdbg funds and ESG
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
funds that's the kind of standard mix
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we get every year usually totals up
 
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
to about two and a half million dollars
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
um perhaps uh I know what home and ESG
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
funds are but perhaps everyone else
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
isn't quite as familiar so perhaps you
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
should tell them what that is sure home
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
funds are typically used for affordable
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
housing and that's when I listed that
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
700 000 number that's exclusively home
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
funds we also do use an additional we
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
get a hundred and sixty thousand dollars
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
approximately each year of ESG emergency
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant funds those are used
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
also in a housing related context most
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
of the time we'll use them for what's
 
00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
called tenant-based rental assistance we
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
will use them to to pay the rent for
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
people who cannot otherwise pay their
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
rents that's the standard mix that we
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
get every year on a yearly rotating
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
basis we also apply for other HUD funds
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
we recently got a healthy homes Grant of
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
about 2.2 million dollars and we also
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
got a lead abatement Grant so Manchester
 
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you're probably all aware
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
has a very old housing stock about
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of our housing stock was
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
constructed prior to 1979 and 1978 was
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
when the the federal government passed
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
the law that requires all that eliminate
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me prohibits the use of lead
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
paint in buildings so we have most of
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
our housing stock was built before that
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
and so lead paint is a serious issue in
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
Manchester and so we routinely apply for
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
and receive grant funding from HUD to uh
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh to provide incentives to Abate uh
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
lead paint in rental housing
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.110 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
um you in your opening you said
 
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.189 align:start position:0%
um you in your opening you said
um

00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
you were trying to make Adu acquisition
 
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
more easy in your um
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
in your zoning ordinance what specific
 
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
things are you trying to Target as far
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
as making that more easy sure and at
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
some point Mr chair I'd be happy to
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
invite our chair of a planning board up
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
as well he and I work closely together
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
on this whenever it's convenient to you
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
um but uh the planning department and
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
the planning board work together on
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
bringing a zoning Amendment to the board
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
of Mayor and Alderman uh for approval
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that's working its way through the
 
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
process now everything seems like it's
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
going favorably
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
um specifically that ordinance is
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
intended to allow accessory dwelling
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
units to be larger than they currently
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
are under our current ordinance allow
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
them to have lower setback requirements
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
so that they can be built in more places
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
on a lot have less parking requirements
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
right now it's one parking space per
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
bedroom and where the proposal is to
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
have just one parking space per Adu so
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
if it's a two bedroom it would still
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
require one parking space and maybe the
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
biggest thing is that it would no longer
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
require a conditional use permit for any
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit that's
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
constructed in an existing building we
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
still thought that planning board would
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
want to have some jurisdiction over the
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
new construction of a new building in a
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
neighborhood but if it's uh which most
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
of them are the construction of an
 
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit in an existing
 
00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:30.539 align:start position:0%
garage or basement or addition to a
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
house or something like that the
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
planning board and the planning
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
department felt that it wasn't really
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
worth making the applicant go through
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
the process when there's going to be no
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
okay pretty interesting
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
my question it's simple what is the
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
increase in size proposed to be sure it
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
is currently limited to 750 square feet
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
which is uh per statute that's kind of I
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
think the minimum maximum that can be
 
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.490 align:start position:0%
think the minimum maximum that can be
put

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
um and so we're increasing it to 900
 
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
square feet
sure

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you my colleagues are smiling at
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
me because I'm the prime sponsor of the
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
Adu bill which does much of what uh
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
you're talking about doing and we're
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
going to have my town planner come and
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
speak to us about edu's and what we're
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
doing in my town about that so I'm very
 
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
appreciative for all of that work
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
um I want to go back to regulation
 
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
because my experience of this committee
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
so far is that we seem to be more or
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
less on the same page when it comes to
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
ending a lot of exclusionary zoning
 
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
practices and stuff
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
um but we are less sure of where we are
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
as a committee on regulation
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
and when you talked about
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
um funds that your city gets one of the
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
things that I have seen in my town and
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
in other towns as well is and it's an
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunate term because it's confusing
 
00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
but rent-thinking Behavior by landlords
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
who see that these funds are available
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
to tenants that they're getting
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
assistance and then raise their rents in
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
order to specifically exploit those
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
federal or federal or any kind of funds
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
that are available to them
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
have you found any way to prevent that
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
or regulate that
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
um we have not although I will say I'm
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
probably not the best person to answer
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
that because we receive the funds
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
ourselves we work with non-profit
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
Partners like neighbor works like the
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
Manchester housing Redevelopment
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
Authority they're the ones who tend to
 
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
administer those that New Hampshire
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority also so we
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
hope to provide the funds we work with
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
them but we are not in the kind of
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
direct landlord tenant link the way that
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.130 align:start position:0%
they are
sure

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
 
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.330 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
um

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
when you are doing this kind of analysis
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
of the zba uh number of applicants how
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
how often they got approved did you also
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
um like targeting specific sections that
 
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
seem to always be getting
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
um requests for zba
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
um or or was it kind of flat across the
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
whole zoning ordinance if you know and
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
then kind of what you you also talked
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
about trying to get a target of of just
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
lower I guess General applications to
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
the zba do you have like a specific
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
Target or or
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
um just can you expound on that I guess
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
sure so we did look into that we and
 
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:33.299 align:start position:0%
when you say specific sections I think
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
you mean of the zoning ordinance like
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
parking versus setback versus height
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing yes we did do that I
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
don't have the kind of results of that
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
analysis here in front of me certainly
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
parking was one that came up a lot um
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know Manchester has a number of
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
small lots a number of lots that are
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
arranged such that the house is pretty
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
close to the street and so when you try
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
to fit cars in a driveway it can pretty
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
quickly create problems for zoning
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
requirements because parking spaces have
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
certain Dimensions that need to fit in
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
order to comply with zoning
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
um setbacks was another one height not
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
as much this is kind of from memory so I
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
apologize but nothing really he jumped
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
out as glaringly more than anything else
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
but there were certain things that you
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
would expect to rise to the top like
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
those that I mentioned and and they did
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
but nothing was really a glaring red
 
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
so I mean I also asked about the like
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
the goal to that you're trying to reduce
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
you said like 1500
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
um applications I don't know if that was
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
that was over the entire period 2015
 
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
through 20 21 right they had 1100 total
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
applications uh and so thank you I
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
apologize remember this question now so
 
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a Target
 
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
um what we expect is that um as the
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance catches up to kind of
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
what we can tell from the zoning board
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
and from other our experience is really
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
going on on the ground which is that the
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance isn't quite reflecting
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
reality in all cases you know uh the
 
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
zoning board frequently will grant
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
variances for setbacks for instance and
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
it that is a clear indication to us that
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
the setbacks are probably just too big
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
and probably need to be reduced and once
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
we go through that exercise create the
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
new zoning ordinance that reduces the
 
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
setbacks we would expect a significant
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
number of fewer uh setback variances
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
being applied for we don't have kind of
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
like an arbitrary number not that's
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
arbitrary we don't have a number that
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
we're really shooting for but we would
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
expect just by common sense that would
 
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
come down significantly
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
I can follow up again follow up
 
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.789 align:start position:0%
I can follow up again follow up
um

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:39.740 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that
 
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.330 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that
um

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.470 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
did you look at
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
um kind of
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at the zba kind of
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
variance opportunity
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
to to change the zoning did you look at
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.430 align:start position:0%
how many
um

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
things were or because of increased
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
zoning which made the existing
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure on the lot
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um illegal non-conforming yes
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
non-conforming um we didn't look at that
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
specifically our last zoning ordinance
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
before so the history of zoning in
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester is 1927 was the first one
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
then we have a new one in 1965 and then
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
the current one in 2001 and so we're
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
working on our fourth one now
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
um so it has been a long time between
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
1965 and 2001 and there are a number of
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
buildings in Manchester as you might
 
00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:39.539 align:start position:0%
imagine because it's such an old city
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
that we're non-conforming on day one in
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
1965 and we're non-conforming on day one
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
in 2001.
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
um those are kind of part of the fabric
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
now uh and so if anything we are kind of
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
looking at as I said loosening the
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
regulations and trying to kind of roll
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
some of the restrictions back that were
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
imposed in 2001. Manchester a lot of
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
what people love about Manchester is the
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
oldest parts of the city and that's true
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cities throughout the
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
country in the world and so we want to
 
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
make those things that people love about
 
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
the city
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
um be legal and not be you know made
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
made non-conforming but be made
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
conforming because we would make the
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
regulations respond to what the fabric
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the community actually is
 
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.029 align:start position:0%
of the community actually is
sure

00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:26.179 align:start position:0%
what good green
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
referral Kella and I are just going to
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
play a little game of badminton here uh
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
so when when you're talking about how 90
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the variance is more or less are
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
being approved anyway and so can we roll
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
back some of those things do you have a
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
sense of how many people
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
might not be even applying because they
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
would have to apply for a variance and
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
so if that those ordinances didn't exist
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
you would have that much more
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
development and that much more Supply
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
being built it's a great question we
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
don't track that but anecdotally I know
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
that that's happening I've spoken to a
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
number of design professionals surveyors
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
Engineers we actually did as part of our
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
zoning process we did formal interviews
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
with a number of design Professionals in
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
our community and they told us that they
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
have lost clients because they have said
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
to them you know uh hey you're going to
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
need a variance to do this thing you
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
want to do but don't worry the
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
Manchester zba is usually pretty
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
favorable to this sort of thing so it'll
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
be a month and a little bit of money but
 
00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
you know you'll get through it and the
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
clients say no thank you they say it
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
introduces risk and time into the
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
process that we as developers don't want
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
to deal with and we'll go somewhere else
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
so it's an unfortunate situation
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
whenever that happens because Manchester
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
loses out on the business or the housing
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
units that could have otherwise been
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
developed so that's certainly you know
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
the economic development side of this is
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
something that we take seriously and
 
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to take into account as we
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
write our zoning organs and not a
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
question but I imagine a lot of those
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
people also they've had experiences with
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
other communities that weren't as
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
accommodating as Manchester has been and
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
so they've just kind of learned if
 
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
here okay thank you thank you for taking
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
my question so what happens when there
 
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
is a subdivision and there are minimum
 
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:16.580 align:start position:0%
lot sizes how does that work into
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
possibly having an Adu in a subdivision
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
sure so um that's certainly something
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
that can be accommodated in most
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and Manchester has a range
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
of lot sizes it goes up to 40 000 square
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
feet on the high end which is by New
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire standards is actually still
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
not that big
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
um down to five thousand square feet for
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
a minimum which is quite Low by New
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire standards but even in a 5 000
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
square foot lot depending on the size of
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
the building an Adu can be accommodated
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
and as I said earlier you know adus can
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
go in basements too they can go on top
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
of garages they can be pretty subtly
 
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
nestled into even a small lot and they
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
can fit
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up but is there a
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
conflict with the covenants for the
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
subdivision like the subdivision says
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
you know you know uh
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
single family home minimum lot size two
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
acres blah blah blah how does that work
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
sure good question so um there are some
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
subdivisions where there will be deed
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are placed on it by
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
the developer we as the city of
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester don't regulate those so
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's a private Covenant in between
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
different landowners
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
um but um I don't I don't see I do
 
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
review a fair number of those I don't
 
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
see that as being a provision that I
 
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
frequently run into But ultimately it's
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
not a governmental issue so much as a
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:36.049 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
go ahead I want to follow up
 
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
to I just wanted to
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned one tool that you you
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
would uh like to see I was just
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
wondering if there was any other tools
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
that you may not be as as pinpointed but
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
just in the general scope of of
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh like you know I don't know Des needs
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
to update their you know rules or
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
something like that that could be more
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
vague but not as uh but still important
 
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
maybe I appreciate it I don't know that
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
I have anything fully formulated at this
 
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
point but I'll be happy to give it some
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
thought and get back to you yeah
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of time so thank you
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair and thank you again for
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
taking in another question so this may
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
be slightly out of the scope of your
 
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.210 align:start position:0%
be slightly out of the scope of your
your

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
um expertise because realizing
 
00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:30.419 align:start position:0%
Manchester is obviously more more urban
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
um when you talked about uh development
 
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
and adus in particular being dependent
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
on the Water and Sewer requirements are
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
existing Adu statute of course still
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
allows municipalities to require even
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
off the water and sewer to require
 
00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.710 align:start position:0%
off the water and sewer to require
appropriate

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
um water and sewer or water and uh and
 
00:29:48.659 --> 00:29:50.389 align:start position:0%
um water and sewer or water and uh and
septic

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
septic
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
but a lot of those lot minimums I have
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
the sense might be again it's outside
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester five acre lot minimums we saw
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
a presentation in some communities
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
there's over 20 acre minimums clearly
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
you don't need 20 acres for uh for a
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
septic so do you have a sense of in
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
general and I know it depends on soils
 
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
and everything what kinds of size of
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
land would be appropriate for that what
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
would be like a minimum requirement in
 
00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.049 align:start position:0%
would be like a minimum requirement in
general

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to dodge the question but
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
we we see uh septic systems so rarely in
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester so much of the city is on
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
Municipal sewer and water that it's and
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
as you say it is highly dependent on
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
soil types and a number of other things
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know that I should answer I
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
thought it might be outside your
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
expertise thank you well hold that
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
question we have an engineer coming in
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
on our next meeting so yeah I'm a very
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
well-known man in Manchester by the way
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
we have school vacation this week so a
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
couple people couldn't make it but he's
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.250 align:start position:0%
one of them
um

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
I know you anybody else boy I know that
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh Manchester uh Elm Street has got a
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of units uh planned now how far
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
did you go on loosening the parking
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
requirements for those
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
at least those two big projects on Elm
 
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
Street yep so
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
um when you see the two big projects you
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
mean the one opposite Market Basket yeah
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
one and then the one with the uh Pearl
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
Street yeah yep that one's just off
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester yeah so um both of those uh
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
buildings are in what we call the
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
central business district which in
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester has no parking requirements
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
you can build a 20-story building and
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
not put a parking space at all if you
 
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.669 align:start position:0%
not put a parking space at all if you
want

00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539 align:start position:0%
so would you think that would be a good
 
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
idea for most cities to
 
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.769 align:start position:0%
idea for most cities to
if

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's so dependent on on the municipality
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
itself you know I mean that's that's a
 
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
CBD thing for us it's in a certain
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
District the rest of the city does have
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
parking minimums and we're looking at
 
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
those and how we can update them
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
um but you know it wouldn't be anything
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
that I would recommend you know at the
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
state level certainly that's that's
 
00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:58.830 align:start position:0%
Community by Community you know okay
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.450 align:start position:0%
Community by Community you know okay
[Music]

00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.970 align:start position:0%
[Music]

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%

and I'm uh representative Pat long uh
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
District 23 in Manchester and I also
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
serve on the board
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
I bet since 2006 uh other than two terms
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I have some testimony I also
 
00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
have copies that I can hand out
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
afterwards but some of it was covered by
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
director Belanger so um he covered a lot
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
of things pretty thoroughly so I'll just
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
go through this and note when some other
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
things are redundant but I wanted to
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
First speak about some of the things
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we have done recently from a
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
planning board perspective to help
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
address the housing crisis in our
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
community and then get to some of the
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
areas where we could use your help I
 
00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:52.019 align:start position:0%
tried to come up with some of some ideas
 
00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:52.909 align:start position:0%
tried to come up with some of some ideas
of

00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
where some State action could be useful
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
for us so uh first of all we what have
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
we done on the planning board so in 2022
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
alone just last year we approved more
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
than a thousand units through the
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
planning board not everything in the
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
city that gets built has to go through
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
the planning board um but for what did
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
um to us we approved a substantial
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
portion of that and in my now into my
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge we haven't approved that many
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
housing units in recent memory
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
um and this year alone we're not halfway
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
through but we approved 427 units thus
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
far so we're doing our best to say
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
um yes and to development you know maybe
 
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
we need to have have some changes to the
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
application that's where the and comes
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
in but we try not to say no right off
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
the bat uh so it comes down to kind of
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
that culture director Belanger was
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
talking about we also uh the board has
 
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
tried to take a more active role in
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
shaping some of our regulations and
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
long-term planning for the city
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
um in the past
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
from my personal perspective I felt like
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
the planning board was being very
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
reactive and just handling the
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
applications that are sent before us but
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
in recent years we've really been trying
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
to say okay this is where the city's at
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
and this is where we need to be what can
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
we do to actually make a difference uh
 
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
from a more infrastructural standpoint
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
talking about regulations and all of
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
that so the Adu stuff that director
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
Belanger was talking about was very
 
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.710 align:start position:0%
Belanger was talking about was very
important

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
um the vice chair on the planning board
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
took a really important role in
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
spearheading that one thing that um was
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
not mentioned is I believe the new
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
updates that are still being considered
 
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
by the board of Mayor and Alderman those
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
updates include allowing detached units
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
in the city
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that beforehand
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
they were not allowed maybe they could
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
have gotten a zoning variance but this
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
but but it should be a lot easier now to
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
build detached and then attached uh or
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
or like internal is more bite right now
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
so another thing is we tried to reduce
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
School impact fees for certain types of
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
developments that the data showed don't
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
post many school-aged children so for
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
example housing units less than 900
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
square uh square feet or having fewer
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
than two bedrooms those don't usually
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of children yet we were
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
charging them a substantial amount of
 
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
money per unit which then when you have
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
a larger building that can be a lot of
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
funding that the developer would have to
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
come up with so
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
that was another one of the things
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
um I want to just briefly remark on two
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
other initiatives so one is that we're
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
updating or working to update that is
 
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
our City's bicycle master plan not every
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
Community has one but Manchester
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
developed one in 2016 and its goal is to
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
really help facilitate that other mode
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
of transportation and that actually does
 
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
relate to housing because there's
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
something that is an important indicator
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
for how affordable a city is and that's
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
the housing and transportation
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
affordability indicator housing plus
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs because if you you
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
know have to pay a 30-year income for
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
housing well a lot of people in a lot of
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
communities also need to have a car
 
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
which then can cost a substantial amount
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
as well for the payments the insurance
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
the gas so if we can allow some people
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the more dense central parts of our
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
city to get around safely and
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
efficiently with a bicycle if they don't
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
want to or can't afford a car that can
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
really substantially lower their total
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
housing and transportation cost burden
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
it also can make it less important for
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
us to ask developers to include parking
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
with their developments which we can
 
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
look at different types of parking
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's surface or structured but
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
structured parking can often cost around
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars per space
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
which when you then try to recoup the
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
cost through rent that can add a
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
significant amount and make it more
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to build affordability into
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
the development so the last thing about
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
what the planning board has been trying
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
to do is that we're trying to ensure
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we have a broad set of perspectives
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
represented on the board so there are a
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
few members who are in their 20s and 30s
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to bring that
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
generational diversity of perspective
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
some folks who are renters currently and
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to bring more racial
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
and ethnic diversity to the board
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
because Manchester is one of the more
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
diverse communities in the city so we
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be run just by you know A
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
specific group of people with a specific
 
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.310 align:start position:0%
specific group of people with a specific
background

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
um because we'll often miss things and I
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
know that I as a man has missed you know
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
I don't have any children I don't plan
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
to have any uh in the near future but
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
one of the members on our board is a
 
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
young mother and she has brought up
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
issues about access for things like
 
00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:26.579 align:start position:0%
strollers and opportunity for kids to
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
potentially have a playground in an
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
apartment building and that is something
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
that I had neglected to think about
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
until we had her perspective so that's
 
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
part of why I think that's important and
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
something for other boards to consider
 
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
um so some of the things where the state
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
could potentially step in to help a bit
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things I want to talk about
 
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:47.540 align:start position:0%
just one aspect of direct assistance is
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
potentially allocating some more funding
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
for specific
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
development of housing for example the
 
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
invest New Hampshire grants that had
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
come out those were in my view pretty
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
helpful and then the city of Manchester
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
has taken the initiative to issue some
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
rfps itself if the state provided some
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
amount of funding it could make it a lot
 
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
easier for cities to say sure we'll
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
issue an RFP of our own and then we
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
could lock in some of that affordability
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
for some of the units but also get that
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
supply that we're really looking for
 
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
part of why I think it's important is
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
that you know new market rate housing is
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
really important for New Hampshire it's
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
an essential piece of the puzzle it
 
00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
helps with our housing Supply helps you
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
know get some of that with minimal
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
government expenditure because private
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
developers are doing it it enables
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
filtering and then it also increases
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
competition in the marketplace but we
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
have to remember that the entirety of
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
the housing that we need is sort of on a
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
sliding scale from extremely luxurious
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
on one end to extremely affordable on
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
another end and at a certain point you
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
know there will be a point in the Middle
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
where a for-profit developer isn't
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to find the profit
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
that they're looking for to make it
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
worthwhile so it's great that they can
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
focus on the higher end developments
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
perfect for them and it's their right
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
and it does help the community in
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
general but it does leave certain
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
segments of our community in a bind
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
where folks
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
who oftentimes are really helping our
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
communities get going lower income
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
workers they can't afford some of the
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
newer development so that's where City
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
and state-led affordable funding
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
initiatives can help fill that Gap where
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
the market chooses not to so it's kind
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
of two parts one is allowing the market
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
to do more the other is okay well where
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
where are they kind of not focusing on
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
and what can we do on that front
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
um in terms of indirect assistance
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
director Belanger mentioned sewer and
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
water infrastructure I would
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
additionally encourage you to look at
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
potentially providing some sort of
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
incentive or funding from the state
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
level for communities to take advantage
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
of I think we could reflect on the
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
experience of hb44 where a lot of the
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
opposition did come down to folks
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
feeling uncomfortable with the sewer and
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
water infrastructure that might be
 
00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579 align:start position:0%
necessary you know they weren't sure who
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
would pay for it how would it get built
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
where would the money come from
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
in Manchester we do have impact fees
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we could levy on some stuff I'm not
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure we've adopted sewer impact fees
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
specifically I know that developers
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
often help update some of the
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure around them when they are
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
doing a development there are also user
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
fees so people who are putting you know
 
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
taking water in putting sore out they
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
they have to pay but
 
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
um in any case the state legislature
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
could step in either with education for
 
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
communities to help them see hey you can
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
pay for it by doing this or by removing
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
that concern entirely by saying hey
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
here's a pot of money and obviously
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
money isn't always the solution to all
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
the problems but if some folks are
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
worried that they can't afford to build
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
more housing because they can't afford
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
the sewer well that's one way to look at
 
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
the sewer well that's one way to look at
it

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
um certain things that another thing
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
that could also be done is uh
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
prohibiting discrimination based on
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
housing Choice voucher status this
 
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't directly increase the amount of
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
Supply available but I think it's
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
important because the state government
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
does recognize that there is an
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
importance for people with housing
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
Choice vouchers to get housing like they
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that they desperately need it
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it necessarily on
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
their own but they are doing their best
 
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
to access the limited Supply we already
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
have and so I think if you know a
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
voucher holder finds a place that works
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
for them if they are otherwise qualified
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
then it actively works against New
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's interest if a private
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
landlord discriminates against a family
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
just because of some misconceptions
 
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
about what a voucher holder is like or
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
what they would need in terms of
 
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.470 align:start position:0%
what they would need in terms of
regulatory

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
um like inspections and stuff like that
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
so we definitely we definitely need more
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
housing Supply but we really need to
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
stop sabotaging the folks who are trying
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
their best and have gone through the
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
process but then somehow get turned away
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
because there isn't you know because the
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
landlord can do that
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
so that's just a few examples of the
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
ways the the state could help and I'm
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
sure there are more Alderman long I love
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
her if he could share his insight as an
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
Alderman and also a member of the
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
planning board but that's what I wanted
 
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
to share off the bat so thank you for
 
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:20.210 align:start position:0%
to share off the bat so thank you for
listening

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
um so uh a bigger point I have but I
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
have a quick easy question and that is
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
you talked about bicycle plan
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
um which is great I'm just wondering and
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
I know kind of bicycle would be like the
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
low hanging fruit there but like has
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
that expanded into conversations about
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
walkability and I know you have
 
00:43:40.609 --> 00:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
Manchester has some public
 
00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
transportation but like making all of
 
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
that more robust yeah that's a great
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
question and that is in my opinion
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely where we should be
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
going I'm not privy to all the
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
conversations that are happening I know
 
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.450 align:start position:0%
conversations that are happening I know
that

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
um there are some parts of the city
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
where there have been conversations to
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
expand bicycle access build out a bike
 
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
expand bicycle access build out a bike
lane

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
lane
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
um by removing some of the street
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
parking or making travel go in One
 
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
Direction so you don't need as many you
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
know you don't need two lanes in each
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
Direction Just One leave One Direction
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
and I think there's been conversation
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
with the MTA Manchester transit
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
authority to make it a bus bike lane
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
that way they could run Transit down
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
that um Corridor as well so there are
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
discussions of that I know the um
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
Department not New Hampshire but the U.S
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation just
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
released a new funding opportunity for I
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
think they call it safe streets for all
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
SS 4A and it's meant to be a
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensively enable municipalities to
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
take a comprehensive look at all of
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
those modes of transportation
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
walkability biking bus transportation or
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
whatever they have in addition to cars
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if Manchester is
 
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
planning to pursue that I would
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
encourage folks to uh in any Community
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
here to look at that but
 
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
um it's definitely part of the
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
conversation I don't think we have
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
any specific initiative on the planning
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
board to look at it holistically but I
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
would certainly welcome that opportunity
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we have to just
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
focus on bikes it's a big picture thing
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
um just uh for clarification
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you said you weren't sure
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
um whether Manchester had an impact fees
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
specifically directed to Water and Sewer
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
but I thought and maybe I misunderstood
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
but what I I thought what Mr Belanger
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
said was that Manchester does have
 
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
impact fees uh relating to Water and
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
Sewer but that you are concerned that
 
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
the city couldn't hold on to them long
 
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
enough uh because of the state statute
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
yep yeah I'll let uh director Belanger
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative we do not
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
currently have impact views for sewer
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
and water I am in discussions with our
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works about whether
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be necessary given the
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
amount of development that we have
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike we want to make
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we're keeping up with the
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
infrastructure end of things as we
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
increase housing and business space in
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
the city
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
um my point was more just at a state
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
level it may be helpful for all
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities especially those that are
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
kind of getting close to the point where
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
they might want some Municipal sewer and
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
water but aren't there yet that um
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
allowing them to hang on to their impact
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
views for longer than six years would
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
help them plan that out and make a
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
better attempt at actually implementing
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
it so you don't have them but um
 
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
if you did have them uh or if another
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
municipality had them
 
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:36.890 align:start position:0%
municipality had them
um

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
it would be better if they could hold on
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
to them hold on to the money for longer
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
than six years yes I mean you can leave
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
the statute allows for any municipality
 
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
to use impact fees for sewer and water
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
so at any time
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
municipality has the authority to do it
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's just the amount of time that they
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
have to hang on to the fees is short
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
right now thank you thank you yeah thank
 
00:46:59.930 --> 00:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
you director Blanchard and also uh we do
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
have fire and uh fire and school impact
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
fees currently so businesses and and uh
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
residential dwellings get charged a fire
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
impact fee um it's different for
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
commercial versus residential and the
 
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
residential units get charged for school
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
impact fee um but other than that we
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh yes I asked because
 
00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:27.589 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh yes I asked because
um uh

00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
as as I expect to know
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
um uh House Bill 44 which was an infill
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
development Bill failed and it seemed
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the reason that it failed
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
was that people were concerned about
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
um uh whether there was enough uh
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
capacity in Municipal Water and Sewer
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
um uh infrastructure
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
in order to support four units where
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
there had been one before if if this
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
became common which the law uh under
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
house bill 44 would have allowed it to
 
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.089 align:start position:0%
house bill 44 would have allowed it to
do

00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know that that is a
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
very important question
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and possibly more of an issue than
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
um say School impact fees because as as
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
you've pointed out uh not every
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
um not every unit will be occupied by a
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
family with children
 
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
um but every unit will use the water and
 
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:30.020 align:start position:0%
sewer system and the more units you have
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh the more pressure that puts on the
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
water and sewer system so that's
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
something you would always have to
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
consider I I would think yeah yeah
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
you're right on that and I think that's
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
something that this committee would need
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
to take in my taken under consideration
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
think about is there are different
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
routes he could take ranging from the
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
status quo to something more you know
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
significant but what do you want
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
communities to have to think about when
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about adding new
 
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.130 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about adding new
housing

00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
it could be that you want to make it
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
clearer through education on what their
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
options are it could be that you want to
 
00:49:08.089 --> 00:49:08.099 align:start position:0%
remove any possible concern entirely by
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
enabling communities to tap into some
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
sort of sewer and water funding it could
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
be something that I can't even think of
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
right now but I think that's part of
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
what this committee would need to
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
determine is we know we know where the
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
pressure points are but what are the
 
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
best ways to unlock the state's
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
potential for Housing Development
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
because we clearly haven't done enough
 
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.569 align:start position:0%
because we clearly haven't done enough
yet

00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to see about you mentioned bikes
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
I was interested in if you're have any
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
special regulation or differences in
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
your zoning or inner planning or thought
 
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.170 align:start position:0%
your zoning or inner planning or thought
um

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:05.579 align:start position:0%
um directed towards
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
if if electric bikes one Wheels scooters
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
are going to be would be considered in
 
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
that also as far as like allowed in the
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
bike Lanes or are they going to be more
 
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
pushed in into the streets kind of a
 
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:23.180 align:start position:0%
thing as those electric type of
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
powered Things become more popular if
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
they are something that you guys are
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
going to be trying to filter into the
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
bike lane or outside
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I know that
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
bench and that has not always been
 
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
successful because we don't always have
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
roads that accommodate safe bike travel
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
so people will you know even if they
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
know you're not supposed to be on the
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
sidewalk if they feel if it's a choice
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
of being squished by a car versus riding
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
on a sidewalk they'll do that in terms
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
of what types of devices are allowed in
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
the bike Lanes I would have to defer um
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
to a member of City staff I don't know
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
if director blander knows the answer but
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we actually have any
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
specific recommendations on that yet
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's really more of an issue that the
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works handles
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
rather than the planning department I
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if there's any kind
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
of additional lowered speed limit for
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
bike lanes that could be something that
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
that electric bikes could exceed but
 
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
that's really not mine thank you I've
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
seen some municipalities have have
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions of like even even like
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
walking a stroller across the street
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
would be not allowed in some
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities so it's very that they
 
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
can go outside of what I might see is
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate but
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
um what about uh min minimum like house
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
size have you seen like tiny home like
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
have you been able to
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
I guess there's now uh um zoning or not
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
a zoning but uh like a building code for
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
tiny homes and stuff like that do you
 
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.030 align:start position:0%
tiny homes and stuff like that do you
have

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
um minimum like house size requirements
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
in your zoning
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
um and what are if anything are you
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
trying to do to encourage those other
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
types of innovative kind of houses so
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
there was a fairly recent State
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the building code that kind
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
of made tiny homes just a little more
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
easy to build I mean things like you
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
know tiny homes can sometimes have Loft
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
space for beds things like that and the
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
building code as it was wasn't
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
particularly friendly toward that as a
 
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
general rule in Manchester there's no
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
minimum house size I mean you know a
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
tiny home can sometimes be something
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's on a on like a trailer or
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
something that's a different story but
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
as far as you know in New Hampshire you
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
need cross protection you need a
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
foundation right so
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
um as long as the house is built on a
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
foundation and meets kind of general you
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
know safety regulations for the building
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:44.569 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.579 --> 00:52:45.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative yokella may be interested
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
to know I've done a little bit of
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
research as part of a national caucus of
 
00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.220 align:start position:0%
environmental legislators on the
 
00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:53.930 align:start position:0%
environmental legislators on the
different

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:54.770 align:start position:0%
different
um

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
categories of electric bicycle and it's
 
00:52:59.809 --> 00:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
actually kind of become uniform across
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
the country anyway uh so this was a
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
question I was thinking of when the
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
director was speaking and then we kind
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
of went there again and I maybe more
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
formulated it the idea of water and
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
sewer impact fees in particular
 
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
forgive my ignorance but is there what
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
is the mechanism that enforces that to
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
be dedicated or is that something that a
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
municipality because if we're going to
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
like enshrine that for 20 years I think
 
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:31.140 align:start position:0%
what we would want to see in exchange is
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
to make sure that is going to water and
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
sewer and not like something that just
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
ends up in the general fund of the
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
municipality yeah absolutely um that and
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
I'll take that if that's okay yeah so
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
um the statute is written such that all
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
funds that come in for a particular
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
purpose have to be segregated for that
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
purpose and they are held in separate
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
accounts by the municipal finance
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
department to stay for that purpose so
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
the way that impacts these work just
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
generally is there will be a schedule in
 
00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
the zoning ordinance and that schedule
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
will say based on square footage or
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
based on number of dwelling units how
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
much money needs to come in you know per
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
whatever the unit is and that has to be
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
segregated as I said for six years and
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
then if it's not spent it's returned
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
back to the person who paid it
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
um so it they so in Manchester we have
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
school impact fees we have fire impact
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
fees those are always segregated you
 
00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:20.540 align:start position:0%
know there's no commandling of the funds
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
and they're kept for that purpose okay
 
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.950 align:start position:0%
and they're kept for that purpose okay
sure

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.089 align:start position:0%
sure
okay

00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you that's
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
actually a well maybe it's a question
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about the probable
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
correlation between
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
the bypass the greater walkability
 
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.309 align:start position:0%
the bypass the greater walkability
Etc

00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
and retaining our younger populations
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
here or having those folks come back
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
after college or whatever they left for
 
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
I think that would be helpful in growing
 
00:54:56.089 --> 00:54:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know if you have any
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
specific data or if you all no longer
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
have seen that but I know several
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
different Studies have come out one of
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
them is by the statework play
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
organization and looking at what younger
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
folks are looking for
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
um and something that you know both
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
anecdotally as a younger person and with
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
some younger friends and also looking at
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
this data
 
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
um that really is something that the
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
younger Generations would like in
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
general is can I walk around my
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
community can I exist in these third
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
spaces in the community where I can just
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
be with my friends or even alone just
 
00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
sitting enjoying a coffee or something
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
where I don't have to pay to exist you
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
know we have plenty of stores
 
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
restaurants where you can be there for a
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
time if you're a paying customer but
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
where can I just
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
actually exist that outdoor living room
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
so to speak that some of the the best
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
studies in the world have but maybe we
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
don't have enough of and some of the
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
folks who have that Mobility
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to move around
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
because they have you know that
 
00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.069 align:start position:0%
because they have you know that
professional

00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
um background or that education maybe
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're already out of the state and are
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
thinking to come back well what are they
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
going to look for and I think you're
 
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
right about some of some of that
 
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
equation for them is going to be
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
walkability bikeability or at least a
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
broader Choice range of choices and so
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
they aren't just pigeonholed
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
and I do want to pause here if I could
 
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
let uh Alderman long speak I don't know
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
if you had planned remarks but just
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
allow you to share some of your
 
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.849 align:start position:0%
allow you to share some of your
perspective

00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
I was uh I was just going to fall off I
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
mean both both of them did a great job
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
in articulating
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
what Manchester is currently doing uh we
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
pretty much take our lead from our
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
department heads
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I just uh with respect to the bike
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
Lanes there are no regulations uh the
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
issue we had when we first implemented
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and were people in wheelchairs were
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
driving down Pike Lanes lanes and we
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
ought to let them know this is not for
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
you this is very dangerous you stick
 
00:56:59.890 --> 00:56:59.900 align:start position:0%
with the sidewalk so that that went well
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh also the walkability the city of
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester was built walkable nuts
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
how was built all the Mills people walk
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
to the Mills so it'd be easier it seems
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
like it'd be easier to go back to
 
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
walkability but
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
conveniences with vehicles is is the
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
issue getting that you know having the
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
young people in downtown
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
um it's dangerous they're on their cell
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
phones there's there's bumper-to-bumper
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
traffic now that we've seen in the last
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
six seven years uh on the Main Street uh
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
consideration of shutting some of those
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
streets down
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
um is is considering that however the
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
businesses have an issue with no parking
 
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
um the two three spots they have in
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
front of their business they want that
 
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
for people apart in front of their
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
business so that's you know that that's
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
going to take a while uh to come down
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
um then the other thing was the
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
I remember in 2006 I was getting calls
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
from Bedford Auburn Hooksett looking for
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
people that needed Apartments
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't live in Auburn Bedford and
 
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
looks at I had relations there and I
 
00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
would say yeah absolutely yeah I got a
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
place I could get them affordable
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
um you know now that
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
impossible for me even for people in
 
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
Manchester I used to have some companies
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
I would go to and they'd slide somebody
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
in that's the last couple years that's
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
been impossible
 
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
um they don't they just don't have the
 
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
places and also on affordable housing uh
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
what amazes me is that the minutes of is
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
that the developers from out of state
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
that know the paperwork
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire doesn't have
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
that other than your uh Manchester
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
Housing and Redevelopment authorities
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
they do the Section 8 Elder and disabled
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and you have neighborworks however
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's a little more expensive for them
 
00:58:59.809 --> 00:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
because they don't manage their own
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
buildings these other developers that
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
are coming in the one we have with
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
woodio police station is in the law
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
office it's 100 affordable and it's uh
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
60 and under
 
00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
um and and they're going to manage it
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
you know they they don't have that added
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
cost we also have a company out of
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
California that's looking to buy a hotel
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
and they have their own non-profits that
 
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
service those hotels uh with respect to
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use so
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
there's a hotel they're looking at now
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
96 units uh to immediately get people
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
with those you know you know some of the
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
mental health people I talked to they
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
will never on their own be able to uh
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
take a step forward you know they're
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to constantly need
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
somebody visiting them on a regular
 
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
regular basis so so that's also being um
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
um you know that's also being looked at
 
01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.450 align:start position:0%
um you know that's also being looked at
uh

01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
I mean I've spoken to developers uh they
 
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
came into us a major developer in the
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester uh probably about
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
eight years ago and I asked them what
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
what is it what's a unit cost and what
 
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:19.740 align:start position:0%
is it that you need to make it
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
affordable uh and at that time it was
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
a cutting planning uh cutting zoning
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
we're just not going to come up with
 
01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.049 align:start position:0%
we're just not going to come up with
100.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
100.
 
01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:37.460 align:start position:0%
public money
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
to make that work and today I suspect
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's 250 to 280 are you
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so a couple of ideas uh one of them
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
was my 79 email they got shot down and
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
you know I get that
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
um but it but I on a planning board
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
there was a business owner who came to
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
the planning board wanted to burn
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
building one of the
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
build a new four-story
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
she built a four-story she was a
 
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.210 align:start position:0%
she built a four-story she was a
restaurant

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
owners and they they were for her
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
workers to live there
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh and and once that was built it was a
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
cultural here a barber shop that opened
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
up next door in a cultural uh clothing
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
store and I thought
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
you know so here's the inner city
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
that we're spur and economic development
 
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
would would having you know would having
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
decent uh decent housing there uh so I
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
thought 79e going to anybody you know
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's a small uh something that
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
we could give somebody uh to because I
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
know that was very difficult for her to
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
get her financing she needed a couple
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
other investors uh
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
is highly
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
um so so that was that was one uh also
 
01:02:06.049 --> 01:02:06.059 align:start position:0%
uh Manchester's doing density
 
01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
people don't get refused
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
with the density is there some way that
 
01:02:15.609 --> 01:02:15.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
included in Arizona
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
with density for example
 
01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
I you got 100 units you could put in
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
here you want 200. okay for that hundred
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
um for that hundred can we
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
can we get 20 affordable housing units
 
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
the developer could say no or they I
 
01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
mean I spoke with what actually Brady
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
Sullivan Lodge developer and he said I I
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
don't do that paperwork it says well
 
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
you got triple the density in this one
 
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
you got triple the density in this one
building

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
I don't think 10 or 15 affordable
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
housing is going to break you
 
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to do the paperwork
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
you just commit to whatever 5 10 15 20
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
years that this apartment unit will be
 
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
affordable at thousand dollars a month
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
um for whatever whatever the time frame
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
is and if you if you can't
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
um you know and if you don't want to do
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
it at all uh then it's twenty five
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars per unit that we were
 
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to make affordable into
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
our Housing Trust Fund so that you know
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
the idea is keeping
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
our Housing Trust funding building up
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
you know two million dollars a year just
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't cut
 
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
uh to a people and and given us
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
affordable housing so how do we how do
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
we keep that building
 
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.789 align:start position:0%
we keep that building
um

01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
I mean at the planning board level we
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
we even noted uh from the planning staff
 
01:03:46.319 --> 01:03:49.569 align:start position:0%
we even noted uh from the planning staff
that

01:03:49.569 --> 01:03:49.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
subdivision development and it was a
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation if we moved things around
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit they would be able to in
 
01:03:59.930 --> 01:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
Adu because right now in Manchester
 
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
we're looking at tight spaces they're
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
cram and in these units
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
it's okay with me you know as long as
 
01:04:06.299 --> 01:04:07.730 align:start position:0%
it's okay with me you know as long as
there's

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
they're the market people if they
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
believe it's going to sell who am I to
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
tell them no make give them a little
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
more room you know this is your you know
 
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
and with respect to the parking downtown
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement uh and it amazed
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
me in the last six or seven years that
 
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.069 align:start position:0%
me in the last six or seven years that
uh

01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
young people don't even want to have
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
cars they want to bike they want to walk
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
to wherever the work is they want to
 
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
walk for entertainment
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
um so so that's that's an attraction uh
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
is to be somewhere as where I could go
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
to a baseball game go to the Palace
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
Theater go to you know go to restaurants
 
01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
go to you know boards and Brews or
 
01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:51.970 align:start position:0%
go to you know boards and Brews or
whatever

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:51.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so so so
 
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
having them you know having these added
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
small things with which the
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities could offer a developer
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
uh to to
 
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
you know bring bring a uh bring a
 
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
housing plan to fruition would would be
 
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.950 align:start position:0%
housing plan to fruition would would be
very

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
and and rents are just I mean we just
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
opened uh
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
it was a
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
ribbon cutting on Elm Street that was a
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
96th unit
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
96 units and you know they're looking
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
for twenty seven to three thousand a
 
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.970 align:start position:0%
for twenty seven to three thousand a
month

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
in my head I'm thinking please don't
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
happen this I'm screwed big time if that
 
01:05:40.329 --> 01:05:40.339 align:start position:0%
happens uh trying to hit people housing
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
but it may it that may be the market
 
01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
sold so and you know you don't blame the
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
landlord I
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
it's a business
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
it's a business it's an investment
 
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know get your Market but you know I
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
get the calls from the elders have been
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
living somewhere for 30 years I gotta
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
leave uh I got to leave June 1st
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
there it's 900 a month going to 18. I
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
can't afford that uh so they're asking
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
me to leave
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
you know I used to be able to find them
 
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.170 align:start position:0%
you know I used to be able to find them
places

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
places
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
however fortunately for the adus I have
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
been it's a couple of towns
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
I call I talked to their children and I
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
asked them if you know can you set up an
 
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
Adu for you know your 88 year old mother
 
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
um and it surprises me today that a lot
 
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
of people don't realize that statutorily
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
you have to you have to allow adus
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
you're just going to follow their
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
principles because because the two
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
different towns at their parent that the
 
01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
children told me oh they're never going
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
to give me an inline
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
I've already tried that
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
then you know then I explained to them
 
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:51.059 align:start position:0%
it's it's required you just got to
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
follow their rules they were tickled
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
pink I wanted to do this for my mother
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
six years ago well you know so so the
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
words not completely out there that
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
adus are
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:07.609 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's it for me you too and you follow
 
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
um this question actually may go back to
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
director Belanger I'm not sure
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
um uh it was brought to my mind by the
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
uh reference to uh older people
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
um having to move out of Apartments
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
where the rent is is increasing
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
drastically and
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
again goes back to HUD programs and this
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh the programs that I'm thinking of
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
um are generally uh we're a non-profit
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
organizations rather than cities uh
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
apply for the assistance
 
01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:50.690 align:start position:0%
apply for the assistance
um but

01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
um and I I I didn't ask about this
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
before because there were substantial
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
changes to these programs just about the
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
time I retired uh so I'm absolutely not
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
sure what exists now but there were HUD
 
01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
programs that provided
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
um substantial assistance for building
 
01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
housing for older people and or people
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
um and again those are generally uh
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations that that apply
 
01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
to those programs has a city of
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester have been able to work with
 
01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.289 align:start position:0%
Manchester have been able to work with
any

01:08:23.289 --> 01:08:23.299 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations uh to apply for
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
such programs as currently exists
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
I can't think of a project that we've
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
done that has been targeted specifically
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
toward you know Elder residents that's
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
typically as I said we use home funds we
 
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
use ESG for housing those don't have a
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
Target we haven't received that and it
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
could just be because our non-profit
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
partners are doing that entirely on
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:54.299 align:start position:0%
um that certainly could be it just
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm suggesting that that
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
would be something to look into the
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
programs were called
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
um for older people it was the section
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
202 program and for people with
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities in section 811 program
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
again there were substantial changes
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
just about the time I retired so
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I could I have it in my head
 
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
what it was before I retired but uh
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have it in my head
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
what what it is today
 
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
um but this was something there was a
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
lot of activity in New Hampshire under
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
under both of those programs
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
um so that would be something to look
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
into in terms of uh what's available
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
today and particularly if um people are
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
being pushed out of apartments that they
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
can no longer afford we'll certainly
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
look into that thank you so just so on
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
the same on the same question uh we were
 
01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299 align:start position:0%
able with uh I believe it was home funds
 
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
or ESG with respect to mhra 48 units
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so so we get minimals we were
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
able to capitalize on that and get 48
 
01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.050 align:start position:0%
able to capitalize on that and get 48
more

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
um Section 8 or 30 30 Ami units but 48
 
01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:08.930 align:start position:0%
um Section 8 or 30 30 Ami units but 48
is

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
in a month's time you probably got 30 40
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
people signing up for uh Section 8
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
Housing and it's a six to eight year
 
01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.930 align:start position:0%
Housing and it's a six to eight year
wait

01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
wait
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
believe me I know
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
um Mr Belanger
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
um I worked for the Housing partnership
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth a few years ago and we had
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
a an affordable housing development
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
there are actually two
 
01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.830 align:start position:0%
there are actually two
houses

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
houses
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
um in Farmington
 
01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.270 align:start position:0%
um in Farmington
the

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
the buildings
 
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
were going to be sold and we're building
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
a new development
 
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
um it was going to be
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
not Section 8 but it was it was going to
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
be a tax credit property and um so the
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
folks who lived in the affordable units
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
prior to the new construction were
 
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
entitled to the uniform relocation act
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
which meant that we had tenants who
 
01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.010 align:start position:0%
which meant that we had tenants who
um

01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
who's whose income
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
was too high to relocate to the new
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
development and those folks got those
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
Ura funds have you read much of that
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
happening at all I have not heard that
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
happening but again we you know we kind
 
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.189 align:start position:0%
happening but again we you know we kind
of

01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
get the money from the federal
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
government we work with non-profit
 
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
Partners who are kind of the direct
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
interface with the tenants so our Pro
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
our partners may have heard of that but
 
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
that's not something that I've run into
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's something to look out to
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
look out for that if you know a building
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
is closing and it's going to be
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
redeveloped and there are federal funds
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
then the tenants who are being displaced
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for Ura funds we
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
actually had one tenant who
 
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
ended up with enough money for a down
 
01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
payment on a house he got about
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand dollars in Ura so
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
all right I want to apologize for being
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
late at a meeting but thank you
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy for taking over
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
um are there any other questions City
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester planning department thank you
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
for coming by the way I've been holding
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
mine back go ahead representative Rudy
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay and thank you Mr chairman I got a
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
couple of things
 
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.209 align:start position:0%
couple of things
um

01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
we're mentioning the cost of
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
construction for these new new homes and
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
building cost Iowa building costs our
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
labor costs are what labor cost is and
 
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.169 align:start position:0%
labor costs are what labor cost is and
uh

01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
trying to think of a way to lower
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
besides the impact fee is uh what about
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
the inspection fees now inspection fees
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
can be a little crazy too especially on
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
a big project
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
have you thought about when somebody
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
comes in you charge them one flat fee
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
and that covers all the inspections uh
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
just to relieve a little bit of their
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
cost on construction
 
01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh we could certainly look into that we
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
actually do have a provision that was
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
enacted into our local building code a
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
few years ago in which
 
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
um if the any affordable unit you know
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
rent capped unit we we will defer
 
01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
building inspection fees until
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy so that's you
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
know time is money for developers so
 
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
they get to hang on to that money for a
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
significantly longer period of time they
 
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
eventually do have to pay it but it is a
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
way to kind of defer that and allow them
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
to use that money for longer
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
um you know ultimately we want to make
 
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
sure that we cover our costs to the
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
extent that we can and that's what the
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
billing inspection fees are intended to
 
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
do but not not opposed to looking at it
 
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
further and taking suggestions about you
 
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
know how we could maybe trim costs but
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that you know it's
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
if someone's paying the taxpayers are
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
paying or the developer is paying so we
 
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
need to balance that
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you for that and I
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
didn't expect to be talking about
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
bicycle Lanes today yeah
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and I wasn't really crazy about them
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
when they first went in because I almost
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
saw a couple of accidents because I
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
traveled Maple Street a lot and I saw a
 
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
couple pretty close calls
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
um but I was asked a question just the
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
other day I lived near the golf course
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh dairyfield and somebody asked me
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
about driving a golf course uh dear golf
 
01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
about driving a golf course uh dear golf
cart

01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
cart
 
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.689 align:start position:0%
cart
no

01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
are the golf carts allowed in the
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
bicycle Lanes General and then also
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
besides that we have a former State Rep
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
who you can see all over town in her
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
wheelchair I've seen her with an
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
umbrella riding around in the rain and
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
she goes down Valley Street a lot now
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
and there's no sidewalk there so
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't those bicycle Lanes be open to
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
those wheelchairs yeah that's a great
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
question generally if it's an internal
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
combustion engine vehicle no matter how
 
01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
small usually those don't go in the bike
 
01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
Lanes however you can look to some other
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
um countries that have done a lot more
 
01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
with bicycle Lanes such as the
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
Netherlands and they have a lot of
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
accommodation for folks with different
 
01:14:59.810 --> 01:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
abilities so if you have someone who
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
needs to get around in something
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh like that if if it doesn't belong on
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk but it would be dangerous
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
to be in the road then certainly there
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
are ways to accommodate them in a
 
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
bicycle travel Lane
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I think also it's important for us to
 
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
think about the the difference uh
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
different the different ways basically
 
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
that you could build a bicycle lane
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes when a municipality is first
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
starting out with constructing them
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
um perhaps with the Maple Street ones
 
01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what was the first in the
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester it's not always the
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
best design and so it requires the
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
mindset of being able to adapt and kind
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
of iterate on a design to improve it and
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
then eventually if it turns out that it
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
is an idea that the community is on
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
board with you can sometimes formalize
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
those painted bike Lanes with either
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
curbing or with something else
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
um obviously taking into account the
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
ability of the local departments to
 
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
manage it so for example DPW in
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester would need to be able to both
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
construct it and then also maintain it
 
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
through all four seasons and so that's
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
some something to consider as well but
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
ensuring the safety of everyone who uses
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
the roadway is really important we have
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
had deaths in Manchester on our streets
 
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
and it's nothing that you know we you
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
know you can't necessarily prevent
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
everything but there are certainly
 
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
things we could do to design our
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
roadways better in terms of how it ties
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
in with affordable housing and improving
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis again for me it comes
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
back down to how everything is related
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
and how the cost of building a
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
development might be tied in part to how
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
many parking parking spaces you're
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
requiring the developer to build and
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
then also will people who want to move
 
01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
into this development be able to get
 
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
around if they don't have a car and if
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
the answer is no then automatically you
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
know let's say you're building a
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom apartment which we don't
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily have enough of in Manchester
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
well if you have three bedrooms you're
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
probably either going to have a family
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
or at least two roommates that means you
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
might have two cars if they don't have
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
another way to get around so it all kind
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
of relates obviously when you're
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
focusing directly on housing there are a
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
lot of different ways you could go but
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
it's just one thing that I think is
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
important to keep in mind okay one
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
follower okay thank you now
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
on the planning board and this happened
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
to me I
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
we sold a house
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
it was an extra lot with it but when we
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
looked at it it was just barely short of
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
a second building lot okay I mean like a
 
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.030 align:start position:0%
a second building lot okay I mean like a
foot

01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
foot
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
and so I I took my client to the most
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
popular engineer in town and he says
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're a foot shot you're going to need
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
a variance well
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden I'll go through a
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
variance in a heavily populated area my
 
01:17:42.169 --> 01:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
client figured it wasn't going to be
 
01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:44.540 align:start position:0%
worth it it wasn't going to pass
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
if if I was a foot shot here
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
and I went in for a building permit and
 
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
the neighbor showed up and they said no
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
no no that lot's too small
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
how much weight do you put on the
 
01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.910 align:start position:0%
how much weight do you put on the
neighbors

01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
so as someone who serves on a board I
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
don't serve on the zoning board so I
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't know their exact thought process
 
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
but I know they have to meet five
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
criteria in terms of whether they
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
approve the variance or not
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
from the planning board perspective we
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
take all of the public comment um under
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
consideration and a Butter's concerns
 
01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
are really important to us part of what
 
01:18:21.169 --> 01:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
we do on the planning board is we try to
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
see how could we potentially mitigate
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
some of those concerns if it's a new
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
let's say there's a new restaurant
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's going in next to some residential
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
well if the abutters are concerned about
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
it being really noisy at night we can
 
01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:36.659 align:start position:0%
talk with the developer and see okay
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
well what is the exact plan are there
 
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
certain hours of operation that you have
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
where would the you know would there be
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
any external speakers where would they
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
be pointed Etc et cetera there are
 
01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
different things depending on the
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
development that you can do to make
 
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
everyone kind of
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
if not happy at least satisfied or
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
placated enough that where they're not
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
upset anymore
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
um but in the end it does also come down
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
to balancing the needs of the butters
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
with the needs of the general community
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
and also the property rights of the
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
folks who are bringing the application
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
forward so it's really hard to quantify
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
how important it is but we do take it
 
01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:12.620 align:start position:0%
all under consideration okay yes well
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
this was a residential area and it was a
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
residential house with an extra lot so
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a change of use or anything it
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
was still going to be residential and it
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
was plenty of side yacht so
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering under roll the
 
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
dice uh I wouldn't see much difficulty
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
uh getting that thrown to the current
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
boards that we have for the zba or the
 
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
not sure if it would need to come before
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
the planning board but as director
 
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
Belanger was noting before the the zba
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
in Manchester approves a substantial
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
portion of the applications that come
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
before it so as long as it wouldn't be
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the public in general and
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cause any sort of nuisance
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
which it sounds like it probably
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I would give it high odds of
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
success I mean I had good luck with
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
Manchester they think very good to work
 
01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
with but this wasn't my dime I was
 
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
working with uh so the engineer kind of
 
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
discouraged them but because of the cost
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
and he couldn't guarantee anything so
 
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.530 align:start position:0%
and he couldn't guarantee anything so
anyway

01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.250 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
if I I would like to personally thank
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
you guys for coming
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
um Manchester is my city and I'm very

County District 8 which are the nine
 
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
towns of Acworth Langdon lemster Goshen
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
Washington Springfield Sunapee my
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
hometown of Croydon and the City of
 
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
Claremont so there's a lot of diversity
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
in that area in terms of terrain and
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
density and Claremont has a severe
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
housing shortage I realize they're not
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
unique in that
 
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
Southern Tier of reasonable geography to
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
live in and commute to the Upper Valley
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
so I know Josh previously who's seed I'm
 
01:22:07.729 --> 01:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
honored to fill spoke about the acute
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
housing needs for Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
and Dartmouth College and the other
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of startups up there and so forth
 
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.010 align:start position:0%
a lot of startups up there and so forth
um

01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
I've always been fascinated by housing
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
frankly my husband is a retired
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
residential building contractor so just
 
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
sort of immersed in
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
being associated with building processes
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.070 align:start position:0%
for many years
um

01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
I have no background I'm a dietitian
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
diabetes educator by training I was a
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
small business owner for 37 years and
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just very interested in how we solve
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you and welcome to
 
01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
so so we have good if you're fascinated
 
01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
with housing did you see the residential
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
units that Dartmouth Hitchcock put up a
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
few years back through a modulus yes
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's a company I'm a dealer for that
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
company oh wow that's awesome it's
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
amazing what they're doing they're
 
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
building hotels modular hotels
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
they're being very creative they're
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
attractive of course Attractive people
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
vary in what they think that is I think
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
they're attractive
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and there's just so much need
 
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I'm just one other piece
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why I was interested
 
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
in the conversation about cycling and
 
01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.450 align:start position:0%
in the conversation about cycling and
walkability

01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
walkability
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
I have two adult daughters who live in
 
01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
New York City
 
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
and clearly a very very different
 
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
environment than a city the size of
 
01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.630 align:start position:0%
environment than a city the size of
Manchester

01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
but even on a lesser scale looking at
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
the way other communities have evolved
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
to go from being completely car Centric
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
to you can safely bike most of New York
 
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
and it's the fastest way to get anywhere
 
01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
so it's very appealing to people who
 
01:23:59.450 --> 01:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
want efficiency and fitness and cheap
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
and I think it's something we should
 
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
definitely continue to consider
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
great so we have um 30 minutes or so
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
because one of our appointments canceled
 
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.030 align:start position:0%
because one of our appointments canceled
so

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
um I published that we'll have work
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
sessions immediately following
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
presentations so we're following a
 
01:24:14.689 --> 01:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
presentation so I I kind of want to just
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
open this up to the committee um we've
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
heard if you've sat in from day one or
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
whatever there's been a lot that we've
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
heard from various stakeholders I'm
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
um a document that I forwarded to the
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
committee from housing action New
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
I would say pretty
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
accurately sums up
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
things that we are looking at in this
 
01:24:38.209 --> 01:24:38.219 align:start position:0%
committee I think all of these points
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
are things that we brought up as
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
concerns so I kind of want to open it up
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
um our charge is to come up with
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
prospective legislation moving forward
 
01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.310 align:start position:0%
prospective legislation moving forward
so

01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
um who wants to start
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative well thank you but
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
um I want I wanted to
 
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh kind of touch on number three and
 
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
just talk about see if if we like it's
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
talking about you know proposed
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation about Des
 
01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.050 align:start position:0%
legislation about Des
um

01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if we can just get
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
Das in here and have them tell us what
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
this this so that we wouldn't actually
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
have a committee and then we can just
 
01:25:23.169 --> 01:25:23.179 align:start position:0%
solve that you know
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
theoretically solve it sooner than later
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
if if they can answer all the questions
 
01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
and if they can't then then we could
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
possibly have some proposed legislation
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
to study it further
 
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree with that I know there was
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
um some housing units in Goffstown that
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
came up with a snag um through it it
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
some breakdown in negotiations with Des
 
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
so I totally understand that
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
um so I will be reaching out to that
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
department and get them in here so we
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
I'm glad your mic's not on for that
 
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:02.300 align:start position:0%
uh representative Reed yeah
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
atus oh my God oh my God it is so we
 
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
heard I think from every single person
 
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
that spoke and and for multiple people
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
who spoke previously about adus as you
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
know I love my bill very much
 
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
um which we we tabled specifically so
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
that this committee could work on it
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who aren't familiar
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if the chair thought
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
it'd be appropriate for me to kind of go
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
what's in the the bill that I had
 
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
written and then like use that as a
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
launching place but I presume not
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's familiar with the more
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
nuanced details of that representative
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
Yokel looks like he has an opinion
 
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
your mouth was open I would say yes
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
let's look at look at that and then
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
um there's other things in adus I was
 
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
concerned like when a municipality
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's something we need to it so why
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
don't we start a blueprint we we can
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
start with Adu seems like the place that
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee is kind of
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
consensus on it I I was planning on
 
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
getting printouts of the hb423 for our
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
work session today at three o'clock but
 
01:27:05.209 --> 01:27:05.219 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
um people wanted me to just talk about
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
that then or like give you kind of like
 
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
the the highlights of of that now
 
01:27:13.689 --> 01:27:13.699 align:start position:0%
because so much of what was said today
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I would prefer to wait until three to
 
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
discuss your
 
01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.110 align:start position:0%
discuss your
um

01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.450 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:28.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
moving to two
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
um adus what I would like to talk about
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
is thing like right now given that we
 
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
don't have that language in front of us
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
is to talk about some of the things that
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we identified that could be
 
01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:46.820 align:start position:0%
improved with the existing Adu
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
rules as far as you know something like
 
01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:52.820 align:start position:0%
Joe was talking about with the parking
 
01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
parking is um you know changing the
 
01:27:55.739 --> 01:27:57.050 align:start position:0%
parking is um you know changing the
parking

01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
parking
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
um requirements and the existing Adu
 
01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.129 align:start position:0%
um requirements and the existing Adu
area

01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:01.139 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
um changing
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
I would like to see
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
the um a change to uh detached being
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
defined kind of like how you were
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
defining it as far as whether that
 
01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
whether we add an additional Adu
 
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
to that or in the first Adu just having
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
um adus be uh
 
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh allowed to be inside of existing
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
structures per by right and not have
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
what I would like to see representative
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
you're saying exactly the stuff that I
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
was about to say because a lot of 423
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
was dealing with the first uh the first
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
or the existing buy right Adu so in
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
expanding those definitions and
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
increasing the size and things like that
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
I think that what I would like to see is
 
01:28:53.159 --> 01:28:54.290 align:start position:0%
I think that what I would like to see is
um

01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
kind of like what what
 
01:28:59.450 --> 01:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
um Manchester was saying where if you
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
have the Adu being put in the ZX inside
 
01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
an existing structure
 
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
um that you do that it is by writing you
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to like especially
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're stealing my thunder that's so so
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
for those of you who aren't familiar
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
um part of what I wanted to say was and
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
and part of the the where I got the idea
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
of putting in this bill
 
01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
um was that the current buy right
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
statute allows towns to restrict that by
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
right Adu to attached only meaning
 
01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
attached to the primary
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
um unit and I had constituents who had a
 
01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
pre-existing already approved by the
 
01:29:43.129 --> 01:29:43.139 align:start position:0%
town uh detached garage so you're not
 
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
increasing any footprint everything is
 
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
already you know copacetic and yet the
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
town decided to use their ability to
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
interpret that definition of attached is
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
you know not inclusive of completely
 
01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
contained with any pre-existing detached
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
structure and prevent these people from
 
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
putting an Adu for their mother-in-law
 
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
in that detached garage so 423 does
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
change that definition expands the it
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
allows the second one of the two ideas
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
to be detached by right but it's spans
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
the definition of even attached to
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
include completely contained within a a
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
technically detached but pre-existing
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
structure because the idea is you're not
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
building an apartment building in your
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
backyard it's a garage it's still a
 
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
garage it's just now it has a person
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
living in it so do we have broad
 
01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
consensus that that's something that the
 
01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
committee wants to move forward with
 
01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that disagrees with
 
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
that language
 
01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'd like to look at it but it sounds
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
sure representative Reed can you bring
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
in that language that's I was going to
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
have them printed over lunch so we have
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
it ready for three o'clock and we are
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
going to hear I believe from Newmarket
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
Town planner who was helpful in in
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
helping me write the bill and also the
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
Durham Town planner helped as well the
 
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
other thing that I did was allowing the
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
one of those two units there's a lot of
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
things that 423 does but one of those
 
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
two units to go up to a thousand square
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
feet right now towns can restrict it
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
down to 750 and the idea is that if we
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
want housing to not just be affordable
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
but sustainable like as in it's not just
 
01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
for a college student or you know a
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
single person or whatever but people can
 
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
have you know start families in these
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
things and actually use them as
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
long-term housing that really 750 is a
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
bit too small for a lot of people
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
so okay representative Gibbs uh thank
 
01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:34.790 align:start position:0%
so okay representative Gibbs uh thank
you

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
um just a few things Beyond uh adus and
 
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
this is not not necessarily in the order
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
in which I recommend them I just I just
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
put them down in my notes
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
um uh one is that I'd like to look again
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
at infill housing Beyond adus I was
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
honestly very disappointed
 
01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
um at the failure of House Bill 44
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think that there are
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
um uh things that can be worked on there
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
um another is
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
obviously and I think we're mostly on
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
the same page on this
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
um is questions of zoning
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
um uh specifically lot size requirements
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
um some of which
 
01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:21.229 align:start position:0%
um some of which
um

01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
seemed to me to be beyond the realm of
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
reality although I do think we need to
 
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
hear from the engineers regarding uh
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
what's necessary for a septic system
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
honestly I grew up with a septic system
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I was a kid and my father was very
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
good with these things and and
 
01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
um so he dealt with them and nobody ever
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
explained to me how they actually uh how
 
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
they actually worked with what the
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
requirements were
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so that's obviously something that we
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
do need to understand then more
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
generally uh the need for water and
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
sewer and I think perhaps the need for
 
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
some assistance to municipalities
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
um in improving their water and sewer
 
01:33:05.689 --> 01:33:05.699 align:start position:0%
systems or in
 
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
um uh being able to use dedicated impact
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
fees uh to address those issues so those
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
are are obviously serious issues uh but
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
there there should be ways to address
 
01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
them rather than just saying no
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
um which a lot of people have been
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
saying to me and I I don't accept that
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and then the last thing is um I was
 
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
very interested in the presentation
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
um from the city of Dover on transfer of
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
development rights and I haven't really
 
01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
they sent us something I haven't really
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
had had time to go into it
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's uh probably
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
something that we should at least think
 
01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:43.910 align:start position:0%
something that we should at least think
about

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
um so those are the things that I I
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
think we should look at Beyond adus
 
01:33:51.770 --> 01:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you um
 
01:33:53.209 --> 01:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything that's being put
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
forth here at this point in time I think
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
we've identified a couple of different
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
groups of action on action items I would
 
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
say the adus is probably like a low
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit uh we've already got some
 
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
groundwork established there we can all
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
get on the same page we probably have
 
01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
some other subjects that may take a
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
little bit longer to get done but we may
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
be able to get almost like an Omnibus
 
01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
build together and maybe get a couple of
 
01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
things that don't need a lot of work
 
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
put together agreed upon in a rapid
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
fashion I've already got something in
 
01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
with OLS along these regulation areas we
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
might be able to get this done rapidly
 
01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
and have it go on as a trailer to the
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
budget we know the governor is on board
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
with getting these types of things done
 
01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:38.030 align:start position:0%
with getting these types of things done
done

01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes getting these types of things done
 
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
and a couple of small steps would
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
certainly get us you know we're heading
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
right for the End Zone
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh all of these things can be
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
done I think we shouldn't
 
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
leave the adus only to the cities in the
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
rural areas where people have sufficient
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh lot size which would support an
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
additional leech field I do have a bit
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
of a background on this but if you've
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
got a you know a five acre lot or
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
something like that you might be able to
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
have a detached
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
um additional dwelling unit and another
 
01:35:14.689 --> 01:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
small leach field for your mother-in-law
 
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:16.340 align:start position:0%
or anything like that
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
exactly and let's face it I think the
 
01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:22.139 align:start position:0%
bulk of the people that are desirous of
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
adding additional dwelling units to
 
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
their properties are for the the
 
01:35:28.330 --> 01:35:28.340 align:start position:0%
Mother-in-law the father-in-law the
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
recently divorced daughter or offspring
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
something like that and are likely to
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
not need an additional parking spot so
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
those are going to be crucial right the
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
approach like this
 
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get the 20 000 units
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
we need in a year but we're certainly
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
going to get the horses running on the
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
track in Rapid fashion I I completely
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
agree and that much of what you said is
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
it was the point of the original bill
 
01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
um the difference of course just to be
 
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
clear between hb44 which is the four
 
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
Plex and the two main differences
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
um other than the fact that Adu has a
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
technically smaller you know not the
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
primary but the main differences are
 
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
hb44 is specific to City Water and Sewer
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
areas and it allows developers to do
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
that to build these multiplexes
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and adus are only for owner occupiers
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
to build now they can sell and someone
 
01:36:28.129 --> 01:36:28.139 align:start position:0%
can buy it but only owner occupiers can
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
build adus currently and I did not
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
change that in the bill I wanted to ask
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
if everybody on the committee and maybe
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
this is the chair's job to ask like what
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
do people think of the director's
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation about extending the
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
impact fees and holding them for 20
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
years is that something people thought
 
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that makes a lot of sense
 
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
only because when you're looking down
 
01:36:57.850 --> 01:36:57.860 align:start position:0%
the road like the financing or whatever
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
that'll help and those funds will be
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
available for
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
you're there and it you know because I
 
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
know Builders have a way of doing things
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
and then running away so yes I do but to
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
keep the funds I think that only makes a
 
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
lot of sense and it makes it makes the
 
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
process easier for the municipality too
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
because it strikes me as the kind of
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
thing we could slip into
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
an Omnibus like you know thing I
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.530 align:start position:0%
 
it I

01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
it I
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
I think that we should move forward as a
 
01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:39.530 align:start position:0%
I think that we should move forward as a
committee

01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
in September the proper channels allow
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
vetting of all of our bills in
 
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
committees that
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
um are not this one
 
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
um but I I think I want to see multiple
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
bills as regard instead of one bill
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
because it's easier to
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
for an idea to fail if it's one big idea
 
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
then 12 small ideas so I think we should
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
think small and I'm an incrementalist in
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
policy I don't try to over over extend
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
everything I'm still partial to
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace wanting to like
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
just get something in now I know let's
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
do something now yeah appreciate that
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
um the the one difference
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
that I would say is that there are a
 
01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:24.179 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that have already had
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
some public hearings and maybe those
 
01:38:29.209 --> 01:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
ought to be brought to the front of the
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
pack and maybe not weight to it so
 
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
remember if we can have a you know a
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
Germain Amendment somewheres
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
um you know yeah Budget Trailer bill
 
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:37.850 align:start position:0%
um you know yeah Budget Trailer bill
um

01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
I think there's some simple low-hanging
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
fruit that might not require as much
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
yeah valid point the Optics of it if we
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
delay on this this committee was formed
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
to make some uh you know good analysis
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
and make some recommendations because
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
this isn't a new problem so you know
 
01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
putting that pause button even if it's
 
01:38:59.090 --> 01:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
only for a couple of months yeah the
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
objects might not be the best
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
just throw your mic on for it a couple
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
different things
 
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.390 align:start position:0%
different things
um

01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
it seems like there could be a middle
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
ground between
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
maybe not an omni bus bill but saying
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
what could we accomplish a handful of
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
imminently even if it's just small
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
impact at least as a step in the right
 
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.189 align:start position:0%
impact at least as a step in the right
direction

01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
and building support for working on this
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
problem I'm sorry to harp on this please
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
talk into the mic
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
you can move it you know
 
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
yeah how's that
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
um so oh that's much better thank you
 
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
but overall I do agree that
 
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
we should do this deliberately I'm
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
frankly not a huge fan of attaching
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
everything to the budget bill I don't
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
think it's a good process good democracy
 
01:39:53.209 --> 01:39:53.219 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
01:39:53.219 --> 01:39:55.250 align:start position:0%
if you will
separately

01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
separately
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I noted one of the speakers this
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
morning commented on this
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
we need an education or PR campaign on
 
01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:03.110 align:start position:0%
we need an education or PR campaign on
adus

01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
adus
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
because I think in the rural areas also
 
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
there are loads of opportunities for
 
01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
them to be developed and they're just
 
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
not on people's radar at all
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
um so I think looking at who would be
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for that and what kind of
 
01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
funding would it take to Simply Market
 
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
to the public you can do this
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's not an immediate impact not
 
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to jump on it but I
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
oh and also and this comes from
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
working on education committee
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
whatever we could collaboratively do to
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
increase the labor for building through
 
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
our CTE schools maybe through some sort
 
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
of partnership or credit arrangement
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
with developers I mean we
 
01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
part of the crisis is we don't have the
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
I know representative
 
01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:06.290 align:start position:0%
I know representative
representative

01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I don't know a lot about water
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
and sewer impact fees and I did notice
 
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
that it was suggested that those fees be
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
held on reserve instead of like in an
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
account but I also wonder about the the
 
01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh inflation Factor on those funds I
 
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
mean how do you
 
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
let's say it's you know your water your
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
impact fee is ten thousand dollars now
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
and you sit you're putting it in reserve
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
your pattern numbers are for 10 years
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
how much is it going to be worth in 10
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
years so how do you how do you keep
 
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
increasing and make making sure that the
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
yield is more
 
01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.810 align:start position:0%
yield is more
okay

01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
um representative yokella then
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
does anyone have an answer
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
well I was just going I think they put
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
in a savings account yeah but
 
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.450 align:start position:0%
in a savings account yeah but
um

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so
 
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I think that is
 
01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:09.290 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I think that is
um

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
not on adus but is low hanging fruit is
 
01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
not on adus but is low hanging fruit is
to

01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
um is we just as the the people in
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester said we just adopted this new
 
01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:21.550 align:start position:0%
Manchester said we just adopted this new
um

01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
zoning that allows for tiny homes and
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
that are not zoning this uh building
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
code that allows for tiny homes but some
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities because we didn't
 
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
have that infra that that opportunity
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
previously had set many many uh lot or
 
01:42:47.209 --> 01:42:47.219 align:start position:0%
uh house size requirements
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe those now that we
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
have this tiny home
 
01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:53.699 align:start position:0%
um building code are appropriate anymore
 
01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
and so I would like to see a no minimum
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
size house size
 
01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.430 align:start position:0%
size house size
um

01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh record like past you know Statewide
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
just as we passed this new zoning or
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
this new
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
um building code to accommodate those
 
01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:15.659 align:start position:0%
smaller types of homes that those be
 
01:43:16.970 --> 01:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
able to be built because in
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities like
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
the one I'm in had
 
01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
something saying you can't you have to
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
build 600 square feet and when I went to
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
my town and asked them why they were
 
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
just like this is how it always has been
 
01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
even though now we have
 
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
um uh building codes that would allow
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
for smaller houses to be built safely
 
01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
and and appropriately so
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
um and I was thinking about as far as
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
like the funding for water and sewer I
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
think that if the state was encouraging
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
either give
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
maybe utilizing the um the Housing
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
Authority that that loans out money
 
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
um if they were able to loan out money
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
or give you know municipalities
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
um a better uh
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities for investing in that that
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
sewer infrastructure
 
01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:18.659 align:start position:0%
um that we put strings attached that
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
they have smaller lot size requirements
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
on all of those all of the Lots attached
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
to any of those
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
um monies that we helped
 
01:44:30.649 --> 01:44:30.659 align:start position:0%
not that we're giving the money away
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily but even if we did give the
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
money away but if if
 
01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.450 align:start position:0%
money away but if if
um

01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
we just give them a better interest rate
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
or whatever then we tied some strings
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
onto that for at least the life of you
 
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
know the loan the loan or whatever that
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
they have to have you know lot
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that are
 
01:44:50.689 --> 01:44:50.699 align:start position:0%
and I'd also like to see from Des them
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
have a specific like you know grade of
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
ground equals this many lot or this many
 
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
bedrooms so that we as a state can say
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
what is reasonable and what is not
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable if we even do something on
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
the outside of saying
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
double you can do double the amount of
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
requirement that that it requires for
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
for the ground to be able to Leach on
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
these things that are not attached to
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
water and septic but over double is just
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
overreach and and is no longer
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate something along those lines
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to see you know a lot of
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
the people in in Municipal and County
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
government they were worried about like
 
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
what is going on with you know why
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
aren't adus actually being used some of
 
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
that is education some of them is the
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
the current regulations being
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
um limiting detached and limiting the
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
size and limiting all of these things
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
and so adding an additional Adu doesn't
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
really help if you can't get the first
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
one because of all of these restrictions
 
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
and then there's also kind of like the
 
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
the concern from Municipal and County if
 
01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
you're if you're planning to spend them
 
01:45:59.149 --> 01:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
send them through their normal
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
committees that they're going to be like
 
01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:02.450 align:start position:0%
committees that they're going to be like
well

01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
why is why should we be forcing this
 
01:46:08.209 --> 01:46:08.219 align:start position:0%
municipality to do it this way and I
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
know in my community one of the
 
01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
communities that I represent that
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
they're like I don't want you to
 
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
override us because we are doing
 
01:46:16.609 --> 01:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
something like this where we're saying
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know for Wetlands if you have a
 
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
wetland setback based on your soil type
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
if the soil type is X you have this much
 
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
Wetland set back if you have it this you
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
have a different setback and they don't
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
want overruling on that but I think that
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
we should be encouraging more of that
 
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
like fact-based
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
um zoning instead of arbitrary two acre
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
five acre 10 acre whatever and I also
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
like the idea of you know
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
um putting
 
01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
putting these
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
um saying that you can't forbid you know
 
01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
things that are already existing
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
especially like your historic district
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
that you say that you love this historic
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
district but then you make it illegal I
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
think those things are low-hanging fruit
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
that this this this committee may be
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
able to get the Senate on board and
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
Pitch them the idea and if they like it
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
they can put it in the budget it's on
 
01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:14.699 align:start position:0%
them it's not on us right we are just
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
the house we don't we could we already
 
01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
passed the budget what are we going to
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
add a trailer bill on right we just
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
pitch it to the to the Senate and they
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
add it right and so it's not necessarily
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
on us I don't think okay I'm gonna go um
 
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs and representative
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
um back to representative DiLorenzo's
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
point about
 
01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
um uh impact holding on to impact fees
 
01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:38.699 align:start position:0%
and inflation
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's no there's never a
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
perfect answer to questions about
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
inflation uh but you also can't predict
 
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
how much inflation there's going to be
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
um I mean there have been periods of
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
time when it's been very low other
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
periods when it's been high so you can't
 
01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
predict how that's going to affect it
 
01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
and in any case
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
um right now uh if I understood
 
01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
um right now uh if I understood
correctly

01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.250 align:start position:0%
correctly
um

01:48:03.250 --> 01:48:03.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
the city
 
01:48:07.729 --> 01:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
um Can Only Hold On To the funds for six
 
01:48:07.739 --> 01:48:08.810 align:start position:0%
um Can Only Hold On To the funds for six
years

01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
um so if the question is between being
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
able to hold on to the funds for 10 or
 
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
15 years and having it having the amount
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
of money being worth a little less and
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
having to give it all back after six
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
years if you haven't quite been able to
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
um work out all the economic and
 
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic ramifications of how to use
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
the funds
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
um the city will be better off uh being
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
able to use it uh after 10 years
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
even if it's worth a little bit less so
 
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
I think that's worth doing even if we
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
can't completely account for inflation
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
I agree with that uh representative Reed
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
no just there's so many things to
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
respond to now
 
01:48:54.850 --> 01:48:54.860 align:start position:0%
one would hope that the city could like
 
01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
do CDs or something if they know that
 
01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
they have it for a certain number of
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
years and that that interest that they
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
would be getting at the end of those CDs
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
would hopefully account for inflation
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so back to everything that
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative yokella said like I know
 
01:49:11.689 --> 01:49:11.699 align:start position:0%
I don't want to scare representative
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
yokella but we are of the same mind on
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
all of those points
 
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.010 align:start position:0%
all of those points
um

01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so I had actually already written in
 
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
my own notes to tie lot minimum sizes to
 
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
what the water and septic was capable of
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
in some way shape or form like you said
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
it could be double or whatever but
 
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
making that proportional and the reason
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
I we we had a few weeks ago a
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
presentation where we were told the
 
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
history of these kind of zoning
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
ordinances and how it all originally
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
came back to health safety and Welfare
 
01:49:46.609 --> 01:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
of the people and how that mission creep
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
had moved so far afield over the last
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
hundred years to where now it's like
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
well we really like 20 acre minimums or
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
we really like 4 000 square foot homes
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
and and to the tiny home I want to make
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
a a public commitment right now to help
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative yokila with any bill that
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
will remove the square foot minimums
 
01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
from buildings or from houses in
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
particular and also I think bedroom
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
requirements because as the Director
 
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
said there was like Loft you know like
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
that wasn't considered a bedroom and so
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed but removing that as
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
well because again it has to go back to
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
health safety and Welfare and if it's
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
safe for someone to live in then it
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
should be permissible and it shouldn't
 
01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
be up to
 
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
um the the NIMBY effect
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
um and then something that
 
01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative Damon said about the
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
education piece and I think
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative basically answered it for
 
01:50:40.729 --> 01:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
me so yes you know having education
 
01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
around adus is great but I think one of
 
01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
the reasons that people aren't doing it
 
01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
now isn't even so much the education
 
01:50:50.209 --> 01:50:50.219 align:start position:0%
piece as it is that they are currently
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
restricted from being able to take
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of their right to build that
 
01:50:56.570 --> 01:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
first Adu by right because of the
 
01:50:59.330 --> 01:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
detached and because of the the the size
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
and all the other restrictions in the
 
01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:02.699 align:start position:0%
parking that that municipalities are
 
01:51:05.649 --> 01:51:05.659 align:start position:0%
allowed to put on that so changing that
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
will not only open the door for the
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
first Adu but also for the second so I
 
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
think I got through most of everything I
 
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
hadn't stored up
 
01:51:17.689 --> 01:51:17.699 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Wallace thank you
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
and just to address the the septic uh
 
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
leech rate issue um every single septic
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
system that's designed and approved in
 
01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire at this point
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
in time has its own file and the
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
particulars to that Leach rate the type
 
01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:33.179 align:start position:0%
of soils there's about 15 or 20
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
different types so what I'm driving at
 
01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
is it's not going to be a a linear
 
01:51:40.490 --> 01:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
equation if you will that if you've got
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
a three three bedroom approved septic
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
that you can go double that that's going
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
to be a function of the types of soils
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
proximity to Wetlands and things like
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
that so that's going to be a little bit
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
different than in a city with city sewer
 
01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
where you can just look at the flow
 
01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:55.139 align:start position:0%
rates of the whole system just something
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
to consider okay representative I I
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to respond to
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
that I was trying to tie the lot size
 
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
requirement to the to the soil type not
 
01:52:08.689 --> 01:52:08.699 align:start position:0%
the actual like how many bedrooms you
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
could have per per uh like leach field
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever that
 
01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:15.890 align:start position:0%
or whatever that
um

01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm trying to drive at is on
 
01:52:23.709 --> 01:52:23.719 align:start position:0%
the municipal and County government
 
01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:27.500 align:start position:0%
committee they are
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
they much more prefer to have latitude
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
as far as local municipalities being
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:36.649 align:start position:0%
able to
um

01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:36.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:40.139 align:start position:0%
do adjust some things and so what I
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
think is the best way to approach it is
 
01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:45.659 align:start position:0%
to say no we're not mandating you do
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
something we're putting up guard rails
 
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
for these are the appropriate areas for
 
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
which you to have your flexibility
 
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
but 20 acre lot requirement is not
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
flexible that is unreasonable and where
 
01:53:02.590 --> 01:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
is that guideline or where is that that
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
threshold I think that Des could help us
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
say like hey for this type of soil
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
um requiring two acres makes sense for
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
this type of soil requiring five acres
 
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense you know that kind of
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
thing and then maybe even have a
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
um some type of uh
 
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
function where they have they in the
 
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
municipality that you can come and say
 
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
hey my soil type is actually something
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
other than my zone or whatever that or
 
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall in this
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
um normal range uh you know you can go
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
to the go to
 
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
um maybe the zba or something and say
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
hey my soil type is just on the
 
01:53:52.729 --> 01:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
borderline or whatever can I have it be
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
in this one
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
um versus that one because I'm only
 
01:53:59.930 --> 01:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
planning I'm I I'm going to you know do
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
a smaller lot size but I'm also going to
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know put in my deed that I'm only
 
01:54:07.129 --> 01:54:07.139 align:start position:0%
going to have three bedrooms Max on this
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
property instead of
 
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
you know unlimited which is the normal
 
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
amount right and so that you can come in
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
and do that kind of negotiation with
 
01:54:19.129 --> 01:54:19.139 align:start position:0%
your soil type coming in saying that
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
this is what Des says is like the what
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
they recommend as maximum or the minimum
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
and then you know I think that's
 
01:54:29.689 --> 01:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
generally what DH is coming up and
 
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
saying so I'm thinking like legislative
 
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
are you saying
 
01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:36.050 align:start position:0%
are you saying
um

01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:37.580 align:start position:0%
like Min
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
a minimum lot size no greater than 25
 
01:54:44.689 --> 01:54:44.699 align:start position:0%
more than what the Des recommendation or
 
01:54:45.890 --> 01:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
something like that sort of language
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
right so I would I would like giving the
 
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
flexibility right absolutely absolutely
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
so Des comes in says like you know soil
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
type one has can support three bedrooms
 
01:54:59.930 --> 01:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
per thousand square feet or something
 
01:55:03.169 --> 01:55:03.179 align:start position:0%
like that and we say okay you the
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
municipality can limit that to 1.5 per
 
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet or something like
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.850 align:start position:0%
that and
um

01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
so you're less doing it on on size but
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
instead on per unit because really
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
the the municipality I've there the
 
01:55:28.609 --> 01:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
reason why we're limiting it is I think
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
that if you want to have you know uh 20
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
acres or whatever you could put a bunch
 
01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
of units on that or if you want to have
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
a small lot with one one
 
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know home or one room
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
then why can you do that right one
 
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
bedroom it makes more sense
 
01:55:49.490 --> 01:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
I I understand the wanting to do the
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
bedroom but I'm concerned that
 
01:55:53.090 --> 01:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities may see that as like more
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
of an overreach than going to just like
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
no greater than like a certain
 
01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
percentage of like a minimum lot like
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
that that the soil can sustain right
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
because we want to create a like options
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
for them but not like limit it to like
 
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
bedroom like have like four bedrooms
 
01:56:14.090 --> 01:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
right that's um representative Gibbs
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
rather than the specifics isn't the
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
point really that we want the
 
01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
requirements to be evidence-based rather
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
than arbitrary which is what they
 
01:56:32.330 --> 01:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
frequently are now
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
um somebody says well we think there
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
should be this amount of of space
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
between houses and so that's what got
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
written into the law 30 years ago and
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
it's still there
 
01:56:43.450 --> 01:56:43.460 align:start position:0%
um but rather you're talking about
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based in terms of what the
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
engineers can tell us is actually needed
 
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
in certain soil types of certain types
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
of septic system that makes sense
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
um it also makes sense to me to provide
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
some options
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
um that's always a good idea uh but then
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
the second point is
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
um although the municipalities
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
um uh are certainly going to object if
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
they see us mandating uh certain things
 
01:57:16.490 --> 01:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
even so don't we as legislators have a
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the state sorry to the
 
01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:23.699 align:start position:0%
state overall uh that we know that the
 
01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
state has a housing shortage problem a
 
01:57:30.189 --> 01:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
serious housing shortage problem where
 
01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that need to hire workers
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
can't hire workers because those workers
 
01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
can't find an affordable place to live
 
01:57:41.209 --> 01:57:41.219 align:start position:0%
and as a previous presentation uh was
 
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
telling us uh people whose rents are
 
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.659 align:start position:0%
being increased have to move but they
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
can't find a place to move because they
 
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
can't find an affordable place to live
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
and we as legislators have
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to deal with those
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
problems even if that means being a
 
01:57:59.570 --> 01:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
little more mandatory than certainly
 
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
some of the municipalities would like
 
01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
okay so just to sum sum this up I'm
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
seeing adus as an area
 
01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing Des soil types so this so one
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
of the next meetings needs to be with
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
the with des and then I'm also seeing
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
to get some back Base information
 
01:58:21.649 --> 01:58:21.659 align:start position:0%
regarding soil types and um I'm also
 
01:58:21.659 --> 01:58:23.149 align:start position:0%
regarding soil types and um I'm also
seeing

01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
um code building codes and code
 
01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement we're going to hear from
 
01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
Bill McKinney after lunch about building
 
01:58:32.209 --> 01:58:32.219 align:start position:0%
code in code enforcement and inspections
 
01:58:32.219 --> 01:58:33.169 align:start position:0%
code in code enforcement and inspections
so

01:58:33.169 --> 01:58:33.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
I that's like kind of three buckets do
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
we see like we're gonna go for lunch now
 
01:58:40.370 --> 01:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
but do we see any other kind of subject
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
areas that you'd like to talk about at
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
I never saw that before
 
01:58:54.119 --> 01:58:54.770 align:start position:0%
I never saw that before
um

01:58:54.770 --> 01:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
so there may be some prior discussion of
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
this that I'm not aware of yet I haven't
 
01:59:01.129 --> 01:59:01.139 align:start position:0%
finished watching the second half of uh
 
01:59:04.129 --> 01:59:04.139 align:start position:0%
February meeting yet
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
but I know in Sunapee and some of the
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
other communities there's a significant
 
01:59:11.570 --> 01:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
issue with airbnbs taking over what were
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
Residential Properties has that been
 
01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:15.050 align:start position:0%
Residential Properties has that been
discussed

01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
I know there's I know there's
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
legislation in the Senate I believe or
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
there was legislation I'm sure I'm sure
 
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:23.639 align:start position:0%
representative Reed would be able to
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
tell us about that but
 
01:59:25.139 --> 01:59:26.089 align:start position:0%
tell us about that but
um

01:59:26.089 --> 01:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
it's something we can look at for sure I
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
know that's an issue especially in
 
01:59:33.530 --> 01:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
Conway and other areas of the state yeah
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
so last term there was a bill and oh boy
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
Airbnb since uh yeah so some some some
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
some high dollar lobbyists
 
01:59:47.450 --> 01:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
um in the Adu build this was pointed out
 
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's like well what if people start to
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
build adus just for airbnbs and that's
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
not what we want we want housing
 
01:59:55.370 --> 01:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
um so in the bill and this is what I
 
01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
worked very very closely with the
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
municipal Association on
 
02:00:02.689 --> 02:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
um there is the ability to restrict the
 
02:00:03.649 --> 02:00:03.659 align:start position:0%
second and it doesn't it's not
 
02:00:05.209 --> 02:00:05.219 align:start position:0%
chronologically this second is if you
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
have two adus one of them the town can
 
02:00:09.649 --> 02:00:09.659 align:start position:0%
restrict that to a certain rental level
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
and D so a that helps as in affordable
 
02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and a that helps get to affordability
 
02:00:18.890 --> 02:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
and it's wonderful because the people
 
02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
who are doing this are owner occupiers
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
so they're not like as driven to get
 
02:00:25.490 --> 02:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
like high profit return as a developer
 
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
is so they're just looking to defray
 
02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
some of their mortgage but then the
 
02:00:31.609 --> 02:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
other thing is what that does is in
 
02:00:34.250 --> 02:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
effect it prevents the the Airbnb
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
problem because if you get that level of
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
income if you average out that nightly
 
02:00:42.050 --> 02:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
amount that you'd be getting would be
 
02:00:44.089 --> 02:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
way more than what the Restriction would
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
be and so
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
um without actually going into
 
02:00:49.129 --> 02:00:49.139 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals which I didn't want
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
to do in the bill because I knew I would
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
get all these Airbnb lobbies come
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
flooding Concord
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
um we were able to kind of skirt that
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
problem by saying this is a way by
 
02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
making it affordable just one of the
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
second I didn't want to touch the first
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
Adu at all I wanted to leave all of the
 
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
rights and expand the rights for the
 
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
first Adu but for a second Adu
 
02:01:14.570 --> 02:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
um by doing that we get we negate the
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
um drive for people to build adus for
 
02:01:19.010 --> 02:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
for short-term rentals okay um I'm gonna
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
let representative Damon have the last
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
say and then we'll go to lunch so just a
 
02:01:25.010 --> 02:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
quick response I appreciate that and it
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
makes great sense for the adus
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
but what I'm also aware of is
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
buildings that were four to six
 
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
apartments that are now completely
 
02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
Airbnb and therefore no longer available
 
02:01:41.450 --> 02:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
as residential property so I think
 
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
that's a separate piece with lots of
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
lobbyists involved
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you all right um we're going to
 
03:04:20.809 --> 03:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:23.990 --> 03:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
all right this is a committee on housing
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
we are going to have a little delay
 
03:04:28.849 --> 03:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
where we've got a technical problem with
 
03:04:28.859 --> 03:04:31.429 align:start position:0%
where we've got a technical problem with
the

03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:18.830 --> 03:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.670 --> 03:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh 108 p.m a special
 
03:08:25.070 --> 03:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee on housing I want to welcome

some of the affordable housing issues
 
03:09:29.929 --> 03:09:29.939 align:start position:0%
that are going on in New Hampshire so a
 
03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
little bit about New Hampshire building
 
03:09:34.250 --> 03:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
officials Association or nhboa which
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'll refer to is it's a Professional
 
03:09:39.790 --> 03:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
Organization it was organized in 1965
 
03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
basically as a networking type
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
organization so that there was good
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
communication going on between building
 
03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
and building and fire officials dating
 
03:09:50.510 --> 03:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
way back we've
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
our organization is made up of code
 
03:09:55.250 --> 03:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
officials both firearm building zoning
 
03:09:58.969 --> 03:09:58.979 align:start position:0%
officials planners contractors licensed
 
03:10:01.550 --> 03:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
design professionals so we are not you
 
03:10:03.410 --> 03:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
know segregated to just code officials
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
we we want anybody in the construction
 
03:10:07.010 --> 03:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
industry to be part of our organization
 
03:10:10.429 --> 03:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
so that we can have good communication
 
03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
when the organization again when it
 
03:10:13.969 --> 03:10:13.979 align:start position:0%
originally started it was kind of a
 
03:10:15.710 --> 03:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
networking group but we've evolved over
 
03:10:17.630 --> 03:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
that now and what we do is we provide
 
03:10:19.730 --> 03:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
monthly training to our members in the
 
03:10:23.630 --> 03:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire uh every second two
 
03:10:26.210 --> 03:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
second Wednesday of the month and those
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
can be anywhere from three hours just as
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
much as six hours depending upon the
 
03:10:32.269 --> 03:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
training that we're offering so in our
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
in our training is is focused on code
 
03:10:39.050 --> 03:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
code updates uh state state statute
 
03:10:41.090 --> 03:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
um any updates to State Statute and any
 
03:10:41.100 --> 03:10:42.170 align:start position:0%
um any updates to State Statute and any
product

03:10:42.170 --> 03:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
product
 
03:10:44.210 --> 03:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
um uh updates that are happening out
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
there in the field that we feel code
 
03:10:48.370 --> 03:10:48.380 align:start position:0%
officials should really be focusing on
 
03:10:50.750 --> 03:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
we also are very involved in the code
 
03:10:52.849 --> 03:10:52.859 align:start position:0%
development and adoption process we work
 
03:10:54.170 --> 03:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
very closely with the building code
 
03:10:56.809 --> 03:10:56.819 align:start position:0%
review board uh the State Fire Marshal's
 
03:10:58.969 --> 03:10:58.979 align:start position:0%
Office our Home Builders Association the
 
03:11:01.250 --> 03:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
state associated general contractors and
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders to work through the
 
03:11:06.769 --> 03:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
whole code review and code adoption
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
process so that we're trying to bring in
 
03:11:10.610 --> 03:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
what really works for New Hampshire even
 
03:11:14.870 --> 03:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
if there's amendments involved and
 
03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are keeping our
 
03:11:19.070 --> 03:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
currents up to date as much as possible
 
03:11:23.450 --> 03:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
and the the association is very involved
 
03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the state legislation process for any
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that's proposed it will
 
03:11:30.290 --> 03:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
affect the building of Life Safety codes
 
03:11:33.410 --> 03:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:35.870 --> 03:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
so when we use the term codes I always
 
03:11:38.269 --> 03:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
like to say everybody likes to put them
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
all into one container and the building
 
03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
you know the codes in New Hampshire are
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
really when you look at that container
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's several buckets and people forget
 
03:11:48.769 --> 03:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
that right so as we open up the
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
container and look inside you've got the
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
building and building systems codes
 
03:11:54.349 --> 03:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
which also involves Plumbing electrical
 
03:11:54.359 --> 03:11:55.969 align:start position:0%
which also involves Plumbing electrical
mechanical

03:11:55.969 --> 03:11:55.979 align:start position:0%
mechanical
 
03:11:58.490 --> 03:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
um you have Fire and Life Safety housing
 
03:12:00.830 --> 03:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
regulations and standards Health codes
 
03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
are enrolled into that and then land use
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
and zoning regulations if we take that
 
03:12:06.889 --> 03:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
we group it all into one and then I
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
think it kind of gets kind of convoluted
 
03:12:10.670 --> 03:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to look at affordable
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
housing issue as to what code is really
 
03:12:15.950 --> 03:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
affecting housing and affordable housing
 
03:12:17.690 --> 03:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:19.010 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
um

03:12:19.010 --> 03:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
so when you look at a code official the
 
03:12:22.969 --> 03:12:22.979 align:start position:0%
title code official there's actually
 
03:12:25.250 --> 03:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
many titles that also roll into that
 
03:12:27.469 --> 03:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
there's the building official
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
themselves they are typically the leader
 
03:12:32.570 --> 03:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
of the department they set policy set
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
budget there's a plans examiner that's
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
involved in in the process and that is
 
03:12:39.170 --> 03:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
the person that is involved with
 
03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
um plan and document review acceptance
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
and and verification for Code Compliance
 
03:12:46.969 --> 03:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
permit technicians permit technicians I
 
03:12:48.410 --> 03:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
always like to refer to as the
 
03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
ambassadors to our the to our
 
03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
departments and they are the people that
 
03:12:54.410 --> 03:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
the public deals with first they answer
 
03:12:56.330 --> 03:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
the phone they're there to answer emails
 
03:12:58.849 --> 03:12:58.859 align:start position:0%
they intake permits and in many cases
 
03:13:00.290 --> 03:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that actually final
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
accept payment and actually issue
 
03:13:02.279 --> 03:13:03.349 align:start position:0%
accept payment and actually issue
permits

03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
permits
 
03:13:05.809 --> 03:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
you have inspectors and the inspectors
 
03:13:07.969 --> 03:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
out there there's a varied you and their
 
03:13:09.710 --> 03:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
responsible responsible for the
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
compliance and investigations and
 
03:13:15.490 --> 03:13:15.500 align:start position:0%
anything basically that is code
 
03:13:18.110 --> 03:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory but you have building
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
electrical mechanical and plumbing
 
03:13:22.610 --> 03:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
inspectors you have fire inspectors uh
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
code enforcement housing inspectors and
 
03:13:26.269 --> 03:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
again Health officers
 
03:13:28.370 --> 03:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
well most people don't realize all of
 
03:13:30.170 --> 03:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
these roles it takes all of these roles
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
to be filled in order for a department
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
to operate and function you know
 
03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:37.250 align:start position:0%
to operate and function you know
successfully

03:13:37.250 --> 03:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
and in many of our communities many many
 
03:13:42.410 --> 03:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
of our communities
 
03:13:45.230 --> 03:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
these rules are all filled by one person
 
03:13:48.050 --> 03:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
so only will you find in the larger
 
03:13:49.849 --> 03:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
communities or the cities that there'll
 
03:13:51.650 --> 03:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
be individuals to fill each of these
 
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
positions so when you look into your
 
03:13:55.010 --> 03:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
smaller communities and when people talk
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
about in times it takes to get permits
 
03:13:59.690 --> 03:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
permit review and all of this it it does
 
03:14:00.889 --> 03:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
take some time in the smaller
 
03:14:02.030 --> 03:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
communities because it's one person
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
so building inspectors what do they
 
03:14:09.769 --> 03:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
really do right they're out there in the
 
03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
field looking at you know how is a
 
03:14:13.730 --> 03:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
building built how is it constructed how
 
03:14:15.650 --> 03:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
is it safe right so they start off with
 
03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
Foundation inspections then we get into
 
03:14:19.490 --> 03:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
what we call rough inspections which is
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
the building frame the electrical the
 
03:14:25.130 --> 03:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
plumbing we also get into part of the
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
frame is the first steps in the fire
 
03:14:29.210 --> 03:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
safety which is draft stopping and
 
03:14:29.220 --> 03:14:30.309 align:start position:0%
safety which is draft stopping and
insulation

03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
insulation
 
03:14:33.410 --> 03:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
and then we get into final inspections
 
03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
again building building inspections
 
03:14:37.790 --> 03:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
electrical Mechanical plumbing all those
 
03:14:39.530 --> 03:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
everything that you see once all the
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
walls are up and everything they do get
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
a final inspection to make sure that
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's compliant with code
 
03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
fire inspectors right they're
 
03:14:49.130 --> 03:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
responsible for all the Fire and Life
 
03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
safety compliance inspections of all
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
non-residential buildings they also get
 
03:14:55.969 --> 03:14:55.979 align:start position:0%
involved in the place of assembly
 
03:14:58.610 --> 03:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
inspections and permitting process for
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
those places of assembly regular school
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
daycare and Foster Care inspections and
 
03:15:06.349 --> 03:15:06.359 align:start position:0%
they are involved in Fire and Life
 
03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
safety compliance inspections of
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
non-residential and multi-family
 
03:15:12.349 --> 03:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
residentials when they receive
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
complaints that they need to follow up
 
03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:15.710 align:start position:0%
complaints that they need to follow up
on

03:15:15.710 --> 03:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:15:17.929 --> 03:15:17.939 align:start position:0%
our code enforcement and housing
 
03:15:17.939 --> 03:15:19.010 align:start position:0%
our code enforcement and housing
inspectors

03:15:19.010 --> 03:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
03:15:21.170 --> 03:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
they're involved with the code Code
 
03:15:24.170 --> 03:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
Compliance inspections of of all rental
 
03:15:26.690 --> 03:15:26.700 align:start position:0%
properties typically occasionally
 
03:15:28.490 --> 03:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
they'll get into some maintenance codes
 
03:15:30.230 --> 03:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
that involve single family but mostly
 
03:15:31.849 --> 03:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
they look into the housing standards
 
03:15:33.790 --> 03:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
that people rent
 
03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement of how they're involved with
 
03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of housing regulations
 
03:15:39.410 --> 03:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
and standards that are both locally
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
adopted and at the state level their
 
03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement of property and maintenance
 
03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
codes if the community has so adopted if
 
03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
you recall in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
it does not adopt a Statewide property
 
03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance code that is left specific
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
specifically in the law to the local
 
03:15:55.080 --> 03:15:56.570 align:start position:0%
specifically in the law to the local
communities

03:15:56.570 --> 03:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:15:58.190 --> 03:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
and then we have the enforcement of
 
03:16:00.290 --> 03:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
local land use regulations that code
 
03:16:02.570 --> 03:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
enforcements are also tasked with and
 
03:16:04.490 --> 03:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
then we have our Health Inspectors who
 
03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
they're involved in the compliance
 
03:16:08.090 --> 03:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
inspections of commercial food
 
03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
establishments and those could be at a
 
03:16:12.889 --> 03:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
specific time or as needed if there's a
 
03:16:15.230 --> 03:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
complaint licensing of all food
 
03:16:17.870 --> 03:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
establishments and that could be in many
 
03:16:20.450 --> 03:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
communities conducted by the state or in
 
03:16:21.889 --> 03:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
your larger communities that have a
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
health department they'll conduct those
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
Food Service licensing
 
03:16:27.889 --> 03:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
and then compliance inspections of
 
03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
residential rental buildings and again
 
03:16:32.809 --> 03:16:32.819 align:start position:0%
specific times that they may do that
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
they may do a regular inspection of
 
03:16:36.590 --> 03:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
rental properties or they may need to go
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
into those properties on an unannounced
 
03:16:41.570 --> 03:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
basis for an investigation and then they
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
also are responsible for the enforcement
 
03:16:45.769 --> 03:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
of all state and local health and
 
03:16:48.050 --> 03:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations that that can
 
03:16:49.969 --> 03:16:49.979 align:start position:0%
include Sometimes some of your storm
 
03:16:52.809 --> 03:16:52.819 align:start position:0%
water erosion Control ordinances
 
03:16:55.490 --> 03:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
so affordable housing
 
03:16:58.130 --> 03:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
many people ask you know does do the
 
03:16:59.809 --> 03:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
building codes allow for affordable
 
03:17:01.610 --> 03:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
housing and the simple answer that is
 
03:17:04.429 --> 03:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
yes the building codes
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
allow for affordable housing because
 
03:17:08.269 --> 03:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
they allow for minimal standards that
 
03:17:11.090 --> 03:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
can be there so when a permit is needed
 
03:17:12.769 --> 03:17:12.779 align:start position:0%
it's any time you're doing you're
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
constructing a structure that's 200
 
03:17:18.469 --> 03:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
square foot or larger or is intended for
 
03:17:21.170 --> 03:17:21.180 align:start position:0%
for human occupancy
 
03:17:23.630 --> 03:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
so you can build smaller than 200 square
 
03:17:25.250 --> 03:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
feet in fact some of us has done the
 
03:17:27.110 --> 03:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
exercise and determined that somewhere
 
03:17:30.410 --> 03:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
around 170 square feet is adequate in
 
03:17:34.130 --> 03:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
order to provide housing that meets the
 
03:17:37.309 --> 03:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
code and and provides the three key
 
03:17:39.070 --> 03:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
elements and that is means to cook
 
03:17:41.570 --> 03:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
cleanse and sleep
 
03:17:44.330 --> 03:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
you can do that 170 square feet
 
03:17:47.330 --> 03:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
so tiny homes which are permitted by the
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
building for right now because the state
 
03:17:50.330 --> 03:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire through recommendation
 
03:17:52.130 --> 03:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board has
 
03:17:55.190 --> 03:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
adopted appendix Q and A tiny home is
 
03:17:57.410 --> 03:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
anything that is 400 square foot or less
 
03:17:59.809 --> 03:17:59.819 align:start position:0%
and is not on Wheels by the building
 
03:18:02.090 --> 03:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
code once we get into Wheels it's a
 
03:18:03.830 --> 03:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
whole different world the building code
 
03:18:06.650 --> 03:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
requires a tiny home or any home to be
 
03:18:09.889 --> 03:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.110 --> 03:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
the building code also allows structures
 
03:18:13.969 --> 03:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
to be built as close as three feet to
 
03:18:15.889 --> 03:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
the property lines this is something
 
03:18:17.389 --> 03:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
that catches people by surprise because
 
03:18:20.090 --> 03:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
they're so used to 15 foot 30 foot 45
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
foot setbacks the building code is not
 
03:18:24.050 --> 03:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
working that way they work on a three
 
03:18:25.969 --> 03:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
foot setback but there's specific
 
03:18:27.710 --> 03:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
requirements as far as you may have to
 
03:18:29.690 --> 03:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
fire rate the side of the building you
 
03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
may have to limit Windows on that side
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
of the building just so that we don't
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
get fire spreading building to building
 
03:18:36.410 --> 03:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
and then there's varied construction
 
03:18:38.830 --> 03:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
methods and materials that can be used
 
03:18:42.170 --> 03:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
out there now and I think it really is
 
03:18:44.990 --> 03:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
up to the the Builder or the developer
 
03:18:47.990 --> 03:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
to determine what's most economically
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
feasible for them to construct the homes
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
your barriers I truly think come into
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
when we start looking into land use law
 
03:18:59.450 --> 03:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
and when we start looking at property
 
03:19:02.650 --> 03:19:02.660 align:start position:0%
line setbacks lot sizes density
 
03:19:06.110 --> 03:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
architectural design standards and often
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
in many of our communities very outdated
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
ordinances you know you'll look in some
 
03:19:12.889 --> 03:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
of our communities the the ordinance may
 
03:19:15.889 --> 03:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
have developed in the 1960s or 70s and
 
03:19:17.630 --> 03:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
nobody's really brushed that brushed
 
03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
them over and and cleaned them up so
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
that they they address current issues
 
03:19:24.479 --> 03:19:26.210 align:start position:0%
that they they address current issues
um

03:19:26.210 --> 03:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:29.210 --> 03:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
so from our Viewpoint from the nhboa how
 
03:19:31.490 --> 03:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
can legislators help right we think it's
 
03:19:33.050 --> 03:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
important that the legislature is
 
03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the important roles that
 
03:19:35.340 --> 03:19:36.190 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the important roles that
codes

03:19:36.190 --> 03:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
codes
 
03:19:38.929 --> 03:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
play in New Hampshire as far as making
 
03:19:41.690 --> 03:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
the homes and places we work safe for
 
03:19:41.700 --> 03:19:43.610 align:start position:0%
the homes and places we work safe for
everyone

03:19:43.610 --> 03:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we support the updated codes that
 
03:19:47.809 --> 03:19:47.819 align:start position:0%
recognizes advances in the product
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
Industries and the changing needs for
 
03:19:51.170 --> 03:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:19:54.110 --> 03:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
if the codes don't specifically do
 
03:19:56.690 --> 03:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
what we need there is an amendment
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
process that we can work through with
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and it
 
03:20:02.210 --> 03:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
works very well
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
this is a key one for me is that there's
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
legislators please follow the
 
03:20:08.570 --> 03:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
established processes for code adoption
 
03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
codes shouldn't be through legislation
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
they should be through the processes of
 
03:20:14.929 --> 03:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
the building code review board if the
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
codes aren't working correctly for us we
 
03:20:18.230 --> 03:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
should look at the amendment process
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
through the building code review board
 
03:20:22.610 --> 03:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
often we find that we try to amend
 
03:20:23.990 --> 03:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes through
 
03:20:26.330 --> 03:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
legislation and that may work great for
 
03:20:28.429 --> 03:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
the first few years but codes change so
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
much and needs change so much and it's
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
very difficult to get that out of
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
legislation once it's in there and that
 
03:20:36.710 --> 03:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
becomes a hindrance to us
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
and then work with established
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
organizations to address concerns and
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
what we deem as barriers is the building
 
03:20:43.969 --> 03:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
code review board New Hampshire building
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%

Human Services and New Hampshire Des we
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
all work very closely together we
 
03:20:56.690 --> 03:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
communicate with each other and when we
 
03:20:58.730 --> 03:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
when any one of us finds that there's an
 
03:21:01.250 --> 03:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
area that's of concern to our
 
03:21:03.710 --> 03:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislators we we like to address it and
 
03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
we do communicate
 
03:21:10.550 --> 03:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
so with that I will yield and take any
 
03:21:12.590 --> 03:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you'd like and I'll do my
 
03:21:14.030 --> 03:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
best to answer them
 
03:21:15.889 --> 03:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr McKinney that's been
 
03:21:18.230 --> 03:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
helpful um I'm gonna open it up
 
03:21:21.889 --> 03:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
um representative Reed go ahead
 
03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your presentation
 
03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
um so this was a question I had earlier
 
03:21:29.690 --> 03:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
and was told to wait for the expert and
 
03:21:31.130 --> 03:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's you
 
03:21:31.140 --> 03:21:32.809 align:start position:0%
that's you
um

03:21:32.809 --> 03:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:34.849 --> 03:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
we had had a presentation a few weeks
 
03:21:38.269 --> 03:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
ago that talked about how a lot of our
 
03:21:40.730 --> 03:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
ordinances I mean originally the idea in
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court ruled that this was
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
these ordinances were allowed because of
 
03:21:46.910 --> 03:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
the basic health safety and Welfare and
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
how that has suffered from Mission creep
 
03:21:51.650 --> 03:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
over the many decades and in many cases
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
some of these ordinances are more
 
03:21:56.090 --> 03:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
arbitrary or more just kind of what
 
03:21:57.950 --> 03:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
people would like to see rather than
 
03:22:00.170 --> 03:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
basically protecting health safety and
 
03:22:02.570 --> 03:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
Welfare and so one of these applications
 
03:22:05.330 --> 03:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
we were talking about before you showed
 
03:22:09.530 --> 03:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
up was a lot minimum requirements and
 
03:22:11.769 --> 03:22:11.779 align:start position:0%
how can we
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
tie back to health safety and Welfare
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we started to get into a
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
conversation about well you know
 
03:22:19.730 --> 03:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
basically it really is going to come
 
03:22:22.790 --> 03:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
down to to water and septic for a lot of
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
these areas and then of course that'll
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
depend on the the soil type and whatever
 
03:22:29.690 --> 03:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
and how we can connect that and
 
03:22:29.700 --> 03:22:31.210 align:start position:0%
and how we can connect that and
basically

03:22:31.210 --> 03:22:31.220 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:22:33.469 --> 03:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
what what do you think of that is
 
03:22:36.290 --> 03:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
essentially the question so like do you
 
03:22:40.130 --> 03:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
have a sense of for certain soil types A
 
03:22:41.929 --> 03:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
Certain minimum size would be required
 
03:22:43.969 --> 03:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
for septic because we have communities
 
03:22:48.170 --> 03:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
that have 20 acre lot minimums in New
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I don't think any of us
 
03:22:51.769 --> 03:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
can be convinced that you need 20 acres
 
03:22:55.190 --> 03:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
for a septic personally I think soil
 
03:22:58.250 --> 03:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
based zoning is is outdated and and
 
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
really needs to be looked seriously at
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I believe if you
 
03:23:07.490 --> 03:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
look at some court cases that may be out
 
03:23:08.990 --> 03:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
there it's been following the soil based
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
zoning is is overly restrictive and
 
03:23:13.849 --> 03:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
that's because of the advances that have
 
03:23:17.570 --> 03:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
been made in in subsurface systems you
 
03:23:18.769 --> 03:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire Des can probably
 
03:23:20.929 --> 03:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
speak much better to that for for me
 
03:23:23.210 --> 03:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
than a subsurface bill but you can
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
certainly put in a a much smaller septic
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
system now that does the same job that
 
03:23:32.570 --> 03:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
we did in the 1960s
 
03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
um so I think soil based
 
03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
zoning is overly restrictive in my view
 
03:23:40.969 --> 03:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
as a code official and because of
 
03:23:43.370 --> 03:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
because it does require the larger Lots
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's where you start getting into your
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
reduced density that's permitted no some
 
03:23:49.969 --> 03:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
people appreciate the reduced density in
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire character but if
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
you're looking at affordable housing
 
03:23:56.450 --> 03:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
maybe some some better
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
planning designs of you know areas for
 
03:24:01.130 --> 03:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
affordable housing that you could work
 
03:24:04.190 --> 03:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
that and and increase the density put in
 
03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
newer dated septid systems and be able
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
to provide more housing that
 
03:24:14.210 --> 03:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:17.809 --> 03:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
and not to to pin you down but can you
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
just throw a number out there for like a
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
lot size minimum that would be
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable for today's technology
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
for today's technology a quarter a
 
03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey
 
03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Alexander and
 
03:24:39.490 --> 03:24:39.500 align:start position:0%
Christopher Kay thank you for being here
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
you had two items you spoke of that
 
03:24:44.570 --> 03:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
sparked my interest
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
when you spoke of
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
codes and appendix q and tiny homes and
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
I fully understand wheels are not wheels
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and you talked about that with good
 
03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
building practices the buildings could
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
be within three feet to a property line
 
03:25:05.279 --> 03:25:06.050 align:start position:0%
be within three feet to a property line
um

03:25:06.050 --> 03:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:09.050 --> 03:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
question one is that accepted by most
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
towns and does that does that tell me
 
03:25:16.250 --> 03:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
then that a six foot separation
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
on on a property between buildings with
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
the proper building codes and access for
 
03:25:26.510 --> 03:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:28.429 --> 03:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
excellent questions representative
 
03:25:32.450 --> 03:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
McConkey and um yes the the separation
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
could be reduced to as much as six feet
 
03:25:37.370 --> 03:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
provided you're you know and in some
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
cases that may require residential
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems to be to be provided
 
03:25:45.229 --> 03:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
um rated siding you know fire resistive
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
siding uh limitation of what they call
 
03:25:49.130 --> 03:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
limitation of openings so windows and
 
03:25:50.809 --> 03:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
doors couldn't be constructed on the
 
03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
sides of those buildings but and again
 
03:25:55.550 --> 03:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
but if you move out to five feet from
 
03:25:57.050 --> 03:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
property line and provide the 10 foot
 
03:26:00.530 --> 03:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:02.809 --> 03:26:02.819 align:start position:0%
um allow more openings we don't get into
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
the fire rated siding and I think so and
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
a follow-up we had a presentation a
 
03:26:12.710 --> 03:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
couple weeks back talking about what's
 
03:26:15.410 --> 03:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
happening in the country and I guess
 
03:26:17.990 --> 03:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
Seattle is leading in a couple other
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
states are talking about permitting
 
03:26:22.969 --> 03:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
single stair buildings
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
are you familiar whether we have started
 
03:26:28.670 --> 03:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
that conversation in our state
 
03:26:32.090 --> 03:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
would that be for multi-family uh no we
 
03:26:34.190 --> 03:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
have not started that conversation in
 
03:26:36.650 --> 03:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
our state and I don't know
 
03:26:39.769 --> 03:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
the codes are updated nationally every
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
three years
 
03:26:43.190 --> 03:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if that's in the
 
03:26:48.290 --> 03:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
code for the 2024 or 2027 editions
 
03:26:48.300 --> 03:26:49.250 align:start position:0%
code for the 2024 or 2027 editions
um

03:26:49.250 --> 03:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
but it's you know if if it comes to the
 
03:26:53.570 --> 03:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
code and again if it's something that
 
03:26:56.330 --> 03:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
the legislature would really like to see
 
03:26:58.190 --> 03:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
a proposal to the building code review
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
board starts that conversation and they
 
03:27:01.969 --> 03:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
can amend the current code that we're
 
03:27:03.889 --> 03:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
under to address that
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
and if I could if the legislature
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
thought you know that this was a good
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
idea and they were asking in your I
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
understood that you told me it'd be nice
 
03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
to go through your process as post-dos
 
03:27:16.200 --> 03:27:17.990 align:start position:0%
to go through your process as post-dos
legislating

03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislating
 
03:27:21.469 --> 03:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
can can can a request be made for a
 
03:27:24.650 --> 03:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
single item like that as opposed to if
 
03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
the if the legislature were asked they
 
03:27:29.809 --> 03:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
thought this was a great idea that we
 
03:27:31.969 --> 03:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to take every all the
 
03:27:34.130 --> 03:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
other baggage that comes with that would
 
03:27:36.410 --> 03:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
you consider a single item or would the
 
03:27:39.769 --> 03:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
code state code accept just a single
 
03:27:42.050 --> 03:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
item in your review the building code
 
03:27:44.210 --> 03:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
review review board would review any
 
03:27:46.250 --> 03:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's proposed to them and
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's compliant and and
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
provides the you know the level of Life
 
03:27:53.090 --> 03:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
Safety uh the difficulty is you know
 
03:27:54.650 --> 03:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to maintain that level
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
of Life Safety that the codes offer
 
03:27:58.849 --> 03:27:58.859 align:start position:0%
originally and again if you're getting
 
03:28:01.030 --> 03:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
into single single stairwell buildings
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
you probably are already putting
 
03:28:04.429 --> 03:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems in the building
 
03:28:06.010 --> 03:28:06.020 align:start position:0%
because of the number of occupancies
 
03:28:09.170 --> 03:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
that do you really need the secondary
 
03:28:12.050 --> 03:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
means and that's the question and and I
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
know it's being asked around the country
 
03:28:15.710 --> 03:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so but it's absolutely the
 
03:28:18.110 --> 03:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
building code review board accepts and
 
03:28:20.990 --> 03:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
reviews uh single Amendment proposals
 
03:28:22.849 --> 03:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
all the time I appreciate your time sir
 
03:28:26.330 --> 03:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr representative Gibbs
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:31.250 --> 03:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
um just uh to be sure I I understood
 
03:28:33.050 --> 03:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and I have it clear
 
03:28:33.060 --> 03:28:34.010 align:start position:0%
um and I have it clear
um

03:28:34.010 --> 03:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
for a modern septic system a single acre
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
lot I'm sorry a quarter acre lot would
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
be reasonable
 
03:28:43.490 --> 03:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
I would have to look at that
 
03:28:45.769 --> 03:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
specifically as far as and I may have
 
03:28:48.050 --> 03:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
misspoke as far as the quarter raker um
 
03:28:49.849 --> 03:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
the lot size would still have to be
 
03:28:52.190 --> 03:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
determined you know through Des process
 
03:28:54.349 --> 03:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
and Des subsurface
 
03:28:55.849 --> 03:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
um if there's Municipal Water and
 
03:28:57.530 --> 03:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
they're doing septic a lot can be
 
03:28:59.389 --> 03:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
reduced but if they have a well and
 
03:29:01.309 --> 03:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
septic now that lot size starts to
 
03:29:02.990 --> 03:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
increase again because you have to have
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
the radius around the well the
 
03:29:06.050 --> 03:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
protective radius around the wellness
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
such so a quarter acre lot for all homes
 
03:29:11.090 --> 03:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
with septics I would say probably
 
03:29:11.100 --> 03:29:13.070 align:start position:0%
with septics I would say probably
unreasonable

03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
03:29:15.650 --> 03:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
because most of those would end up being
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
on private Wells also
 
03:29:24.110 --> 03:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
so between a quarter acre and what would
 
03:29:26.090 --> 03:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
be the larger
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
size that would seem reasonable and I'm
 
03:29:29.929 --> 03:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
not I'm not asking you for something
 
03:29:31.729 --> 03:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
that you know you're going to put up
 
03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
your hand and swear to I understand you
 
03:29:35.450 --> 03:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
can't do that just an estimate typically
 
03:29:37.490 --> 03:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
you're you're probably looking into the
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
three-quarter to one acre lot for
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
anything to include a septic system and
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
a private well
 
03:29:45.050 --> 03:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
so between a quarter acre just for a
 
03:29:47.330 --> 03:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
septic system and
 
03:29:51.290 --> 03:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
an acre if it was a septic system and an
 
03:29:54.170 --> 03:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes I I want to be cautious that again a
 
03:29:59.510 --> 03:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
lot plays into that if there's Wetlands
 
03:30:01.070 --> 03:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
on the property
 
03:30:03.830 --> 03:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
um there's setbacks from Wetlands so
 
03:30:06.290 --> 03:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
could you get all the way down to a
 
03:30:07.849 --> 03:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
quarter of acre a lot for a septic
 
03:30:09.950 --> 03:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
system possibly I'd have to see what the
 
03:30:11.870 --> 03:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
designs are and what technology allows
 
03:30:11.880 --> 03:30:13.190 align:start position:0%
designs are and what technology allows
now

03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:30:15.969 --> 03:30:15.979 align:start position:0%
um but again there's there's often other
 
03:30:18.769 --> 03:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
issues there ledge that doesn't permit
 
03:30:20.929 --> 03:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
for it uh again Wetlands that doesn't
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
permit for it uh well radiuses that
 
03:30:26.750 --> 03:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't permit for it so and each of
 
03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
those that you add in just starts to
 
03:30:28.439 --> 03:30:29.510 align:start position:0%
those that you add in just starts to
increase

03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:30:31.610 --> 03:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
the square footage that you'll need
 
03:30:34.910 --> 03:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of the system going in
 
03:30:38.150 --> 03:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
but would anything larger than one acre
 
03:30:44.690 --> 03:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:46.849 --> 03:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
with the systems that are available out
 
03:30:50.330 --> 03:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
there I I would say yes I mean one acre
 
03:30:53.690 --> 03:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
lots would be probably the the minimum
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
you'd the one you'd want to go
 
03:30:59.570 --> 03:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
and be safe but I
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
again I'm not asking you to put your
 
03:31:03.889 --> 03:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
hand up and swear to it and again I I
 
03:31:06.050 --> 03:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
gotta defer a lot to subsurface systems
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
to Des
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
they are much more knowledgeable on them
 
03:31:11.889 --> 03:31:11.899 align:start position:0%
than I am
 
03:31:14.030 --> 03:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of these are good questions I'll
 
03:31:15.769 --> 03:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
be reaching out to Des lots of good
 
03:31:17.570 --> 03:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
questions for that okay yeah thank you
 
03:31:17.580 --> 03:31:20.690 align:start position:0%
questions for that okay yeah thank you
super

03:31:20.690 --> 03:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:22.849 --> 03:31:22.859 align:start position:0%
it's all good representative
 
03:31:25.070 --> 03:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for uh taking the
 
03:31:28.130 --> 03:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
questions you said that soil based
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
zoning is Antiquated
 
03:31:35.570 --> 03:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
um what what type of zoning do you think
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
is not Antiquated is you know
 
03:31:42.170 --> 03:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
what what if you're trying to base
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
something on some facts on the ground
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
and say like this is what you need to
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
consider to consider to say the the size
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
of the lot that will be required what
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
other than zoning would you take in or
 
03:32:00.290 --> 03:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh what other than local soil
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
like the soil on that property would you
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
be considering I think those lots really
 
03:32:06.889 --> 03:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
need to be determined upon you know the
 
03:32:09.050 --> 03:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
type of subsurface system that you'd be
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
putting in there your oil radius
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
requirements um you know again setbacks
 
03:32:16.190 --> 03:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
again we want to be we have minimum
 
03:32:18.170 --> 03:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
setbacks in the code
 
03:32:18.180 --> 03:32:18.729 align:start position:0%
setbacks in the code
um

03:32:18.729 --> 03:32:18.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:21.590 --> 03:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
but to strictly look at a soil-based
 
03:32:23.389 --> 03:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
zoning and saying because you know I
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
have this type of soil it's a minimum
 
03:32:28.130 --> 03:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
two acre lot or a five acre lot when
 
03:32:30.290 --> 03:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
there are there are other options that
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
are out there now you know when those
 
03:32:34.849 --> 03:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
are windows zoning regulations came in
 
03:32:37.010 --> 03:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
it was pretty much only one septic
 
03:32:39.530 --> 03:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
design one or two septic Design Systems
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
are that were acceptable
 
03:32:42.769 --> 03:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
there have been plenty there's been
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
advances in that field so I think that
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
that allows for some reduced lot sizes
 
03:32:53.150 --> 03:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.450 --> 03:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for for uh that have you
 
03:33:02.210 --> 03:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
um in your experience with Des have have
 
03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
they kind of
 
03:33:03.960 --> 03:33:04.729 align:start position:0%
they kind of
um

03:33:04.729 --> 03:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:06.290 --> 03:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
do you think that they're up to date
 
03:33:06.300 --> 03:33:07.429 align:start position:0%
do you think that they're up to date
about

03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:33:07.439 --> 03:33:08.469 align:start position:0%
about
um

03:33:08.469 --> 03:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:11.929 --> 03:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
being responsive to the technology
 
03:33:14.690 --> 03:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
versus the soil type and saying like or
 
03:33:18.050 --> 03:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
are they much more uh rigid as far as
 
03:33:18.060 --> 03:33:19.070 align:start position:0%
are they much more uh rigid as far as
like

03:33:19.070 --> 03:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:33:21.710 --> 03:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
um basing everything on like the worst
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
type of of uh
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know historically built type of
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
system and saying this is worst case
 
03:33:31.849 --> 03:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
scenario or they or you know are they
 
03:33:34.250 --> 03:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
taking into account like hey you might
 
03:33:37.490 --> 03:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
have this new new process that doesn't
 
03:33:39.650 --> 03:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
take up as much room and so we're going
 
03:33:42.650 --> 03:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
to allow that type of um
 
03:33:46.969 --> 03:33:46.979 align:start position:0%
a system with a smaller radius or what
 
03:33:48.349 --> 03:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
what have you
 
03:33:51.469 --> 03:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
I can't speak specifically for Des
 
03:33:52.849 --> 03:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
um but I who would be the barrier yeah
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me who would be the barrier if
 
03:33:57.769 --> 03:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.010 --> 03:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
who would be the the barrier yeah to say
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
that hey this is not allowed even though
 
03:34:04.010 --> 03:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's a new
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
type of system
 
03:34:08.690 --> 03:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
Des would be the department that would
 
03:34:10.849 --> 03:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
look at whatever system is proposed but
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
I've you know in the Years doing this I
 
03:34:14.090 --> 03:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
found them pretty reasonable to
 
03:34:20.809 --> 03:34:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:21.950 --> 03:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
um represent McConkey then
 
03:34:23.690 --> 03:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh thank you Mr
 
03:34:27.410 --> 03:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
chairman of just to my my field is
 
03:34:29.630 --> 03:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
septic and design and all that sort of
 
03:34:32.090 --> 03:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
thing I've been added 30 years
 
03:34:34.010 --> 03:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
um the Department of Environmental
 
03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
Services subsurface
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
is the most reasonable part of that
 
03:34:41.630 --> 03:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
group to work with
 
03:34:45.050 --> 03:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
there there's a there is a division that
 
03:34:47.950 --> 03:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh that is uh Innovative technology
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
companies are always uh providing
 
03:34:53.389 --> 03:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
information to show how their product
 
03:34:56.510 --> 03:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
works and during the subdivision process
 
03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
you go through those those soils and
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
well calculation so I I think it would
 
03:35:05.690 --> 03:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
be fabulous to bring in someone like a
 
03:35:07.610 --> 03:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
Don Bucher from the Department who's
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
high up in that who deals with this
 
03:35:12.050 --> 03:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
every day of the week we can answer a
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
lot of your questions a quarter acre lot
 
03:35:16.250 --> 03:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
that is grandfathered prior to
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
subdivision is by right allowed to have
 
03:35:22.190 --> 03:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
a two-bedroom septic eye that helps
 
03:35:23.570 --> 03:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
answer your question that doesn't mean
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
every Puerto Rico lot is that good but
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
you have a grandfathered right so thank
 
03:35:29.809 --> 03:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
you representative um I have a question
 
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
before representative
 
03:35:31.920 --> 03:35:32.570 align:start position:0%
before representative
um

03:35:32.570 --> 03:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
my question I actually have two of them
 
03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
so can you talk a little bit about
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
leniency in the code like is there any
 
03:35:42.650 --> 03:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
what does it look like can you get sorry
 
03:35:45.490 --> 03:35:45.500 align:start position:0%
the the the what code representative
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
leniency in the code is there any
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
um maybe can you give me an anecdote
 
03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
about it um when you've used it
 
03:35:56.929 --> 03:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
um number one and I'll hold my other
 
03:35:56.939 --> 03:35:58.070 align:start position:0%
um number one and I'll hold my other
question

03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:36:00.650 --> 03:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
there is room you know the codes are
 
03:36:02.690 --> 03:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
very well designed and there is room for
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
a code official to make the time you
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
know decisions based upon
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
um technical information they can back
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
it up you you can use products that
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
aren't specifically cited in the code
 
03:36:15.410 --> 03:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
and is a section that addresses that
 
03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
quite well
 
03:36:19.190 --> 03:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and it's in an area it's called
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
alternative methods and materials that
 
03:36:23.929 --> 03:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
is in the code
 
03:36:26.690 --> 03:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
um I I find in
 
03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of code officials don't like to go
 
03:36:30.349 --> 03:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
that area because of the concern of
 
03:36:30.359 --> 03:36:32.030 align:start position:0%
that area because of the concern of
liability

03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
liability
 
03:36:33.650 --> 03:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
um but it's in the code and as long as
 
03:36:35.929 --> 03:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
you can back it up with um some some
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
data or testing information why you made
 
03:36:40.250 --> 03:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
that why you made the decision that you
 
03:36:40.260 --> 03:36:41.389 align:start position:0%
that why you made the decision that you
did

03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:36:43.729 --> 03:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
um I think everyone is fine with that so
 
03:36:45.769 --> 03:36:45.779 align:start position:0%
would you would you say that there's a
 
03:36:45.779 --> 03:36:47.450 align:start position:0%
would you would you say that there's a
concern

03:36:47.450 --> 03:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
there may or may not be more leniency if
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
the liability
 
03:36:54.170 --> 03:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
is this word
 
03:36:56.570 --> 03:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
the way Society is now everybody gets
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
more concerned with liability than we
 
03:37:00.530 --> 03:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
did a few years ago so it's just a
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
matter of making sure that you can back
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
up your decisions much better than you
 
03:37:05.450 --> 03:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
did in past
 
03:37:08.450 --> 03:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
um as far as leniency in the code
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's that type of leniency but there
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
is also a section in the code that says
 
03:37:14.870 --> 03:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
no code official has the ability to
 
03:37:18.410 --> 03:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
waive specific requirements of the code
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have to be careful of that that we're
 
03:37:21.889 --> 03:37:21.899 align:start position:0%
not waiving the requirement we're
 
03:37:24.410 --> 03:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
determining that this requirement is
 
03:37:26.090 --> 03:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
just as good as what the code requires
 
03:37:28.250 --> 03:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
and this is why and we do have the
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
ability to do that okay and my second
 
03:37:34.969 --> 03:37:34.979 align:start position:0%
question is um you seem to
 
03:37:36.889 --> 03:37:36.899 align:start position:0%
say during your presentation that there
 
03:37:39.769 --> 03:37:39.779 align:start position:0%
are times when these building ordinances
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
and codes haven't been looked at for
 
03:37:42.410 --> 03:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
years and years and years and that
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're you know they come up every so
 
03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:46.070 align:start position:0%
they're you know they come up every so
often

03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
often
 
03:37:47.809 --> 03:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
how would you feel about some language
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
saying that a municipality needs like
 
03:37:52.010 --> 03:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
should revisit their code every certain
 
03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
amount of years to
 
03:37:56.929 --> 03:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
I how often it how often do you find an
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
Antiquated code that somebody would use
 
03:38:01.429 --> 03:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
for a reason to deny
 
03:38:04.010 --> 03:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
a development I think more time in that
 
03:38:05.809 --> 03:38:05.819 align:start position:0%
that's only that's over into a local
 
03:38:08.269 --> 03:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
community's uh you know land use and
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations that you know and you
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
know having been on a planning before
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
and shared a planning board before and
 
03:38:17.210 --> 03:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
going through an updating zoning
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
regulations it's a very time consuming
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
process and because some of these
 
03:38:23.809 --> 03:38:23.819 align:start position:0%
regulations have been around for decades
 
03:38:26.450 --> 03:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
in some of these communities it often re
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
means that they're into hiring you know
 
03:38:30.290 --> 03:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
professional Consultants to do that
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
which is an expense to the community as
 
03:38:35.690 --> 03:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
well and it's why it may often not be
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
done because to do it at a at a
 
03:38:40.250 --> 03:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
volunteer level it can be you know
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
pretty involved and very time consuming
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
for the volunteers to do uh
 
03:38:47.809 --> 03:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
but you know as far as the building and
 
03:38:49.969 --> 03:38:49.979 align:start position:0%
fire codes the building of fire codes
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
are you know again a new code Edition
 
03:38:55.250 --> 03:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
comes out every three years our building
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
code review looks at it and either
 
03:38:58.610 --> 03:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
recommends to move forward with an
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
updated building of fire code or or or
 
03:39:03.769 --> 03:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
amend that voting and fire code and move
 
03:39:05.650 --> 03:39:05.660 align:start position:0%
it forward so
 
03:39:08.150 --> 03:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
where we really sit
 
03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
when we may be outdated is is local land
 
03:39:16.250 --> 03:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think my question was
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
probably getting towards the same point
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the cheers question but I think I
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
might be thinking of it from a different
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
angle am I incorrect in my understanding
 
03:39:27.840 --> 03:39:29.450 align:start position:0%
angle am I incorrect in my understanding
that

03:39:29.450 --> 03:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:33.710 --> 03:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
the the barrier is the municipality so
 
03:39:36.290 --> 03:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
whilst so let me just give an example
 
03:39:38.990 --> 03:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
let's say municipality has said in this
 
03:39:40.969 --> 03:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
area because of the technology that
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
existed whenever they put this forward
 
03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh the lot minimum is five acres and
 
03:39:49.190 --> 03:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's what the septic systems needed or
 
03:39:51.290 --> 03:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
maybe they didn't quite need five acres
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
but that's what they set forth so now
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
you have somebody who has five acres and
 
03:39:57.710 --> 03:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
they replace their septic system with
 
03:39:59.210 --> 03:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
the new technology
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
and they go to the town and go can I
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
further develop now because I have this
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
technology and the town's going to say
 
03:40:08.990 --> 03:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
likely no in my am I correct that that
 
03:40:11.809 --> 03:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
is really the barrier in this and not so
 
03:40:13.490 --> 03:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
much the underlying code
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
I I believe so yeah yes is that because
 
03:40:18.050 --> 03:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
because they have minimum lot size
 
03:40:20.210 --> 03:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
regulations it may or may not be
 
03:40:22.250 --> 03:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
outdated and again it could be preferred
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
by the community but you know we I think
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
we can prove that you can have reduced
 
03:40:29.870 --> 03:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
lot sizes through improved technologies
 
03:40:31.090 --> 03:40:31.100 align:start position:0%
that are available
 
03:40:33.410 --> 03:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
whether it's a subsurface barrels
 
03:40:34.610 --> 03:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
whether it's the the construction
 
03:40:34.620 --> 03:40:36.190 align:start position:0%
whether it's the the construction
materials

03:40:36.190 --> 03:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
materials
 
03:40:38.690 --> 03:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
that you can reduce some of those lot
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
sizes it's probably not something a lot
 
03:40:42.650 --> 03:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
of people in the state want to hear you
 
03:40:45.410 --> 03:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
know we we like the rural character of
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:40:49.370 --> 03:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
um but you know I I think it's important
 
03:40:51.290 --> 03:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
to really look into as we said when we
 
03:40:53.389 --> 03:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
put everything into the codes what
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
really is preventing
 
03:40:56.640 --> 03:40:58.309 align:start position:0%
really is preventing
um

03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
more use of land
 
03:41:02.690 --> 03:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
okay representative Kellen
 
03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
I would so when you were talking about
 
03:41:13.849 --> 03:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
these um building uh a safe home as
 
03:41:18.170 --> 03:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
small as 170 square feet that complies
 
03:41:19.969 --> 03:41:19.979 align:start position:0%
with the code
 
03:41:22.670 --> 03:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
um are these like exercises that your
 
03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
group did or is it a published like
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
study using this type of
 
03:41:31.130 --> 03:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
um like these type of methods that you
 
03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
can achieve this type of of because I
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
think that might be
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
um a valuable resource to someone that's
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
trying to build affordably that say
 
03:41:42.769 --> 03:41:42.779 align:start position:0%
these are the methods maybe to to use to
 
03:41:46.370 --> 03:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
be able to get to this home being safe
 
03:41:50.450 --> 03:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
and you know utilize like are you using
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know a bathroom and uh you know how
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
are you constructing that to make that
 
03:41:56.520 --> 03:41:58.130 align:start position:0%
are you constructing that to make that
work

03:41:58.130 --> 03:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:42:00.290 --> 03:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
um you know solving that for some people
 
03:42:02.690 --> 03:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
so that they don't have to do um do the
 
03:42:03.889 --> 03:42:03.899 align:start position:0%
work again
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
um that would be interesting if that was
 
03:42:07.130 --> 03:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
published I don't know if you if you
 
03:42:07.140 --> 03:42:08.030 align:start position:0%
published I don't know if you if you
know

03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:42:11.590 --> 03:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
um if it is and then also kind of like
 
03:42:16.130 --> 03:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
what the cost of that building was if if
 
03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
you could build a 200 square foot home
 
03:42:20.809 --> 03:42:20.819 align:start position:0%
that houses someone
 
03:42:24.290 --> 03:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
um you know in addition to kind of the
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
layout what is the cost of that
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
structure of the building materials of
 
03:42:30.290 --> 03:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
that structure so that I think the the
 
03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
that the public and the committee would
 
03:42:35.690 --> 03:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
want to know like what is the POS like
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
the cheapest homes that could be safely
 
03:42:42.650 --> 03:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
built and so that we have a range of of
 
03:42:45.290 --> 03:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
of understanding about like what if if
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to reach affordable what is
 
03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
the best case scenario Target for us it
 
03:42:52.910 --> 03:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
is a hundred thousand dollar home
 
03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:54.769 align:start position:0%
is a hundred thousand dollar home
possible

03:42:54.769 --> 03:42:54.779 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:42:58.190 --> 03:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
in this you know if you know best case
 
03:42:58.200 --> 03:42:59.690 align:start position:0%
in this you know if you know best case
scenario

03:42:59.690 --> 03:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
03:43:02.809 --> 03:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
um or are we shooting for 250 000 as a
 
03:43:04.610 --> 03:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
as a best case scenario I think that
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
would be helpful you know for the public
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
and this committee
 
03:43:09.950 --> 03:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments on all
 
03:43:11.450 --> 03:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
Excellence questions thank you and
 
03:43:14.090 --> 03:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
hopefully I address all of them uh no
 
03:43:16.490 --> 03:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
the the quick study that we did with the
 
03:43:18.110 --> 03:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
building officials Association come to
 
03:43:21.290 --> 03:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
170 square feet was just done between a
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
few building officials of saying hey
 
03:43:24.290 --> 03:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
what is the code allow and so that takes
 
03:43:26.030 --> 03:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
into account that you know there's
 
03:43:28.610 --> 03:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
specific clearance requirements for any
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
of your uh bathroom fixtures you know
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
the water closets the vanities the
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
showers they have to has to be
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
clearances around those so when you
 
03:43:38.450 --> 03:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
calculate in those clearances you you
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
end up in the area that okay this is the
 
03:43:42.070 --> 03:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
size that a bathroom would have to be
 
03:43:44.570 --> 03:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
then we get into can we provide the
 
03:43:46.429 --> 03:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
kitchen how big how big do you really
 
03:43:47.809 --> 03:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
need for a kitchen you know right you
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
have to you have to you know allow for
 
03:43:51.769 --> 03:43:51.779 align:start position:0%
your appliances do you need a dishwasher
 
03:43:53.330 --> 03:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
no I don't need a dishwasher I don't
 
03:43:55.370 --> 03:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
have to have a dishwasher right so you
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
start to take all of that out and you
 
03:43:59.570 --> 03:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
get down to the very bare minimum of
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
what what you need in order to construct
 
03:44:05.090 --> 03:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
that now is that going to house a family
 
03:44:07.729 --> 03:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
of three no no it's absolutely not
 
03:44:10.370 --> 03:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
you're looking at one of true people at
 
03:44:12.410 --> 03:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
that size and then as your needs
 
03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
increase the size of the building will
 
03:44:17.150 --> 03:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
need to increase but even still when you
 
03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
look at if you can get down to that 200
 
03:44:22.490 --> 03:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
square foot 170 square foot
 
03:44:25.790 --> 03:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
um uh building it comes down to your
 
03:44:27.410 --> 03:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
land use costs
 
03:44:29.690 --> 03:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
your development costs you know is is
 
03:44:31.010 --> 03:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
where you're planning to put this
 
03:44:32.990 --> 03:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
building is there a ledge that you have
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
to deal with trying to get a foundation
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
in it are you going to put it put a full
 
03:44:38.090 --> 03:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
Foundation under it or are you going to
 
03:44:40.130 --> 03:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
do a slab type Foundation which again
 
03:44:42.170 --> 03:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
that reduces cost because we don't have
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
to go down the full fourth the full uh
 
03:44:48.410 --> 03:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
eight feet to get a a basement in right
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and so there's all of that
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
development cost and then you also have
 
03:44:53.450 --> 03:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
to figure in if you have
 
03:44:55.490 --> 03:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
five acre zoning
 
03:44:59.150 --> 03:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
will a lender lend on a 200 square foot
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
home on a five acre lot probably not
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
because the numbers don't work very well
 
03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
as far as the value of the home to the
 
03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead I think I caught them
 
03:45:15.530 --> 03:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I was more I was more focused
 
03:45:18.590 --> 03:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
on the actual uh the cost of the actual
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
sticks in the building not not so much
 
03:45:23.210 --> 03:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
the other intangible or the other
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
tangible things including you know the
 
03:45:27.889 --> 03:45:27.899 align:start position:0%
specific State site costs and all of
 
03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
that stuff
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
um just the actual building
 
03:45:34.729 --> 03:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm also wondering
 
03:45:34.739 --> 03:45:36.710 align:start position:0%
um I'm also wondering
um

03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:39.229 --> 03:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
um we talked about or
 
03:45:41.570 --> 03:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
at a at a conference that I went to
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
about housing they talked about off-site
 
03:45:46.309 --> 03:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
building of
 
03:45:48.889 --> 03:45:48.899 align:start position:0%
um wall structures
 
03:45:51.769 --> 03:45:51.779 align:start position:0%
um or entire buildings maybe 3D printed
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
off-site and then shipped in
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
um not not the traditional modular homes
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
but how does how does our current code
 
03:46:06.050 --> 03:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
handling that like say a completely
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
built uh
 
03:46:11.809 --> 03:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
well structure that's just assembled on
 
03:46:15.410 --> 03:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
property here they seem to have some
 
03:46:18.170 --> 03:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
concerns about the building officials
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
wanting to kind of do a rough-in
 
03:46:22.309 --> 03:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
inspection on on a wall that's already
 
03:46:25.849 --> 03:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
you know has has uh has sheetrock on it
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
essentially right when it when it
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
arrives how is that handled if at all
 
03:46:34.610 --> 03:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:38.210 --> 03:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
the code is allowed for it's it's again
 
03:46:41.630 --> 03:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
in most of those cases there's oversight
 
03:46:43.450 --> 03:46:43.460 align:start position:0%
with those
 
03:46:46.490 --> 03:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
producers so somebody is looking at and
 
03:46:49.190 --> 03:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
doing quality control it may not just be
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
the building official
 
03:46:50.760 --> 03:46:52.490 align:start position:0%
the building official
so

03:46:52.490 --> 03:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:52.500 --> 03:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
having just completed you know or
 
03:46:58.190 --> 03:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
actually in the process of a large
 
03:47:01.550 --> 03:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
building in Nashua that is off-site
 
03:47:04.010 --> 03:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
constructed and brought in and the walls
 
03:47:05.450 --> 03:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
erected on site
 
03:47:07.370 --> 03:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
I actually prefer that type of
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
construction it's
 
03:47:13.309 --> 03:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
um very accurate and um so you don't you
 
03:47:14.570 --> 03:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
don't have the problems with over
 
03:47:16.969 --> 03:47:16.979 align:start position:0%
nailing or under nailing
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
um bad cuts that well
 
03:47:22.370 --> 03:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
it'll work good it's good enough
 
03:47:24.170 --> 03:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
um so when you do off-site construction
 
03:47:26.929 --> 03:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
and rely on the technology for it now
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
the product that you receive on site is
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to try to wrap this up so
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to represent my contact
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
represent Gibbs and then wrap it up
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
after that yep thank you Mr chairman
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
three quick questions
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
um overall code how many units apartment
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
units before you have to go to fire
 
03:47:50.809 --> 03:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
suppression is it three or four units
 
03:47:55.729 --> 03:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
three units or more okay and if
 
03:47:59.090 --> 03:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
if those apart I'm from the rural okay
 
03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
so Fire Chiefs love to throw in a
 
03:48:07.010 --> 03:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
cistern and depending on how large I
 
03:48:08.050 --> 03:48:08.060 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's the right term
 
03:48:11.889 --> 03:48:11.899 align:start position:0%
buried tank and excess for water
 
03:48:16.010 --> 03:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
if in your opinion or by code if someone
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
is already using fire suppression in
 
03:48:21.050 --> 03:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
their units
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
should that negate the need of then
 
03:48:25.969 --> 03:48:25.979 align:start position:0%
having to bring in cisterns on top of
 
03:48:25.979 --> 03:48:26.990 align:start position:0%
having to bring in cisterns on top of
that

03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
I have some fire chiefs that are
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:35.150 --> 03:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the fire code is
 
03:48:38.809 --> 03:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
that a water
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
protection has to be provided and it's
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
up to the local Authority having
 
03:48:46.010 --> 03:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to determine what that
 
03:48:48.170 --> 03:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
would be and if you recall several years
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
ago the state actually put into statute
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
that you know you can't mandate
 
03:48:55.250 --> 03:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems in one and two family
 
03:48:57.530 --> 03:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
but that is an alternative that's
 
03:49:00.050 --> 03:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
available to you in the cases and I have
 
03:49:01.910 --> 03:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
dealt with developments where because of
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
ledge it would have been very difficult
 
03:49:05.870 --> 03:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
to put cisterns and extremely expensive
 
03:49:09.229 --> 03:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
to put systems in so the developer said
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
will you accept putting sprinklers in in
 
03:49:14.030 --> 03:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
every home on the development and that
 
03:49:15.889 --> 03:49:15.899 align:start position:0%
was accepted by the fire chief in that
 
03:49:18.410 --> 03:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
community so there are options fire
 
03:49:20.570 --> 03:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
protection has to be provided in some
 
03:49:23.570 --> 03:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
form a pond uh you know underground
 
03:49:26.150 --> 03:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
tanks cisterns
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
um fire sprinkler systems if if and
 
03:49:32.210 --> 03:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
again I think that comes really down to
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
the developer to decide what makes the
 
03:49:37.250 --> 03:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
best economic sense to them to provide
 
03:49:38.809 --> 03:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
the fire protection that's required by
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
the fire code
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gibbs thank you
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
 
03:49:48.650 --> 03:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
um essentially individual cities and
 
03:49:50.330 --> 03:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
towns having their own building codes
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
but also that there are codes produced
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
by national organizations and updated
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
regularly and this is true in many areas
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
um uh for instance the Uniform
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code we were among the
 
03:50:10.070 --> 03:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee and we were working
 
03:50:13.729 --> 03:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
on adopting some recent changes to the
 
03:50:16.010 --> 03:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
Uniform Commercial Code and adopting
 
03:50:19.250 --> 03:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
them on a state basis and once they're
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
adopted on the state basis they apply
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that is each
 
03:50:26.750 --> 03:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
individual city or town doesn't have its
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
own Commercial Code applicable to the
 
03:50:32.809 --> 03:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
stores located in that city
 
03:50:36.050 --> 03:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
um similarly there are design standards
 
03:50:37.729 --> 03:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
um they're called ANSI standards
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
American National standards Institute
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
for accessible housing that kind of
 
03:50:44.510 --> 03:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
thing that was something that that I was
 
03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
professionally involved in
 
03:50:51.050 --> 03:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
um uh and so my question is would it be
 
03:50:51.060 --> 03:50:52.670 align:start position:0%
um uh and so my question is would it be
possible

03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:50:59.450 --> 03:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
um for the legislature to adopt uh a
 
03:51:03.530 --> 03:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
version of the building code that
 
03:51:07.190 --> 03:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
came from a National Organization
 
03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
include a provision for updating or
 
03:51:15.650 --> 03:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
amending it as necessary and have that
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
apply uh on a Statewide basis with some
 
03:51:23.929 --> 03:51:23.939 align:start position:0%
uh variability for local conditions
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:30.120 --> 03:51:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:51:31.190 --> 03:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have the
 
03:51:40.250 --> 03:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
option to set up arbitrary requirements
 
03:51:42.290 --> 03:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
as far as the State Building Code and
 
03:51:45.410 --> 03:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
state fire code those are now currently
 
03:51:48.710 --> 03:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
adopted under state law state statute
 
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
RSA 155 a is the state building code and
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
forgive me I forget the fire code is
 
03:51:59.170 --> 03:51:59.180 align:start position:0%
adopted through RSA 155a as well
 
03:52:02.570 --> 03:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
and those are reviewed
 
03:52:02.580 --> 03:52:03.410 align:start position:0%
and those are reviewed
um

03:52:03.410 --> 03:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:06.190 --> 03:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
currently now reviewed every three years
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
as the codes are update updated
 
03:52:11.690 --> 03:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
nationally we have a a bit of a
 
03:52:14.450 --> 03:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
there's language in the RSA that says we
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
cannot adopt a code that hasn't been at
 
03:52:17.990 --> 03:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
least in print for a minimum of three
 
03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
years so currently we're under the 2018
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
codes the latest edition code is out
 
03:52:28.190 --> 03:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
right now as the 2024s we'll be looking
 
03:52:31.190 --> 03:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
to move New Hampshire to the 2021s I
 
03:52:33.250 --> 03:52:33.260 align:start position:0%
believe within the next two years
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
so in how that statute is written is
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
that it's a Statewide code and it
 
03:52:41.450 --> 03:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
applies to all communities in the state
 
03:52:43.729 --> 03:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
but there is also a provision in there
 
03:52:46.370 --> 03:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
for each individual communities to
 
03:52:49.429 --> 03:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
provide more stringent provisions of the
 
03:52:53.889 --> 03:52:53.899 align:start position:0%
codes to address local needs so so
 
03:52:56.150 --> 03:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's great that we have a Statewide
 
03:52:56.160 --> 03:52:57.590 align:start position:0%
it's it's great that we have a Statewide
code

03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:52:57.600 --> 03:52:58.790 align:start position:0%
code
um

03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:00.590 --> 03:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
but you know the more astringent
 
03:53:02.090 --> 03:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
Provisions to address local needs
 
03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes causes some some heartburn
 
03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
around the state and the other issue we
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
really have in the state is right we
 
03:53:07.920 --> 03:53:09.670 align:start position:0%
really have in the state is right we
have

03:53:09.670 --> 03:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:53:14.090 --> 03:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
234 communities only about half of those
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
communities have adopted what they say a
 
03:53:20.929 --> 03:53:20.939 align:start position:0%
a code enforcement mechanism so and of
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
those half half of those communities
 
03:53:25.309 --> 03:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
probably less than half actually have
 
03:53:29.410 --> 03:53:29.420 align:start position:0%
full-time you know fully fully staffed
 
03:53:32.210 --> 03:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
offices for the build enforcement of our
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
administration of the building code so
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing is we say we have
 
03:53:39.769 --> 03:53:39.779 align:start position:0%
a Statewide code and everybody has to
 
03:53:41.210 --> 03:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
build to the code
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
but not every Community needs to have a
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
code official to enforce it
 
03:53:48.349 --> 03:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
so the statute also says that the
 
03:53:49.969 --> 03:53:49.979 align:start position:0%
responsibility to build to the code
 
03:53:52.729 --> 03:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
relies upon the permit holder or the
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
contractor but what we hear also is that
 
03:53:59.090 --> 03:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are local officials who
 
03:54:01.190 --> 03:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to I don't want to be
 
03:54:04.030 --> 03:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
too specific and I don't want to
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
make invidious remarks here
 
03:54:09.290 --> 03:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
um but who seem to almost make it up as
 
03:54:10.969 --> 03:54:10.979 align:start position:0%
they go along
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
um and make specific requirements each
 
03:54:15.530 --> 03:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
time that are not necessarily
 
03:54:15.540 --> 03:54:18.290 align:start position:0%
time that are not necessarily
evidence-based

03:54:18.290 --> 03:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
03:54:20.090 --> 03:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and again back to the Uniform
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code
 
03:54:24.290 --> 03:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't happen
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the local the local
 
03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
officials uh do not get to make specific
 
03:54:35.689 --> 03:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
commercial requirements on the local
 
03:54:38.210 --> 03:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
businesses and what I'm wondering and
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not saying this would be easy
 
03:54:42.229 --> 03:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying I'm asking you to
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
give a definitive answer but has anyone
 
03:54:49.250 --> 03:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
ever considered the possibility of doing
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
something similar with the building code
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
again allowing selling flexibility for
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
local needs but making it so that at
 
03:54:59.389 --> 03:54:59.399 align:start position:0%
least it's not possible
 
03:54:59.399 --> 03:55:00.229 align:start position:0%
least it's not possible
um

03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:03.170 --> 03:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
to have individualized arbitrary
 
03:55:03.180 --> 03:55:05.090 align:start position:0%
to have individualized arbitrary
requirements

03:55:05.090 --> 03:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:55:07.370 --> 03:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
yes and that was the intent when New
 
03:55:09.229 --> 03:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire moved to a Statewide building
 
03:55:10.910 --> 03:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
code you know we've we've had a
 
03:55:15.050 --> 03:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
Statewide Fire code for decades you know
 
03:55:15.060 --> 03:55:15.889 align:start position:0%
Statewide Fire code for decades you know
um

03:55:15.889 --> 03:55:15.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
long before we had a Statewide building
 
03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
code and the intent of the Statewide
 
03:55:22.130 --> 03:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
building code was to clear that up so
 
03:55:23.689 --> 03:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
that everybody was working under one
 
03:55:25.610 --> 03:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
code no matter where you are in the
 
03:55:28.010 --> 03:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
state and and I think we're we're
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
getting back there if you remember for a
 
03:55:32.809 --> 03:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
while in the state we we skipped a few
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
code process and we went three code
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
cycles that we didn't we didn't update
 
03:55:39.290 --> 03:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
our codes and it really came down to we
 
03:55:41.809 --> 03:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
were kind of it was almost a force type
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
situation that we were looking at the
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
inability to receive federal funding
 
03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
Federal grant monies we had insurance
 
03:55:51.229 --> 03:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
rate that rates that might be impacted
 
03:55:53.450 --> 03:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
because of being in a code that was so
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
update the legislature was great with
 
03:55:58.150 --> 03:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
working with us we were able to get the
 
03:56:02.150 --> 03:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
2015 codes adopted and last year
 
03:56:06.290 --> 03:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
actually in 2022 yes we were able to get
 
03:56:09.889 --> 03:56:09.899 align:start position:0%
the uh um 2018 codes move forward so
 
03:56:11.689 --> 03:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
those are in effect those are the 2018
 
03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
International codes and the 2018 NFL PA
 
03:56:19.389 --> 03:56:19.399 align:start position:0%
fire codes so those are in effect
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
and again we are hoping to move those
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
ahead again to get caught back up from
 
03:56:30.050 --> 03:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
when we had that long duration of not
 
03:56:32.330 --> 03:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
adopting current codes we need to we
 
03:56:33.889 --> 03:56:33.899 align:start position:0%
need to move in a
 
03:56:35.870 --> 03:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
every other year process for a few years
 
03:56:37.790 --> 03:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be up to date and then
 
03:56:40.370 --> 03:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
we'll if we can stay every three years
 
03:56:43.010 --> 03:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
we'll be in good shape thank you but and
 
03:56:46.490 --> 03:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
then education right okay well thank you
 
03:56:48.830 --> 03:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
Bill so much for coming and presenting
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
to us and I'm sure if we have questions
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
I can we have the email so we can just

anything thank you so much appreciate it
 
03:56:57.469 --> 03:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Alexander and
 
03:57:03.290 --> 03:57:03.300 align:start position:0%

can you send us the um the slideshow the
 
03:57:11.689 --> 03:57:11.699 align:start position:0%

or not to me also
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.849 --> 03:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
all right so our next presentation is
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
from Newmarket Town planner bark but
 
03:57:24.830 --> 03:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
dunno Bart thanks for coming
 
03:57:26.929 --> 03:57:26.939 align:start position:0%
at the invitation of Representative Reed
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
and representative Delorenzo
 
03:57:35.950 --> 03:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh representative
 
03:57:39.650 --> 03:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
Alexander and committee my name is
 
03:57:40.910 --> 03:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
Barbara McDonough I'm the planning
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
director of the Town New Market
 
03:57:45.290 --> 03:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
and I'm here specifically to talk about
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
accessory dwell units
 
03:57:47.399 --> 03:57:47.929 align:start position:0%
accessory dwell units
um

03:57:47.929 --> 03:57:47.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:50.090 --> 03:57:50.100 align:start position:0%
and I guess housing in general um I
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
would say I think
 
03:57:54.229 --> 03:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
first off accessory dwellings is a tool
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
in our toolbox that we can use to help
 
03:57:58.309 --> 03:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
solve the housing crisis that I think
 
03:58:01.790 --> 03:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
this is experiencing right now
 
03:58:01.800 --> 03:58:02.530 align:start position:0%
this is experiencing right now
um

03:58:02.530 --> 03:58:02.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:02.540 --> 03:58:04.490 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:58:04.490 --> 03:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:07.010 --> 03:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
this you know it's very
 
03:58:09.170 --> 03:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
it's a very useful tool I believe I
 
03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
think it'd be powerful it's less
 
03:58:14.090 --> 03:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
impactful into our communities the
 
03:58:16.250 --> 03:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
environment also
 
03:58:18.830 --> 03:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
potentially costs I think one thing
 
03:58:20.570 --> 03:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
right now that is
 
03:58:22.610 --> 03:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
a barrier to any Housing Development
 
03:58:25.370 --> 03:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
right now is cost financing really
 
03:58:28.250 --> 03:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
difficult in this climate but I think
 
03:58:30.410 --> 03:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
our overall goal if we extend our time
 
03:58:33.469 --> 03:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
Horizon on the housing is to set the
 
03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
state up in a manner that allows for it
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
to build when prices do come down
 
03:58:40.670 --> 03:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why I think amending the
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
um statue and also potentially looking
 
03:58:47.269 --> 03:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
at other statutes
 
03:58:49.729 --> 03:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
that allow for more density would be
 
03:58:51.889 --> 03:58:51.899 align:start position:0%
prudent and continue
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
um you know reviewing that what makes
 
03:58:55.610 --> 03:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
sense another critical aspect is
 
03:58:55.620 --> 03:58:57.050 align:start position:0%
sense another critical aspect is
infrastructure

03:58:57.050 --> 03:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's really critical
 
03:58:59.809 --> 03:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
um especially I know the last
 
03:59:01.490 --> 03:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
presentation we talked about septids
 
03:59:03.290 --> 03:59:03.300 align:start position:0%
receiving early septic system that
 
03:59:05.450 --> 03:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
septic has to go somewhere you need to
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
go to a wastewater treatment facility
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
so in our rural communities it might be
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
imperative not every Community can build
 
03:59:13.969 --> 03:59:13.979 align:start position:0%
one they're very expensive but
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
maintaining them and upgrading them
 
03:59:20.210 --> 03:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
strategically so that sections that is
 
03:59:22.849 --> 03:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
taken from communities can be placed
 
03:59:22.859 --> 03:59:24.670 align:start position:0%
taken from communities can be placed
there

03:59:24.670 --> 03:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
in a very environmentally
 
03:59:30.650 --> 03:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
um a sustainable way so
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
um like I said keep this really brief
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
and I'll happy to answer anything about
 
03:59:36.710 --> 03:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities what we're experiencing
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
new market and maybe some ideas moving
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
forward if you have anything on zoning
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
orange changes but
 
03:59:43.920 --> 03:59:44.630 align:start position:0%
orange changes but
um

03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:47.330 --> 03:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
upgrade infrastructure allow for more
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility for um from the state
 
03:59:52.130 --> 03:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
statutes to allow for different types of
 
03:59:52.140 --> 03:59:53.090 align:start position:0%
statutes to allow for different types of
housing

03:59:53.090 --> 03:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:59:55.490 --> 03:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
and allow for more density where
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate so that's my three things I
 
04:00:01.010 --> 04:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
want to communicate to you all and I'll
 
04:00:02.809 --> 04:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you have
 
04:00:06.769 --> 04:00:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
we just amended our ordinance to allow
 
04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.330 --> 04:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
04:00:29.929 --> 04:00:29.939 align:start position:0%
New Market I believe had
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling they used to call
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
them accessory Apartments
 
04:00:36.050 --> 04:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
since 1996.
 
04:00:37.729 --> 04:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
um it was by special exception so you
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
had to go to the Zone board adjustment
 
04:00:44.170 --> 04:00:44.180 align:start position:0%
for um that approval and if anyone knows
 
04:00:46.969 --> 04:00:46.979 align:start position:0%
for conditional use or in Newmarket we
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
call a special use permit and really you
 
04:00:50.630 --> 04:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
just have to demonstrate like six
 
04:00:52.910 --> 04:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
criteria I mean it was approved but it
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
was still a barrier
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
um at that time it only allowed for a
 
04:00:56.399 --> 04:00:58.130 align:start position:0%
um at that time it only allowed for a
touch

04:00:58.130 --> 04:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
touch
 
04:01:01.630 --> 04:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
and you had to obtain a variance
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
before going to the you know the same
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
body to ask for the special exception
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
and they're always denied and it
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
Newmarket being a very old Community has
 
04:01:14.450 --> 04:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of non-conformities and
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
um and the applications made sense but
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the zoning was contrary
 
04:01:23.510 --> 04:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
to it and they were very stringent
 
04:01:25.849 --> 04:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so there was no flexibility there at
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
all so
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
and um also New Market between 1996 and
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
so why why is that that doesn't seem
 
04:01:44.030 --> 04:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
like a lot uh yeah I think it was a lot
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
of hurdles
 
04:01:47.450 --> 04:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
um it also part of the
 
04:01:47.460 --> 04:01:48.889 align:start position:0%
um it also part of the
um

04:01:48.889 --> 04:01:48.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
are the criteria one of the Criterium
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
was that all aspects of the law had to
 
04:01:56.570 --> 04:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
be conforming
 
04:02:00.170 --> 04:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
so New Market being 17 I don't know 40
 
04:02:02.689 --> 04:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
something 50 something had a lot of
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
non-conformities and zonings evolved
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
Through The Years where there was a
 
04:02:08.330 --> 04:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
period where there was a pendulum swing
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
to anti-development
 
04:02:10.560 --> 04:02:12.590 align:start position:0%
to anti-development
so

04:02:12.590 --> 04:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:15.050 --> 04:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
um because of that you didn't see it
 
04:02:15.060 --> 04:02:15.889 align:start position:0%
um because of that you didn't see it
after

04:02:15.889 --> 04:02:15.899 align:start position:0%
after
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the things we
 
04:02:19.250 --> 04:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
addressed in the new ordinance I can go
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
into in a little more detail on the
 
04:02:23.210 --> 04:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
ordinance Amendment
 
04:02:26.090 --> 04:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
so uh what we did in New Market recently
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
so what really spurred this was Town
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
Council and plan board had a meeting to
 
04:02:35.090 --> 04:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
you know see where they can address
 
04:02:35.100 --> 04:02:35.929 align:start position:0%
you know see where they can address
um

04:02:35.929 --> 04:02:35.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
issues or roadblocks impediments to
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
Housing Development and one of them was
 
04:02:42.410 --> 04:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
adus they thought it was a good
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity a good start
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
to you know start the conversation and
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
see if there's you know some consensus
 
04:02:51.889 --> 04:02:51.899 align:start position:0%
there so
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
um Town Council directed plan board and
 
04:02:55.910 --> 04:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
kind of side note here uh planning board
 
04:02:58.490 --> 04:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
and new markets elected so so actually
 
04:03:00.530 --> 04:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
two different you know elected bodies
 
04:03:03.410 --> 04:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
which is a interesting for a town that
 
04:03:03.420 --> 04:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
which is a interesting for a town that
size

04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
size
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
So the plan board um started reviewing
 
04:03:11.330 --> 04:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
it and looking over and seeing where
 
04:03:12.650 --> 04:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
um some flexibility in places to improve
 
04:03:17.689 --> 04:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
and they did that and one of them was
 
04:03:21.429 --> 04:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
that if you're a single family lot
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of your Conformity you could
 
04:03:25.309 --> 04:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
build an Adu by right
 
04:03:27.469 --> 04:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
either attached
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
um or detach as well if you had an
 
04:03:32.090 --> 04:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
existing structure so I'm thinking of
 
04:03:34.250 --> 04:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
your barn supercarriage you know like
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
that so but if you're going to build
 
04:03:37.969 --> 04:03:37.979 align:start position:0%
something new you have to conform at
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
least to your setbacks but your lot size
 
04:03:41.450 --> 04:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
didn't matter
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
so long as you are a single family love
 
04:03:46.790 --> 04:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh conform not legally non-conformisting
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
of them a lot
 
04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
so um so that that passed um will ever
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
detached the minimum size the range was
 
04:03:57.290 --> 04:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
between 300 and a thousand square feet
 
04:03:59.090 --> 04:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
um one of the other
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
caveats there was
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
um if we're not contrary to the state
 
04:04:06.050 --> 04:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
law which you have to allow for 750
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
square feet size
 
04:04:09.000 --> 04:04:09.830 align:start position:0%
square feet size
um

04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
he Adu had to be 80 percent of the
 
04:04:15.790 --> 04:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
square footage of the single family
 
04:04:18.590 --> 04:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
dwelling this goes to scale you know you
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
kind of want to make sure the scale of
 
04:04:23.929 --> 04:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
your accessory dwelling unit doesn't
 
04:04:26.030 --> 04:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
exceed the scale of your primary
 
04:04:28.010 --> 04:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit so which is bigger you
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
know you wanna you want
 
04:04:31.610 --> 04:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
you want to look at it's like this is an
 
04:04:33.170 --> 04:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit this is not my
 
04:04:35.210 --> 04:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
primary dwell unit so that was that was
 
04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
the concern
 
04:04:40.010 --> 04:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
um so that was put into it
 
04:04:41.150 --> 04:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a bunch of other Provisions
 
04:04:44.689 --> 04:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
going to if you wish but um but it was
 
04:04:47.689 --> 04:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
well received we did initially
 
04:04:47.699 --> 04:04:48.710 align:start position:0%
well received we did initially
um

04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:52.370 --> 04:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
uh the language tried to go for two uh
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
accessory dual units
 
04:04:56.210 --> 04:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
um through a special use primary or
 
04:04:58.370 --> 04:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
conditional use but um the town at that
 
04:05:00.889 --> 04:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
time felt that wasn't appropriate
 
04:05:03.170 --> 04:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
um because we really want to see how
 
04:05:05.809 --> 04:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
this would take off and I'll report that
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
no permits have been filed
 
04:05:10.130 --> 04:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
um but that just goes back to my other
 
04:05:11.389 --> 04:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
point because I don't think anyone can
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
afford it
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay yeah go ahead
 
04:05:18.189 --> 04:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative McConkey
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative representative McDonough
 
04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm apologize Mr McDonough is of course
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
my town planner and he's been very
 
04:05:27.769 --> 04:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
instrumental for full disclosure and in
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
helping with hb423
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
um but you've been the planner in New
 
04:05:35.210 --> 04:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
Market for I think two years or so I
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
started last April so a little over a
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
year a little over a year
 
04:05:40.490 --> 04:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
um so since he's comment hasn't been so
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
controversial but I think I started this
 
04:05:45.530 --> 04:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
three or three and a half years ago and
 
04:05:47.750 --> 04:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
it was started by that constituent who
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
was being denied the ability to put an
 
04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
in-law apartment inside of his detached
 
04:05:55.010 --> 04:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
garage and at that time I went to the
 
04:05:57.170 --> 04:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
then Town planner of Newmarket not Mr
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
McDonough who and I got into a you know
 
04:06:03.050 --> 04:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
a philosophical debate about needing
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
more housing and this is before the
 
04:06:06.849 --> 04:06:06.859 align:start position:0%
housing crisis was as bad as it is now
 
04:06:10.849 --> 04:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
and was told oh those people we do
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
enough for those people they have the
 
04:06:15.889 --> 04:06:15.899 align:start position:0%
apartment and the trailers and so I'm
 
04:06:17.809 --> 04:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
very happy we have Mr McDonough now but
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
the point is is that it was it was a
 
04:06:22.250 --> 04:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
fight I started in response to that I
 
04:06:23.630 --> 04:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
started a little group called New Market
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
Housing Coalition and we flooded a
 
04:06:28.490 --> 04:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
planning board meeting with people this
 
04:06:30.170 --> 04:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
is right at the beginning of the
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we all went on zoom and
 
04:06:35.090 --> 04:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
insisted on ideas so it was actually a
 
04:06:37.370 --> 04:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
fight before Mr McDonough got there and
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.239 --> 04:06:44.090 align:start position:0%
 
episode

04:06:44.090 --> 04:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
episode
 
04:06:46.490 --> 04:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say one more thing and
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
we do allow for manufacturer homes that
 
04:06:52.370 --> 04:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
allow uh detached in Newmarket so
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's another thing that we do uh
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
04:06:59.689 --> 04:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you take my question
 
04:07:02.929 --> 04:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
can you expand on you said the three
 
04:07:05.210 --> 04:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
concepts the legislature might work on
 
04:07:07.250 --> 04:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
on the more flexibility for different
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
types of housing
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I think Numark is about to embark
 
04:07:14.750 --> 04:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
on this adventure um we're going to
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
rezone part of the town and part of the
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
idea is at missing middle housing you
 
04:07:21.710 --> 04:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
might have heard that term before so I
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
think about your duplexes just
 
04:07:25.729 --> 04:07:25.739 align:start position:0%
fourplexes six plexus
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
in Newmarket we have a lot of
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and we have
 
04:07:31.849 --> 04:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of apartment buildings eight plus
 
04:07:34.010 --> 04:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
units we have nothing in the middle
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
and that's where I think we can make a
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
large Headway um large advances
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and what you're doing there too is
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
you're not transforming your
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods you're integrating into
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
your neighborhoods
 
04:07:48.969 --> 04:07:48.979 align:start position:0%
my hypothesis is people understand
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
there's a housing issue there's a
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
housing crisis in the country especially
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
in New England and New Hampshire
 
04:07:59.090 --> 04:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
the problem is their major asset is
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
their property in their house and they
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't want that to be affected
 
04:08:06.650 --> 04:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
so the challenge is how do you integrate
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
more density
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
without the perception of people's
 
04:08:13.450 --> 04:08:13.460 align:start position:0%
properties being
 
04:08:15.650 --> 04:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
negatively affected or impacted if
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's right or wrong you know the
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
Market's very subjective as we know so
 
04:08:21.170 --> 04:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
but I think you can do it in a very
 
04:08:22.389 --> 04:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
mindful way
 
04:08:26.450 --> 04:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing is focusing in New
 
04:08:27.889 --> 04:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
Market what we're doing is focuses on
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
missing middle housing and we're going
 
04:08:32.150 --> 04:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
to go from a form-based code method
 
04:08:33.410 --> 04:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be a community
 
04:08:35.090 --> 04:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
iterative process as we go through the
 
04:08:38.090 --> 04:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
zoning amendment process so you know
 
04:08:39.530 --> 04:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
doing small focus groups in
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods you know this is which
 
04:08:43.610 --> 04:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
we're doing New Market I'm not sure you
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
know every Community is going to be
 
04:08:47.330 --> 04:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
different but
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
creating consensus on design I think
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
design is really important when you're
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
asking for more density in neighborhoods
 
04:08:59.689 --> 04:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
so because people just
 
04:09:01.849 --> 04:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
in general I think in human nature
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
change is
 
04:09:04.439 --> 04:09:05.510 align:start position:0%
change is
um

04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:08.090 --> 04:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
it's not it's hard to accept but it's
 
04:09:10.729 --> 04:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
inevitable so
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's really bringing everyone to
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
the table brings stakeholders to the
 
04:09:17.090 --> 04:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
table and you know creating consensus
 
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
you know consensus you know no one's
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
happy but they're happy to move forward
 
04:09:24.290 --> 04:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
with what they do so
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's that's that's my
 
04:09:28.370 --> 04:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
hypothesis that's what we want to go
 
04:09:30.650 --> 04:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
with and that could change too but if
 
04:09:32.689 --> 04:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
the legislator were to look into missing
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
middle housing like those you know those
 
04:09:38.929 --> 04:09:38.939 align:start position:0%
medium densely small density options I
 
04:09:40.490 --> 04:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
think that could go a long way
 
04:09:44.210 --> 04:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
so that like for example the four Plex
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
um you know legislation you know that
 
04:09:48.530 --> 04:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
could be fine-tuned and tailored and you
 
04:09:48.540 --> 04:09:49.309 align:start position:0%
could be fine-tuned and tailored and you
know

04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:09:50.689 --> 04:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
um I think there might be some
 
04:09:52.849 --> 04:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity there for the legislative
 
04:09:55.550 --> 04:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
great representative
 
04:10:00.410 --> 04:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
um do you go do you guys have
 
04:10:07.490 --> 04:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
um septic in sewer
 
04:10:11.450 --> 04:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
um over a large part of your or how much
 
04:10:14.570 --> 04:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
percentage I guess of your of your um
 
04:10:19.250 --> 04:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
town and also when you are have these
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
zoning uh changes what percentage do you
 
04:10:26.809 --> 04:10:26.819 align:start position:0%
believe is non-conforming because of
 
04:10:30.110 --> 04:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
that because under the existing
 
04:10:33.969 --> 04:10:33.979 align:start position:0%
um regulations and art is part of your
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
goal to reduce
 
04:10:41.570 --> 04:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
the the amount of non-conformity by the
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
um between the zoning ordinance and what
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
is the situation on the ground yeah um
 
04:10:49.010 --> 04:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
New Market is a lot of non-conforming
 
04:10:50.330 --> 04:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
they're legally non-conforming
 
04:10:50.340 --> 04:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
they're legally non-conforming
structures

04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
structures
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:10:55.969 --> 04:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
um and lots so the goal of zoning is
 
04:10:57.290 --> 04:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
always to try to you know find that
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
balance you know you know bring
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
everything into conformance
 
04:11:00.960 --> 04:11:01.670 align:start position:0%
everything into conformance
um

04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:05.090 --> 04:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
and you know realistically you can't do
 
04:11:05.100 --> 04:11:06.290 align:start position:0%
and you know realistically you can't do
that

04:11:06.290 --> 04:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:09.110 --> 04:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and that process takes a long time so
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
you kind of identify areas
 
04:11:16.070 --> 04:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
um that you think is the
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
the easiest I guess lack of a better
 
04:11:20.210 --> 04:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
word to try to fix
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
um so so in that in that area you know
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
we we try to focus on you know where are
 
04:11:27.889 --> 04:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
those opportunities we can Max we can
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
leverage most to bring things in more
 
04:11:33.410 --> 04:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
um Conformity and also self an issue a
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
problem that the town has
 
04:11:38.929 --> 04:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
um the circle back to your septic and
 
04:11:38.939 --> 04:11:40.189 align:start position:0%
um the circle back to your septic and
Wastewater

04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
Wastewater
 
04:11:42.010 --> 04:11:42.020 align:start position:0%
um at the core downtown
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
and the surrounding the downtown is all
 
04:11:47.210 --> 04:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
on Water and Sewer As you move further
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
away from that that's when you
 
04:11:49.439 --> 04:11:50.450 align:start position:0%
away from that that's when you
um

04:11:50.450 --> 04:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:53.630 --> 04:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
go into septic systems and Wells
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
so percentage
 
04:11:57.790 --> 04:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say I would say
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
rough you know Russ estimate I would say
 
04:12:06.650 --> 04:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
70 septic well 30 sewer
 
04:12:07.969 --> 04:12:07.979 align:start position:0%
um so that's where you see all your core
 
04:12:10.969 --> 04:12:10.979 align:start position:0%
density too because of that
 
04:12:10.979 --> 04:12:11.929 align:start position:0%
density too because of that
um

04:12:11.929 --> 04:12:11.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:11.939 --> 04:12:14.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.849 --> 04:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
you know new markets in a really good
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
position right now they made a lot of
 
04:12:20.689 --> 04:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
investment in their wastewater treatment
 
04:12:24.050 --> 04:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
facility and their Wells and
 
04:12:26.210 --> 04:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
um you know we have a the capacity to
 
04:12:26.220 --> 04:12:27.950 align:start position:0%
um you know we have a the capacity to
expand

04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
expand
 
04:12:29.090 --> 04:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
um that's why we're looking at certain
 
04:12:32.210 --> 04:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
areas in town where we can we're for
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
instance on Route 108 going towards the
 
04:12:36.050 --> 04:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
Durham line
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
um we laid um septic and water there in
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
anticipation that something will be done
 
04:12:44.929 --> 04:12:44.939 align:start position:0%
in the future so when they're redoing
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
108 or renovating it we had that
 
04:12:51.530 --> 04:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity so I think
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
where you want to con um
 
04:12:56.090 --> 04:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
concentrate your density is where you
 
04:12:57.849 --> 04:12:57.859 align:start position:0%
have your infrastructure
 
04:13:01.429 --> 04:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
and you know for the adus when we made
 
04:13:04.130 --> 04:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
these changes these aren't really large
 
04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
asks on the property you know every
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
property is going to be different so
 
04:13:09.530 --> 04:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
this is where you want to see that type
 
04:13:10.910 --> 04:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
of development you don't want to see
 
04:13:13.370 --> 04:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
your large developments and your rural
 
04:13:15.530 --> 04:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
area you want to see your density
 
04:13:18.650 --> 04:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
downtown or where the infrastructure is
 
04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
where it's located and you want to
 
04:13:23.469 --> 04:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
preserve those areas too
 
04:13:27.650 --> 04:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
so I think as communities look to add
 
04:13:27.660 --> 04:13:29.450 align:start position:0%
so I think as communities look to add
density

04:13:29.450 --> 04:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
density
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's specifically in those core
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
areas of you know more urban areas of
 
04:13:36.239 --> 04:13:37.429 align:start position:0%
areas of you know more urban areas of
communities

04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:13:37.439 --> 04:13:38.389 align:start position:0%
communities
okay

04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:43.490 --> 04:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
um as you built out this infrastructure
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
for your water and sewer did were you
 
04:13:52.010 --> 04:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
um also updating the density for those
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
that area so that
 
04:13:57.290 --> 04:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
um that more people will be able to tie
 
04:14:00.530 --> 04:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
in and and did you
 
04:14:00.540 --> 04:14:02.030 align:start position:0%
in and and did you
um

04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
um as far as there's a you know the
 
04:14:06.769 --> 04:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
fixed cost per mile
 
04:14:08.990 --> 04:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
um was there a Target when you were
 
04:14:11.689 --> 04:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
looking at that possible increase of
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
density as far as like the the burden
 
04:14:15.790 --> 04:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
for each individual
 
04:14:19.010 --> 04:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayer using that that property right
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think at the time the idea was
 
04:14:24.830 --> 04:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
two two things one there was an
 
04:14:26.689 --> 04:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
opportunity from dot when they were
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
renovating 108. they were ripping
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
everything up so it said this is a good
 
04:14:31.969 --> 04:14:31.979 align:start position:0%
opportunity to expand so they did that
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
in anticipation that's something that
 
04:14:37.250 --> 04:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
Corridor will um will take place in the
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
future the second part of that question
 
04:14:42.830 --> 04:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
is the town engaged with a consultant to
 
04:14:45.769 --> 04:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
look at gateways in the town so um
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
towards Epping Durham and then new
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
fields in anticipation that you know
 
04:14:52.610 --> 04:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
there will be future development down
 
04:14:56.570 --> 04:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
there on those in those areas and we
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
focus on the Durham one the North
 
04:15:01.790 --> 04:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
Gateway right now as
 
04:15:03.290 --> 04:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
the first step because that's where the
 
04:15:05.570 --> 04:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is so answer your
 
04:15:08.150 --> 04:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
question yes as we look to expand
 
04:15:10.370 --> 04:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's where we want to
 
04:15:15.410 --> 04:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:17.630 --> 04:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
people that are on it the less you know
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in a way we also look
 
04:15:22.010 --> 04:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
for Grants so we're not just putting the
 
04:15:25.010 --> 04:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
whole burden on the user we're also
 
04:15:26.689 --> 04:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
looking at other opportunities to
 
04:15:26.699 --> 04:15:28.189 align:start position:0%
looking at other opportunities to
supplement

04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
supplement
 
04:15:28.199 --> 04:15:29.750 align:start position:0%
supplement
um

04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:31.849 --> 04:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
um costs or so the reduced cost for
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
instance um
 
04:15:35.689 --> 04:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
we have sepsis receiving and we're
 
04:15:37.309 --> 04:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
upgrading that in order to take on other
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
communities because
 
04:15:42.290 --> 04:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
um right now some some of our
 
04:15:43.790 --> 04:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
communities surrounding Newmarket aren't
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
able to take it and their wastewater
 
04:15:49.070 --> 04:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
treatment so New Market has stepped up
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
and was able to
 
04:15:54.650 --> 04:15:54.660 align:start position:0%
um take on that so seeing there's such a
 
04:15:56.929 --> 04:15:56.939 align:start position:0%
demand we had the funding or at least
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms to upgrade the septage
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
receiving so in anticipation we you know
 
04:16:04.969 --> 04:16:04.979 align:start position:0%
take on more so
 
04:16:07.130 --> 04:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
and that's that saves costs that's money
 
04:16:07.140 --> 04:16:08.389 align:start position:0%
and that's that saves costs that's money
generated

04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
generated
 
04:16:12.650 --> 04:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:15.229 --> 04:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
um and thank you you gave me a new term
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
I didn't know missing middle housing is
 
04:16:20.689 --> 04:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
that a reference and has your town
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
starting putting an ordinance together
 
04:16:25.610 --> 04:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
on that or you're you're about to okay
 
04:16:28.570 --> 04:16:28.580 align:start position:0%
so we received um invest New Hampshire
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
hop Grant I received a hundred thousand
 
04:16:34.969 --> 04:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
dollars 125 000 uh 25 000 is going to
 
04:16:37.250 --> 04:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
our Master Plan update which will begin
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
next year
 
04:16:40.729 --> 04:16:40.739 align:start position:0%
and then the other hundred thousands
 
04:16:43.010 --> 04:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
going towards the rezoning effort so
 
04:16:46.370 --> 04:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
that seems like a large sum and it is
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
um but again the idea is the the
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
approach we're taking it's going to be
 
04:16:51.239 --> 04:16:52.969 align:start position:0%
approach we're taking it's going to be
Community

04:16:52.969 --> 04:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
Community
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
um events so we're going out to you know
 
04:16:58.490 --> 04:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
doing small focus groups you know um and
 
04:17:00.410 --> 04:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
um a lot of Tourette's in order to
 
04:17:03.170 --> 04:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
create consensus and then also design so
 
04:17:06.170 --> 04:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
hiring an architect you know to
 
04:17:08.090 --> 04:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
you know as they're having these
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
conversations sketch up what they're
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
hearing and then from there we um engage
 
04:17:16.130 --> 04:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
with a land use expert and they um
 
04:17:19.010 --> 04:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
design a form-based code so when that
 
04:17:21.229 --> 04:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
when that draft becomes available if you
 
04:17:22.969 --> 04:17:22.979 align:start position:0%
could send that to Chairman that would
 
04:17:24.670 --> 04:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
be absolutely no matter when it's done
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
and do I understand you right so I I
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
would I would hear a term used in cities
 
04:17:33.530 --> 04:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
all the time in Phil I've got a I've got
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
a vacant lot and you know that's not
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
being used in a village or whatever but
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're actually talking about adding
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
instead of infill on a separate lot
 
04:17:43.610 --> 04:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
you're saying that there might be a
 
04:17:46.130 --> 04:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
possibility put another structure into
 
04:17:48.769 --> 04:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
that lot or would it be added on to that
 
04:17:51.290 --> 04:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
lot yeah onto the existing building so
 
04:17:52.969 --> 04:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
yeah I think every lot's going to be
 
04:17:54.650 --> 04:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
different circumstance but there might
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
be opportunities where
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the large lot is large enough based
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
on the codes
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
um requirements are the zoning codes
 
04:18:05.090 --> 04:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
requirements and you can add a new
 
04:18:07.130 --> 04:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
structure you know maybe it's smaller
 
04:18:09.050 --> 04:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
but you can add something that's kind of
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to accomplish with the
 
04:18:13.729 --> 04:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit ordinance a new
 
04:18:16.610 --> 04:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
market when we amended the you know add
 
04:18:18.550 --> 04:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
smaller footprint
 
04:18:24.170 --> 04:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
structures thank you uh representative
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking another
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:33.290 --> 04:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
my in my community we kind of contract
 
04:18:35.150 --> 04:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
our planner to the regional Planning
 
04:18:35.160 --> 04:18:36.530 align:start position:0%
our planner to the regional Planning
Commission

04:18:36.530 --> 04:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
um how much
 
04:18:39.600 --> 04:18:40.309 align:start position:0%
um how much
um

04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:42.110 --> 04:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
how is your relationship with them I
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
guess have they been very helpful of as
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
far as like giving ideas or or
 
04:18:48.180 --> 04:18:49.309 align:start position:0%
far as like giving ideas or or
um

04:18:49.309 --> 04:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
yeah just like how do you see that kind
 
04:18:55.010 --> 04:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
of relationship between
 
04:18:58.189 --> 04:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
um your town and the regional Planning
 
04:18:58.199 --> 04:19:00.349 align:start position:0%
um your town and the regional Planning
Commission

04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
I think it's critical there are a huge
 
04:19:06.290 --> 04:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
asset to the municipality they help
 
04:19:08.929 --> 04:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
identify Grant monies they help you know
 
04:19:11.929 --> 04:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
they're really they're actually you know
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
essential to transportation
 
04:19:17.150 --> 04:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
um and um in front of the housing
 
04:19:17.160 --> 04:19:18.830 align:start position:0%
um and um in front of the housing
perspective

04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:19:18.840 --> 04:19:19.670 align:start position:0%
perspective
um

04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're always there to help you figure
 
04:19:25.550 --> 04:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
out so you know Newmark is different you
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm the planner there so
 
04:19:30.530 --> 04:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I use them in a different capacity
 
04:19:34.130 --> 04:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
than other municipalities um do but
 
04:19:37.010 --> 04:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
um the communities that I know that of
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
Stratford Regional Planning Commission
 
04:19:41.450 --> 04:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
do contract with they're doing a lot for
 
04:19:43.610 --> 04:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
them so
 
04:19:47.410 --> 04:19:47.420 align:start position:0%
um so I think they're a huge asset and
 
04:19:51.729 --> 04:19:51.739 align:start position:0%
I'm very grateful for their support
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:57.170 --> 04:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
um as far since you guys have just
 
04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
recently kind of expanded your water and
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
sewer stuff and we're looking for kind
 
04:20:07.490 --> 04:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
of money to go into that did you use
 
04:20:07.500 --> 04:20:08.450 align:start position:0%
of money to go into that did you use
um

04:20:08.450 --> 04:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
impact fees as far for water do you have
 
04:20:15.530 --> 04:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
an impact fee for water and sewer and
 
04:20:18.290 --> 04:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
um was the six-year time frame do you
 
04:20:19.969 --> 04:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
think that was
 
04:20:21.950 --> 04:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
um too short for being able to hold on
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
to water impact fees and if the state
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
um I guess kind of like how that funding
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
mechanism went and if the state was
 
04:20:34.859 --> 04:20:35.870 align:start position:0%
mechanism went and if the state was
um

04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:40.490 --> 04:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
trying to support that in some way maybe
 
04:20:43.010 --> 04:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
um you know through low interest money
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines what
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
how would that be received and if there
 
04:20:48.889 --> 04:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
are strings attached saying that you had
 
04:20:52.130 --> 04:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
to be you know more density would you do
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
you think that your community would have
 
04:20:55.849 --> 04:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
still accepted it if it if they'd said
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
hey you have to have increased density
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
if on this along this this line if
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to be accepting our you
 
04:21:04.080 --> 04:21:04.849 align:start position:0%
you're going to be accepting our you
know

04:21:04.849 --> 04:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
our money would use what would you think
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
and recently has amended it to remove
 
04:21:20.090 --> 04:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
water and sewer interesting move towards
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
assistant development charge
 
04:21:26.090 --> 04:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
so basically what that does is takes all
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
the assets
 
04:21:29.809 --> 04:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer so they're going to be
 
04:21:33.050 --> 04:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
two different rates and creates a new
 
04:21:36.349 --> 04:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
um buy-in fee based on
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the depreciation
 
04:21:39.650 --> 04:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
appreciation the investment and whatnot
 
04:21:42.170 --> 04:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
and puts it all into one you know buy
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
and fee moving forward so it hasn't been
 
04:21:46.429 --> 04:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
adopted yet plain board still has to
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
amend the methodology
 
04:21:51.769 --> 04:21:51.779 align:start position:0%
um so uh so we're under that process but
 
04:21:53.689 --> 04:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
yeah the six year you know it's really
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's really Community specific really
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
um you know based on the community's
 
04:22:01.370 --> 04:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
needs from water to sewer perspective
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
um you know if there's a limited
 
04:22:03.720 --> 04:22:04.490 align:start position:0%
um you know if there's a limited
um

04:22:04.490 --> 04:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:06.370 --> 04:22:06.380 align:start position:0%
uh if there's not a lot of development
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
04:22:09.950 --> 04:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
you know limited infrastructure might
 
04:22:12.170 --> 04:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
not be worth it at all so
 
04:22:13.969 --> 04:22:13.979 align:start position:0%
um I would say that's a community
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
specific issue for impact fees but I do
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
see their usefulness
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
could there be a maybe new language
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
introduced to allow for more time
 
04:22:24.479 --> 04:22:26.150 align:start position:0%
introduced to allow for more time
sure

04:22:26.150 --> 04:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
um but you know maybe the legislature
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
should look at you know what are those
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
requirements so left for more time you
 
04:22:33.110 --> 04:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
know to allow those impact fees to stay
 
04:22:34.969 --> 04:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
with the municipality before the return
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the developer or the landowner
 
04:22:39.290 --> 04:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe there's a set of
 
04:22:41.150 --> 04:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
criteria but you have to
 
04:22:41.160 --> 04:22:43.070 align:start position:0%
criteria but you have to
fulfill

04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
fulfill
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
great all right I'm gonna go
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Delorenzo representative
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
Gibbs representative Reed and then we're
 
04:22:54.769 --> 04:22:54.779 align:start position:0%
gonna call it on this thank you Mr here
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon Mr mcdonner nice to
 
04:22:58.010 --> 04:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
meet you
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
um you know what the um changes and um
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
affordable housing opportunities in the
 
04:23:06.410 --> 04:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
town of Newmarket for instance instant
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
CM Adu units and then the um
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
the missing middle proposed missing
 
04:23:16.969 --> 04:23:16.979 align:start position:0%
middle housing has been been any
 
04:23:20.210 --> 04:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
pushback from residents about fears of
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
04:23:24.530 --> 04:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
housing becoming student housing
 
04:23:26.809 --> 04:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
yeah there's always a new market always
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
had that um that um kind of Specter you
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
know but we're seeing a new market is
 
04:23:37.010 --> 04:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
the students are retreating there's a
 
04:23:38.570 --> 04:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
lot of housing being built in Durham and
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities
 
04:23:45.290 --> 04:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
and a really I indicator that as we're
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
losing busing the Wildcat Transit is no
 
04:23:50.150 --> 04:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
longer going to be servicing a new
 
04:23:53.210 --> 04:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
market so ridership is down
 
04:23:55.849 --> 04:23:55.859 align:start position:0%
um but there's still always that
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
um that fear it's going to be more
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
student housing you know more density
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
means more students I don't necessarily
 
04:24:03.110 --> 04:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
um just based on the amount of housing
 
04:24:09.769 --> 04:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
that's available today and behavior of
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
students they're going to be as close as
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
possible I want to be close as possible
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
to the university so um you know but
 
04:24:18.469 --> 04:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
there's always
 
04:24:19.610 --> 04:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
it's always worth having those
 
04:24:20.990 --> 04:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
conversations and you know understand
 
04:24:24.410 --> 04:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:28.670 --> 04:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
04:24:32.210 --> 04:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that uh Newmarket is in
 
04:24:34.729 --> 04:24:34.739 align:start position:0%
the process of changing from a specific
 
04:24:38.269 --> 04:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
order and Sewer impact fee to a to
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
including that in a generalized uh
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
development fee
 
04:24:43.080 --> 04:24:44.330 align:start position:0%
development fee
um

04:24:44.330 --> 04:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
that is allowable under current statutes
 
04:24:50.750 --> 04:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
um uh because we were talking earlier
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
the reason that I asked is because we
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
were talking earlier about uh current
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
statutes requiring certain types of fees
 
04:25:02.450 --> 04:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
to be designated only for specific uses
 
04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
as for order and Sewer or schools or
 
04:25:06.000 --> 04:25:07.490 align:start position:0%
as for order and Sewer or schools or
fire

04:25:07.490 --> 04:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
fire
 
04:25:09.889 --> 04:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
um but in fact you're able to commingle
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
it all in one uh development fee account
 
04:25:15.110 --> 04:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
right so this is just specific to Water
 
04:25:16.969 --> 04:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
and Sewer on the system development
 
04:25:19.130 --> 04:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
charts we'll still have impact fees for
 
04:25:21.530 --> 04:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
recreation in schools so those will
 
04:25:25.729 --> 04:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
still be assessed as legislated right
 
04:25:28.729 --> 04:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
now in New Market so the reason why the
 
04:25:30.530 --> 04:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
town's moving forward with this approach
 
04:25:31.790 --> 04:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
there has to be a Nexus between a
 
04:25:36.050 --> 04:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
development and the impact fee so for
 
04:25:38.030 --> 04:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
instance expanding a sewer line wire
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
line to that specific parcel land that
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
affects the
 
04:25:42.479 --> 04:25:43.090 align:start position:0%
affects the
um

04:25:43.090 --> 04:25:43.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:46.010 --> 04:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
that the development paid for
 
04:25:48.290 --> 04:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
whereas the system development charge
 
04:25:50.330 --> 04:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
you can use that for anything within the
 
04:25:52.969 --> 04:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
system so you know upgrade your you know
 
04:25:55.610 --> 04:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
sewer treatment plan expanding uh water
 
04:25:57.769 --> 04:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
line where it needs to be so there's
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
more flexibility for the municipality
 
04:26:01.849 --> 04:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
under the system development charge to
 
04:26:04.250 --> 04:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
utilize that money more effectively to
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
target areas where your overall system
 
04:26:09.769 --> 04:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
needs it that's that's the main impetus
 
04:26:11.809 --> 04:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
so the development fee will in fact
 
04:26:15.110 --> 04:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
still go towards Water and Sewer uh but
 
04:26:18.649 --> 04:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
it can be used more broadly to improve
 
04:26:21.469 --> 04:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
capacity rather than just extending the
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
lines exactly more targeted I mean
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's more flexibility for for the
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
municipality to utilize that money to
 
04:26:30.889 --> 04:26:30.899 align:start position:0%
its best potential thank you
 
04:26:30.899 --> 04:26:32.689 align:start position:0%
its best potential thank you
representative

04:26:32.689 --> 04:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and obviously thank you for
 
04:26:36.889 --> 04:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
coming today
 
04:26:39.469 --> 04:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
um so I was hoping since we did bring
 
04:26:41.389 --> 04:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
you here specifically
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
um because of your work with Adu in town
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
and also
 
04:26:48.349 --> 04:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
um vetting uh hb423 uh if I could just
 
04:26:49.969 --> 04:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
go through real quick I know you've read
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
it before but the points in hb423 so
 
04:26:56.090 --> 04:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
that um we could hear directly any
 
04:26:59.570 --> 04:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
commentary you might have so I'm just
 
04:27:01.790 --> 04:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
going to kind of like a greatest hits
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
highlight situation so HP 423 primarily
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
it changes the definition of attached
 
04:27:10.969 --> 04:27:10.979 align:start position:0%
from the and this is something that
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
Newmarket specifically adopted
 
04:27:16.490 --> 04:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
um from specifically attached to also
 
04:27:18.410 --> 04:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
include completely contained within a
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
pre-existing detached structure and then
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
says that you have the right to have
 
04:27:29.090 --> 04:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
your one at least one Adu detached and
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
then the town may require that the
 
04:27:34.370 --> 04:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
second Adu have by right be attached by
 
04:27:36.130 --> 04:27:36.140 align:start position:0%
this new definition
 
04:27:38.170 --> 04:27:38.180 align:start position:0%
it also
 
04:27:42.290 --> 04:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
increases the square footage that a town
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
can restrict down to from 750 to a
 
04:27:48.410 --> 04:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
thousand for one and 850 for any other
 
04:27:51.530 --> 04:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
Adu I did hear you say specifically
 
04:27:54.110 --> 04:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
Newmarket wanted to also say no more
 
04:27:55.870 --> 04:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
than 80 percent of the
 
04:27:59.210 --> 04:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
primary residents
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and then another thing that we have
 
04:28:02.689 --> 04:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
here is
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
um the re the ability for the
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
municipality to require one of those two
 
04:28:10.490 --> 04:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
adus to meet Workforce housing
 
04:28:10.500 --> 04:28:12.649 align:start position:0%
adus to meet Workforce housing
requirements

04:28:12.649 --> 04:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:28:14.570 --> 04:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and I had spoken about this earlier
 
04:28:17.210 --> 04:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
but the idea behind that was twofold not
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
only to get to affordable housing
 
04:28:21.530 --> 04:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
obviously but also to kind of prevent
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
the um the the problem that has been
 
04:28:26.570 --> 04:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
raised of people building Aid use
 
04:28:29.929 --> 04:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
specifically for short-term rentals
 
04:28:32.929 --> 04:28:32.939 align:start position:0%
um and then I did add at the end here
 
04:28:35.090 --> 04:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
the ability for municipality to require
 
04:28:37.729 --> 04:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
a lot size of no more than a half acre
 
04:28:41.090 --> 04:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
for the second Adu and finally the the
 
04:28:43.250 --> 04:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
last thing this is in the bill but that
 
04:28:46.250 --> 04:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
has been raised is the idea of
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
um of addressing the parking
 
04:28:51.889 --> 04:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
requirements because many I wasn't aware
 
04:28:53.450 --> 04:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
of this I don't know that this has been
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
an issue in New Market but here we hear
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
that many municipalities have had
 
04:29:00.170 --> 04:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
onerous parking requirements on their
 
04:29:03.170 --> 04:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
Adu uh the one that exists by right um
 
04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
as kind of an effective way of denying
 
04:29:07.729 --> 04:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
adus so those are kind of the highlights
 
04:29:10.010 --> 04:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
and then a couple extra ideas and I just
 
04:29:11.809 --> 04:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
wanted to open it up to you for any of
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on any of those
 
04:29:17.210 --> 04:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
people it was parking um you know as the
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
last thing mentioned so I'll speak to
 
04:29:18.359 --> 04:29:19.130 align:start position:0%
last thing mentioned so I'll speak to
that

04:29:19.130 --> 04:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:19.140 --> 04:29:20.450 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:29:20.450 --> 04:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:22.610 --> 04:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
what Newmarket did was you just had to
 
04:29:24.050 --> 04:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you have enough parking
 
04:29:25.910 --> 04:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
for the primary and accessory dwelling
 
04:29:27.889 --> 04:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
unit the idea was that there's going to
 
04:29:29.090 --> 04:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
be a lot of flexibility in different
 
04:29:29.100 --> 04:29:30.649 align:start position:0%
be a lot of flexibility in different
situations

04:29:30.649 --> 04:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
situations
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
and different contexts so basically the
 
04:29:34.969 --> 04:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
build and inspector or building official
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
go out you know meet with the applicant
 
04:29:40.429 --> 04:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
and the app can either you know with a
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
site plan obviously with the building
 
04:29:41.520 --> 04:29:42.830 align:start position:0%
site plan obviously with the building
permit

04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
permit
 
04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
and to show that Parkinson's sufficient
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
and once that becomes a problem then you
 
04:29:52.130 --> 04:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
know a enforcement order will go out
 
04:29:55.309 --> 04:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
so we don't really require we just say
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you have enough because
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
it could be a five acre lot
 
04:30:02.330 --> 04:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
and you know so or you have a you know
 
04:30:03.889 --> 04:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
smaller lot but you have enough parking
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to be as flexible as
 
04:30:09.229 --> 04:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
possible without being too olderous but
 
04:30:10.849 --> 04:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
understand that we want to make sure
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
parking is provided for so I was
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
approach that we took
 
04:30:15.840 --> 04:30:16.729 align:start position:0%
approach that we took
um

04:30:16.729 --> 04:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:18.889 --> 04:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
just looking at line six
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
um the first page
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
I think that needs to be worked on I
 
04:30:22.560 --> 04:30:23.750 align:start position:0%
I think that needs to be worked on I
think

04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:30:25.729 --> 04:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
it might be redundant you might already
 
04:30:25.739 --> 04:30:27.349 align:start position:0%
it might be redundant you might already
say

04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:30:29.570 --> 04:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
I would just say just if you want to
 
04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
keep it clean may it work on that
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
definition with that new language right
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
there from line six to line seven or
 
04:30:38.689 --> 04:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
just strike it out and then just
 
04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
um speak to it where detached
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
um units are spoken to
 
04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know which section that is
 
04:30:47.159 --> 04:30:48.170 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know which section that is
but

04:30:48.170 --> 04:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:30:48.180 --> 04:30:49.550 align:start position:0%
but
um

04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
I think it's a little confusing
 
04:30:53.330 --> 04:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
so if you want to take a look at that
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
next session
 
04:30:55.439 --> 04:30:57.410 align:start position:0%
next session
um

04:30:57.410 --> 04:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of a thousand square
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
feet this is line 18 19. to and then the
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
second one has to be 850. that goes back
 
04:31:14.809 --> 04:31:14.819 align:start position:0%
to my early come on scale I think that's
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
really important
 
04:31:16.560 --> 04:31:17.210 align:start position:0%
really important
um

04:31:17.210 --> 04:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:21.050 --> 04:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
so I think you um the bill got that
 
04:31:21.060 --> 04:31:23.030 align:start position:0%
so I think you um the bill got that
right

04:31:23.030 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:31:26.809 --> 04:31:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:30.290 --> 04:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
I I do you know
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know be an advocate for Workforce
 
04:31:35.149 --> 04:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
housing too but understand that every
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
Community is going to be different
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
I think right now it's a good first step
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
with may you know require affordable
 
04:31:42.769 --> 04:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
housing because I think that
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
conversation needs to be evolved and
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's got to be slow walk potentially
 
04:31:49.250 --> 04:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of different
 
04:31:49.260 --> 04:31:51.290 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of different
um

04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of different interests in this so
 
04:31:55.610 --> 04:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good first step
 
04:31:58.490 --> 04:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
moving towards that direction
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously I would like to
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
see it more but
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
um there's got to be some compromise
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
04:32:06.720 --> 04:32:07.490 align:start position:0%
there as well
um

04:32:07.490 --> 04:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:07.500 --> 04:32:10.070 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
I like the May and the interior door
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
part I think that's the shallow is too
 
04:32:16.849 --> 04:32:16.859 align:start position:0%
onerous on line 26 sorry I'm jumping
 
04:32:18.290 --> 04:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
around here
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a good Amendment there
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe I had pushback on that
 
04:32:30.889 --> 04:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:32.570 --> 04:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
because the idea is you're going to have
 
04:32:34.309 --> 04:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
the primary dwelling like typically in
 
04:32:36.110 --> 04:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities and I think the statues
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
requires us uh a dozen actually but at
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
least a new market the property owner
 
04:32:42.050 --> 04:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
has to live on lot
 
04:32:44.149 --> 04:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
so you've seen that in a lot of
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
communities so I'm not sure if that's
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
too much
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
but that's why you know leading up to
 
04:32:52.250 --> 04:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
the property owner in that case might be
 
04:32:52.260 --> 04:32:54.469 align:start position:0%
the property owner in that case might be
best

04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
best
 
04:32:54.479 --> 04:32:55.250 align:start position:0%
best
um

04:32:55.250 --> 04:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:58.670 --> 04:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
so the state telling that it has to be
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
because I know what are you trying to
 
04:33:02.510 --> 04:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
achieve I guess no it's fine I just
 
04:33:03.769 --> 04:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
didn't know if there was any I didn't
 
04:33:06.289 --> 04:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
understand the pushback I got on May
 
04:33:07.730 --> 04:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
um instead of shall and I didn't know if
 
04:33:09.051 --> 04:33:09.061 align:start position:0%
there was like if you had heard any
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
other rationale of why we would want to
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
force people to have a door between the
 
04:33:15.600 --> 04:33:17.090 align:start position:0%
force people to have a door between the
two

04:33:17.090 --> 04:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:33:19.131 --> 04:33:19.141 align:start position:0%
you know I wasn't there for that
 
04:33:21.410 --> 04:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
conversation when the statue was first
 
04:33:23.330 --> 04:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
adopted so
 
04:33:23.340 --> 04:33:24.170 align:start position:0%
adopted so
um

04:33:24.170 --> 04:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:26.810 --> 04:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for your
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
expertise and coming to the committee
 
04:33:32.631 --> 04:33:32.641 align:start position:0%
it's been very helpful I'm happy any
 
04:33:35.029 --> 04:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
follow-up too please contact me any
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions thank you very much
 
04:33:43.849 --> 04:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:45.051 --> 04:33:45.061 align:start position:0%
yeah we're gonna take a three minute
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
break and then we're gonna go into our
 
04:34:05.090 --> 04:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.090 --> 04:34:13.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:41.330 --> 04:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
let's do that
 
04:34:55.131 --> 04:34:55.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:25.310 --> 04:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:25.320 --> 04:35:54.250 align:start position:0%
 
suppose

04:35:54.250 --> 04:35:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:57.250 --> 04:35:57.260 align:start position:0%
that's awesome
 
04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:19.150 --> 04:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.449 --> 04:36:23.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.459 --> 04:36:36.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:36:36.490 --> 04:36:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.051 --> 04:36:45.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.061 --> 04:36:54.709 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.719 --> 04:37:02.810 align:start position:0%
 
ready

04:37:02.810 --> 04:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
no I wish I had one I looked him up
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
online and I watched some of the other
 
04:37:14.929 --> 04:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
presenters I didn't notice one utilizing
 
04:37:16.490 --> 04:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
one or I would have
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:47.760 --> 04:37:58.189 align:start position:0%
 
smoothies

04:39:06.410 --> 04:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to get started this special
 
04:39:07.730 --> 04:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
committee on housing I want to welcome
 
04:39:07.740 --> 04:39:09.470 align:start position:0%
committee on housing I want to welcome
up

04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%

04:39:20.209 --> 04:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
I'll turn this to make sure everybody
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
can hear me properly sure first I wanted
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
to say thank you
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for creating the special
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee that focuses on housing needs
 
04:39:29.689 --> 04:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
and thank you for giving me the
 
04:39:31.849 --> 04:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you today
 
04:39:34.250 --> 04:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
I hope we can all agree that housing is
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
a basic human need
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
but the part I think that we are all
 
04:39:39.890 --> 04:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
having trouble with is how to fill this
 
04:39:39.900 --> 04:39:41.270 align:start position:0%
having trouble with is how to fill this
need

04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
in my capacity as a tenant organizer
 
04:39:46.010 --> 04:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
with gsop I have helped many individuals
 
04:39:47.810 --> 04:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
and families by holding a weekly tenant
 
04:39:50.330 --> 04:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
clinic in Manchester New Hampshire this
 
04:39:52.130 --> 04:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
is a space created to help New Hampshire
 
04:39:54.770 --> 04:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
residents find rental assistance utility
 
04:39:57.470 --> 04:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
assistance learn their rights and apply
 
04:39:59.930 --> 04:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
for legal assistance this tenant Clinic
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
started as an eviction Clinic due to the
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelming number of renovation
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
evictions happening across our state
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
one of the best phrases I heard
 
04:40:08.458 --> 04:40:09.890 align:start position:0%
one of the best phrases I heard
unfortunately

04:40:09.890 --> 04:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
in one of our sessions to describe it
 
04:40:14.810 --> 04:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
was I step outside of my apartment and I
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
look to my left and there's a for sale
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
sign and when I look to my right there's
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
a for sale sign everywhere around me is
 
04:40:22.730 --> 04:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
for sale
 
04:40:25.070 --> 04:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
we saw this across multiple price ranges
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
with apartment buildings and houses
 
04:40:29.090 --> 04:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
selling either before they hit the
 
04:40:30.830 --> 04:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
market or just one to three days after
 
04:40:33.288 --> 04:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
showing we saw that our dilapidated
 
04:40:35.630 --> 04:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
housing or what investors call C-Class
 
04:40:37.730 --> 04:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
properties started getting bought up
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
with the head spending speed
 
04:40:42.050 --> 04:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
and as the evictions grew in Number the
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
available affording housing unit started
 
04:40:46.970 --> 04:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
to become harder and harder to find
 
04:40:49.250 --> 04:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming amount of good cause
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
renovation addictions wiped out a large
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
portion of naturally occurring
 
04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
affordable housing across our state
 
04:40:57.650 --> 04:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
coupled with the unprecedented increases
 
04:40:59.930 --> 04:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
in rent brought to the foreground the
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
need for affordable housing
 
04:41:04.250 --> 04:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
those two words affordable housing held
 
04:41:06.110 --> 04:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
such a stigma in our state for so long
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
till now
 
04:41:10.010 --> 04:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
it is a very popular phrase and finally
 
04:41:12.410 --> 04:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
everybody's utilizing it from those of
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
us who need it to those building it it's
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
talked about when variances and
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
exceptions are asked for as a new Hot
 
04:41:20.930 --> 04:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
Topic phrase
 
04:41:23.448 --> 04:41:23.458 align:start position:0%
but those two words are so broad as they
 
04:41:25.610 --> 04:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
are currently defined what I feel is
 
04:41:27.050 --> 04:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
needed is a better look and
 
04:41:28.610 --> 04:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
understanding into the income
 
04:41:31.128 --> 04:41:31.138 align:start position:0%
classifications from HUD which focuses
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
on the area median income or the
 
04:41:35.448 --> 04:41:35.458 align:start position:0%
abbreviation you hear a lot especially
 
04:41:38.750 --> 04:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
for me Ami and that is where we're going
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
to start with the paper that I passed
 
04:41:42.128 --> 04:41:42.138 align:start position:0%
out to everybody
 
04:41:45.890 --> 04:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
I am a Tena organizer with gsop but I am
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
also on the Manchester housing
 
04:41:47.520 --> 04:41:48.530 align:start position:0%
also on the Manchester housing
commission

04:41:48.530 --> 04:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
where I try and help fight for more
 
04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
housing for all and then this we created
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
this form to better help everyone
 
04:41:56.700 --> 04:41:57.890 align:start position:0%
this form to better help everyone
um

04:41:57.890 --> 04:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
we'll go into that so I just wanted to
 
04:42:02.930 --> 04:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
what I feel is needed is a better
 
04:42:06.530 --> 04:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
looking understanding into the income
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
classifications from HUD which focuses
 
04:42:11.448 --> 04:42:11.458 align:start position:0%
on the area median income this chart
 
04:42:15.288 --> 04:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
covers 30 Ami extremely low income all
 
04:42:18.050 --> 04:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
the way to 100 Ami fair market middle
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
income to help you better be able to
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
understand this I have printed up to
 
04:42:23.208 --> 04:42:23.218 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire's quick
 
04:42:25.010 --> 04:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
reference housing guide that was created
 
04:42:27.288 --> 04:42:27.298 align:start position:0%
by our Housing Commission in an effort
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
to help our aldermen zoning and planning
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
board better understand terms use and
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
how they are applied the first part you
 
04:42:36.110 --> 04:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
will see labeled in the lower left hand
 
04:42:38.410 --> 04:42:38.420 align:start position:0%
section of the front page
 
04:42:38.420 --> 04:42:39.948 align:start position:0%
section of the front page
is

04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:42:39.958 --> 04:42:40.730 align:start position:0%
is
um

04:42:40.730 --> 04:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
30 Ami extremely low income
 
04:42:46.490 --> 04:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
what we did with this chart is break it
 
04:42:48.350 --> 04:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
down to show what 30 percent of each
 
04:42:50.208 --> 04:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
income classification would look like
 
04:42:52.610 --> 04:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
since HUD qualifies affordable rent
 
04:42:55.310 --> 04:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
being 30 percent of one's income
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
what that means is for a single
 
04:42:57.240 --> 04:42:58.490 align:start position:0%
what that means is for a single
individual

04:42:58.490 --> 04:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
with the income no higher than 21 000
 
04:43:03.530 --> 04:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
per year
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
what that represents is 525 dollars a
 
04:43:09.050 --> 04:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
month in rent we don't have that
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
and when you have a family of five that
 
04:43:14.930 --> 04:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
is still at 30 Ami extremely low income
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
and their top income is 37 190 a year
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
for a five-person household what that
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
means to them is that the only income
 
04:43:25.490 --> 04:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
qualified for a rent of nine hundred and
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
thirty dollars a month most boarding
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
rooms and Studios charge this much if
 
04:43:31.730 --> 04:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
not more but yet five people in a studio
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
apartment or a boarding room would
 
04:43:35.570 --> 04:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
surpass occupancy levels allowed due to
 
04:43:35.580 --> 04:43:36.530 align:start position:0%
surpass occupancy levels allowed due to
size

04:43:36.530 --> 04:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
size
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
I've seen families have to split up one
 
04:43:42.410 --> 04:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
family I helped ended up with the mother
 
04:43:44.330 --> 04:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
and two children in Tilton
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
with family and the father and their
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
other two children stayed in Manchester
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
where he held a job
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
that is not the only family this has
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
happened to and it's not the furthest
 
04:43:56.330 --> 04:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
people have had to go to find housing
 
04:43:58.670 --> 04:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
these two areas need to be highlighted
 
04:44:03.410 --> 04:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
and uplifted 30 Ami and 50 Ami because
 
04:44:06.170 --> 04:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
we do not have rents to meet their needs
 
04:44:08.690 --> 04:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
we just don't have it unless it's under
 
04:44:10.930 --> 04:44:10.940 align:start position:0%
HUD or housing
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
supported housing models the private
 
04:44:16.310 --> 04:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
landlords can't offer rent like that now
 
04:44:18.590 --> 04:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
and what we can see as we take a look at
 
04:44:19.970 --> 04:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
this chart is that you do not start
 
04:44:22.010 --> 04:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
seeing realistic rent amounts until we
 
04:44:24.288 --> 04:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
get closer to 60 and 80 percent area
 
04:44:27.050 --> 04:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
median income I try to explain to those
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
that may not understand that those at 80
 
04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
and 100 Ami may not always like the
 
04:44:34.490 --> 04:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
cheaper more affordable apartments but
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
yet they are still an option for them
 
04:44:38.810 --> 04:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
whereas those at 30 and 50 percent area
 
04:44:41.690 --> 04:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
median income have their only uh have
 
04:44:44.270 --> 04:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
only their options since they cannot
 
04:44:47.390 --> 04:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
afford more expensive units thus making
 
04:44:49.368 --> 04:44:49.378 align:start position:0%
their options much more limited and
 
04:44:51.770 --> 04:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
scarce this leads to a multitude of
 
04:44:53.930 --> 04:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
other services needing to be utilized to
 
04:44:55.970 --> 04:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
keep them housed while they wait for an
 
04:44:57.708 --> 04:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
available unit in their range to become
 
04:44:57.718 --> 04:44:58.670 align:start position:0%
available unit in their range to become
available

04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:45:01.070 --> 04:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
which leads to my last topic the missing
 
04:45:01.080 --> 04:45:02.390 align:start position:0%
which leads to my last topic the missing
piece

04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
piece
 
04:45:04.368 --> 04:45:04.378 align:start position:0%
right above this section you will see
 
04:45:06.890 --> 04:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
the housing terminology section and at
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the list you'll find
 
04:45:10.190 --> 04:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
this is something greatly needed in
 
04:45:14.330 --> 04:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
multiple communities across our state as
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
as it is not easy to just move to a new
 
04:45:18.650 --> 04:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
affordable apartment
 
04:45:20.990 --> 04:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
it can take six months to a year to
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes find and qualify for these
 
04:45:25.850 --> 04:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing Services can be quite
 
04:45:28.670 --> 04:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
expensive for the municipalities to face
 
04:45:31.250 --> 04:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
on their own since it requires multiple
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
services and non-profits to be able to
 
04:45:36.530 --> 04:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
meet that need currently we need to see
 
04:45:37.930 --> 04:45:37.940 align:start position:0%
an increased funding to the
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities for this goal
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I just want to be able to stop and
 
04:45:45.050 --> 04:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have
 
04:45:48.050 --> 04:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
especially when you look at this it's
 
04:45:49.730 --> 04:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
something that I've seen as the greatest
 
04:45:53.150 --> 04:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
need emerge as I spoke of those at 80
 
04:45:55.368 --> 04:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
and 100 they have much more options
 
04:45:57.890 --> 04:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
available the housing projects I'm
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
seeing coming out if you take a look at
 
04:46:02.208 --> 04:46:02.218 align:start position:0%
Manchester right now what we have on the
 
04:46:02.218 --> 04:46:03.350 align:start position:0%
Manchester right now what we have on the
books

04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
books
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see that
 
04:46:09.050 --> 04:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
1439 units are approved and in progress
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
the number of those being offered below
 
04:46:13.490 --> 04:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
fair market 210.
 
04:46:15.470 --> 04:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
we're not going to meet our current need
 
04:46:17.570 --> 04:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
without more funding and more help with
 
04:46:17.580 --> 04:46:18.350 align:start position:0%
without more funding and more help with
this

04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much um I
 
04:46:22.490 --> 04:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
have just one quick question before I
 
04:46:23.690 --> 04:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
open it up
 
04:46:25.070 --> 04:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
um on the bottom right hand corner of
 
04:46:26.448 --> 04:46:26.458 align:start position:0%
your sheet the current Manchester rental
 
04:46:28.550 --> 04:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
pricing I'm seeing that the fair market
 
04:46:30.530 --> 04:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
rents for Manchester as determined by
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hud is actually
 
04:46:32.520 --> 04:46:34.070 align:start position:0%
Hud is actually
meeting

04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:46:37.490 --> 04:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
the median rent it's keeping up
 
04:46:40.368 --> 04:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
okay as the median rent so I guess I'm
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
wondering like
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
yeah that part gets tricky so that added
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
in for HUD so when we um when someone
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
has a housing Choice voucher those are
 
04:46:52.970 --> 04:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
the rents that they're allowed that
 
04:46:54.770 --> 04:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
fully doesn't represent what rents are
 
04:46:56.208 --> 04:46:56.218 align:start position:0%
being actually offered in Manchester
 
04:46:58.550 --> 04:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
commonly you will see 1600 on a two
 
04:47:00.410 --> 04:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
bedroom and up
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's hard
 
04:47:04.250 --> 04:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
rates right there so if you have a
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
housing Choice voucher that is the rent
 
04:47:09.350 --> 04:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
you have to hit what that also does show
 
04:47:09.360 --> 04:47:10.970 align:start position:0%
you have to hit what that also does show
is

04:47:10.970 --> 04:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:47:10.980 --> 04:47:12.050 align:start position:0%
is
um

04:47:12.050 --> 04:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
we also show the variances in there but
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
which one
 
04:47:18.650 --> 04:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
do you see that it's close
 
04:47:20.030 --> 04:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
well I was like thinking for a two
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
bedroom the fair market rent as
 
04:47:24.350 --> 04:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
determined by Hud is 1646. yeah the
 
04:47:26.330 --> 04:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
actual median rent is 1582 so it doesn't
 
04:47:26.340 --> 04:47:27.350 align:start position:0%
actual median rent is 1582 so it doesn't
seem

04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
seem
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
to me like
 
04:47:30.770 --> 04:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
do you see the key part in that missing
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
the Amis to your left that's how um
 
04:47:34.970 --> 04:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's why I honestly I didn't really
 
04:47:36.288 --> 04:47:36.298 align:start position:0%
agree with having this part in there
 
04:47:38.090 --> 04:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't fully represent that
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
these are HUD prices only I think I'm
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
going to take that back to the
 
04:47:42.170 --> 04:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
commission and let them know that we do
 
04:47:43.550 --> 04:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
need to
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
label this better because that does get
 
04:47:46.080 --> 04:47:47.650 align:start position:0%
label this better because that does get
confusing

04:47:47.650 --> 04:47:47.660 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
I know a lot about housing after sitting
 
04:47:51.590 --> 04:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
through these meetings and that's why I
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
was like very confused by that chart so
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so um and that's the other hard
 
04:47:58.010 --> 04:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
part is getting the rent slow enough for
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
their vouchers to be able to exist there
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs thank you
 
04:48:03.840 --> 04:48:04.730 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs thank you
um

04:48:04.730 --> 04:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:06.590 --> 04:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
as I recall
 
04:48:09.230 --> 04:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
um Hud's income limit classifications
 
04:48:13.250 --> 04:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
are done by County so uh the income
 
04:48:15.050 --> 04:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
classifications that you have in the
 
04:48:17.868 --> 04:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
lower left hand Square rectangle
 
04:48:19.250 --> 04:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
um are those for Hillsborough County
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
correct it'd be all are centered around
 
04:48:21.600 --> 04:48:22.910 align:start position:0%
correct it'd be all are centered around
Manchester

04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it should be Hillsborough
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
County because they're all centered on
 
04:48:28.670 --> 04:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
marriage right right so say if I were
 
04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
looking at Merrimack or Rockingham
 
04:48:31.670 --> 04:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
County they would be different yes yes
 
04:48:33.288 --> 04:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
thank you slightly
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey
 
04:48:38.448 --> 04:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
uh chairman and thank you for pulling
 
04:48:40.128 --> 04:48:40.138 align:start position:0%
this together as the chairman mentioned
 
04:48:42.770 --> 04:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
we've seen this chart done 20 different
 
04:48:45.650 --> 04:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
ways I like your approach thank you this
 
04:48:47.868 --> 04:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
I have to give credit to Katie she's
 
04:48:49.810 --> 04:48:49.820 align:start position:0%
also on our Housing Commission Marquis
 
04:48:52.610 --> 04:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
she really she took up quite a few
 
04:48:54.110 --> 04:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
months to put this together we had many
 
04:48:56.208 --> 04:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
meetings back and forth thank you thank
 
04:48:57.890 --> 04:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
you a lot of work
 
04:49:00.050 --> 04:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have questions
 
04:49:01.850 --> 04:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much oh
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:13.850 --> 04:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
related to
 
04:49:18.410 --> 04:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
the income classifications which of
 
04:49:20.448 --> 04:49:20.458 align:start position:0%
those in classifications qualify for
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
Section 8
 
04:49:25.970 --> 04:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
or is it you're up to 50 Ami when you're
 
04:49:28.128 --> 04:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
looking at um for housing Choice
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
vouchers it's up to 50 Ami
 
04:49:33.530 --> 04:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:49:36.890 --> 04:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
sorry uh it's considered low income and
 
04:49:38.810 --> 04:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
very low income
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
um which uh is as you said 30 percent
 
04:49:45.170 --> 04:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
and and fifty percent wow um for HUD
 
04:49:47.930 --> 04:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
actually 80 is considered to be moderate
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
income uh at least as as they were doing
 
04:49:50.638 --> 04:49:51.948 align:start position:0%
income uh at least as as they were doing
it

04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:49:55.310 --> 04:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
um up until 2016 which was uh when I
 
04:49:57.410 --> 04:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
retired from mud right you and me both
 
04:49:59.390 --> 04:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
agree that that's what low income is is
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
30 and 50 but unfortunately we have this
 
04:50:05.448 --> 04:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
to go by is what they qualify 80 Ami is
 
04:50:07.850 --> 04:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
considered low income also and when
 
04:50:11.770 --> 04:50:11.780 align:start position:0%
you're looking at 80 Ami one person 55
 
04:50:15.050 --> 04:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
950 they're going to qualify for that
 
04:50:17.208 --> 04:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
one bedroom apartment long before I will
 
04:50:20.270 --> 04:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
at my lower thirty percent Ami
 
04:50:20.280 --> 04:50:21.110 align:start position:0%
at my lower thirty percent Ami
um

04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:21.120 --> 04:50:22.670 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:50:22.670 --> 04:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:25.850 --> 04:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
my options are very minimal whereas
 
04:50:29.090 --> 04:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
somebody at 80 Ami can go all the way
 
04:50:31.368 --> 04:50:31.378 align:start position:0%
down the board if they must and they can
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
wait for the other apartments to come
 
04:50:35.868 --> 04:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
along but those of us at 30 and 50 we
 
04:50:37.250 --> 04:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
can't wait because we're out on the
 
04:50:37.260 --> 04:50:38.570 align:start position:0%
can't wait because we're out on the
streets

04:50:38.570 --> 04:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
streets
 
04:50:40.910 --> 04:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
um we have nowhere to go there's not
 
04:50:42.788 --> 04:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
enough places the tenants I help
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
routinely take six months to a year and
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
they try hard they're calling every day
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
we're creating worksheets we're getting
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
inventive I help tenants put together a
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
tenant resume to help them stand out we
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
are trying everything and it just takes
 
04:51:00.410 --> 04:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
time A real estate agent will tell you
 
04:51:01.970 --> 04:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
look at hundreds of calls on a low
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
income a truly low income of 30 or 80
 
04:51:07.730 --> 04:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
percent you'll get multiple those that
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
are renting a couple thousand and up
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
five to twenty
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
that is the difference in the need
 
04:51:17.690 --> 04:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
and that is the difference in what is
 
04:51:19.128 --> 04:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
available out there
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
and we desperately need something for
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
thirty percent and fifty percent even if
 
04:51:26.930 --> 04:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's a supportive model such as
 
04:51:29.448 --> 04:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
um Supportive Housing
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
creating we saw the hotels were great
 
04:51:36.530 --> 04:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
then Heap program is over we don't have
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
that catch anymore so we have to get
 
04:51:40.970 --> 04:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
busy and create some type of Supportive
 
04:51:43.250 --> 04:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
Housing need to meet that until they're
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
able to find something because with
 
04:51:47.330 --> 04:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
enough hard work they will we get enough
 
04:51:50.090 --> 04:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
places built they also will but there's
 
04:51:53.448 --> 04:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
also uplifting helping raise their
 
04:51:55.970 --> 04:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
income to meet to be able to qualify
 
04:51:58.490 --> 04:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
finding the resources they need to fill
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to qualify getting them on
 
04:52:03.170 --> 04:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
list and being able to wait somewhere
 
04:52:05.810 --> 04:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
for your voucher to become available all
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
these things are important and if we
 
04:52:10.368 --> 04:52:10.378 align:start position:0%
work together those could be done and
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'd rather put our money into uplifting
 
04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
others instead of just getting by on the
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
side with the shelter
 
04:52:18.770 --> 04:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Miss Parkinson I
 
04:52:21.530 --> 04:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate it any other questions
 
04:52:22.970 --> 04:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
04:52:25.250 --> 04:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative Delorenzo thank you Mr
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:52:29.208 --> 04:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
um so when we look at Supportive Housing
 
04:52:31.550 --> 04:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
does that include transitional housing
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
yes um a supportive model would have
 
04:52:37.910 --> 04:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
something that would cover your income
 
04:52:41.090 --> 04:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
resources mental health needs
 
04:52:41.100 --> 04:52:42.050 align:start position:0%
resources mental health needs
um

04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:43.868 --> 04:52:43.878 align:start position:0%
what is the other one
 
04:52:46.250 --> 04:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
recovery needs
 
04:52:46.260 --> 04:52:47.150 align:start position:0%
recovery needs
um

04:52:47.150 --> 04:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:49.730 --> 04:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
educational needs because sometimes
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
people are underemployed and with a
 
04:52:53.690 --> 04:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
little bit of help they can raise their
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
income levels and be able to qualify and
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
get in somewhere so bringing that part
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
back of training
 
04:53:02.890 --> 04:53:02.900 align:start position:0%
um all sorts of stuff like that
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
I the mayor has asked me to put my model
 
04:53:08.448 --> 04:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
together because I have a recycling
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
model like I want to pull in a bank and
 
04:53:12.890 --> 04:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
I want to create an escrow account a
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
savings deposit in a checking account so
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
while they're at this transitional
 
04:53:18.410 --> 04:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
housing 30 percent of their income is
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
going into this escrow account so when
 
04:53:22.010 --> 04:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
they move out they have their own
 
04:53:24.410 --> 04:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
security deposit to be able to reuse the
 
04:53:26.570 --> 04:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
first month's rent all these things
 
04:53:28.550 --> 04:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
because I know this is hard on our state
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to supply and produce
 
04:53:33.050 --> 04:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
but we can create these supportive
 
04:53:35.990 --> 04:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
models and help people with them
 
04:53:38.330 --> 04:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:53:41.690 --> 04:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay I want to um invite up Miss A Jane
 
04:53:43.970 --> 04:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
Haig from Manchester housing Alliance oh
 
04:53:45.530 --> 04:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
um my name is Jane hake and I work with
 
04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
a Manchester housing Alliance which is
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
an informal activist group
 
04:53:53.570 --> 04:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the opportunity to address
 
04:53:55.850 --> 04:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm a retired history
 
04:53:58.910 --> 04:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
Professor now I'm a full-time activist
 
04:54:02.208 --> 04:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
uh my specialty is research I got
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
interested in the housing issues when
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
the homelessness crisis hit Manchester
 
04:54:11.208 --> 04:54:11.218 align:start position:0%
sometime at the end of 2020 which I just
 
04:54:12.890 --> 04:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
thought was appalling
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
and it continues to be appalling so my
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
self-assigned mission has been to
 
04:54:18.770 --> 04:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
understand why we're in a housing crisis
 
04:54:21.230 --> 04:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
how we can get out of it so I've read
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
every report produced by every Committee
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the state I attend every housing
 
04:54:26.270 --> 04:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
meeting all the New Hampshire Housing
 
04:54:28.610 --> 04:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
Finance programs I've watched all this
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
committee's meetings on YouTube and
 
04:54:32.570 --> 04:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
attend all the local Planning and Zoning
 
04:54:32.580 --> 04:54:34.368 align:start position:0%
attend all the local Planning and Zoning
meetings

04:54:34.368 --> 04:54:34.378 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:54:36.288 --> 04:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
um I have been very impressed with the
 
04:54:38.208 --> 04:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
breadth and depth of experience of the
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
members of this particular committee
 
04:54:44.208 --> 04:54:44.218 align:start position:0%
especially the depth of experience and
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
the breadth and the various aspects of
 
04:54:47.390 --> 04:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
the housing market and the Housing
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
Industry I have to tell you there's some
 
04:54:51.410 --> 04:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
naysayers that are out there that are
 
04:54:52.788 --> 04:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
going like I don't know what they can do
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
but I keep telling them that I think
 
04:54:57.288 --> 04:54:57.298 align:start position:0%
that developing a consensus about ways
 
04:54:58.850 --> 04:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
to tackle the housing problem here in
 
04:55:02.270 --> 04:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is extremely important
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
so I recently heard from a friend who
 
04:55:05.930 --> 04:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
saw a development going up near her home
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
in Auburn
 
04:55:09.708 --> 04:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
this development was a 55 and older
 
04:55:11.690 --> 04:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
single-family home kind of a condo
 
04:55:13.490 --> 04:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
development where the units were selling
 
04:55:15.170 --> 04:55:15.180 align:start position:0%
for something like six hundred and fifty
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I was appalled um I think we can all
 
04:55:21.890 --> 04:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
agree New Hampshire does not need any
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
more of these developments and that the
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
people who are buying them are probably
 
04:55:26.930 --> 04:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
not from New Hampshire
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
and it may have just sold a house in
 
04:55:32.090 --> 04:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and be buying for cash
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
um yet there's nothing that we can
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
really do to stop the developer from
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
building this type of development if
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
this is what the particular developer
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
who's bought the land thinks that they
 
04:55:44.868 --> 04:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
can make the most money building or just
 
04:55:47.570 --> 04:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
what they feel like building
 
04:55:49.010 --> 04:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
um they're probably selling the units
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
for cash
 
04:55:51.240 --> 04:55:52.310 align:start position:0%
for cash
um

04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:53.930 --> 04:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:55:55.730 --> 04:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
as far as I can see there's nothing in
 
04:55:57.230 --> 04:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
particular that would incentivize the
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
Builder to build Workforce multi-family
 
04:56:02.270 --> 04:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
housing for families of workers
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly why the state has to
 
04:56:07.610 --> 04:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
concern itself with housing
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
so as I've listened to your meetings and
 
04:56:13.730 --> 04:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
contemplated the various issues here are
 
04:56:16.128 --> 04:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
some major issues first of all zoning
 
04:56:18.470 --> 04:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
and financing and affordability you've
 
04:56:20.208 --> 04:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about zoning and I know you
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
all are focused on zoning and it's
 
04:56:24.050 --> 04:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
definitely a huge part of the problem
 
04:56:26.448 --> 04:56:26.458 align:start position:0%
both in the rural areas and in the
 
04:56:28.970 --> 04:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
smaller towns and to a smaller extent in
 
04:56:31.250 --> 04:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
the larger communities like Manchester I
 
04:56:32.690 --> 04:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how excited I was about
 
04:56:35.390 --> 04:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
the zoning Atlas I know we all sort of
 
04:56:37.490 --> 04:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
started out these meetings going like I
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't know where is this happening and
 
04:56:41.930 --> 04:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
fortuitously the atlas has come along at
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
just the right moment I'm not sure if
 
04:56:46.970 --> 04:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
it's actually at its final usable state
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
but I understand that it soon will be
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
um solving zoning issues alone is not
 
04:56:56.270 --> 04:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem that's really
 
04:56:58.010 --> 04:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
the guts of the issue and I think Mr
 
04:57:00.350 --> 04:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
McDonough said that they've passed this
 
04:57:02.930 --> 04:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
Adu new
 
04:57:02.940 --> 04:57:04.150 align:start position:0%
Adu new
um

04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
availability in Newmarket and yet
 
04:57:08.690 --> 04:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
nobody's built in Adu because nobody can
 
04:57:10.490 --> 04:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
afford to
 
04:57:13.490 --> 04:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I priced one myself or my house
 
04:57:16.250 --> 04:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be at least 150 or
 
04:57:18.530 --> 04:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know maybe more two hundred thousand
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
dollars to put in an Adu uh my friend
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
who's the Adu specialist in Manchester
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
tells me that most of the adus are sort
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
of a multi a family thing where there's
 
04:57:30.120 --> 04:57:31.610 align:start position:0%
of a multi a family thing where there's
a

04:57:31.610 --> 04:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
children and parents and the parents
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
sell their house they put their money
 
04:57:37.250 --> 04:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
into the Adu at the Children's House
 
04:57:40.430 --> 04:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's not people going out and building a
 
04:57:43.010 --> 04:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
rental unit for the General Market at
 
04:57:43.020 --> 04:57:44.230 align:start position:0%
rental unit for the General Market at
all

04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:57:47.810 --> 04:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
so that's not really
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
um changing zoning so smaller houses can
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
be built on smaller Lots is going to
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
help the housing affordability but it's
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
not by itself going to solve the problem
 
04:58:00.770 --> 04:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
unless median income buyers can get
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
financing from local banks
 
04:58:06.730 --> 04:58:06.740 align:start position:0%
and to check this proposition
 
04:58:10.190 --> 04:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
I Googled on you know Banks tightening
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
up lending requirements and if you
 
04:58:13.910 --> 04:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
Google on it you'll get about four pages
 
04:58:16.850 --> 04:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
of results of recent news articles on
 
04:58:19.490 --> 04:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
how banks are tightening Lending and I
 
04:58:21.110 --> 04:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
think that that's one reason I think
 
04:58:23.208 --> 04:58:23.218 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned this earlier today
 
04:58:27.650 --> 04:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
I was watching on YouTube uh that the
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
local Builders aren't building it's out
 
04:58:30.770 --> 04:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
of state builders that are coming in and
 
04:58:32.330 --> 04:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
building these multi-family projects and
 
04:58:34.250 --> 04:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's because they have access to
 
04:58:37.250 --> 04:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
to bigger funds of pots of money they
 
04:58:39.948 --> 04:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
have more access to to loans and and to
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
money to build bigger projects
 
04:58:44.448 --> 04:58:44.458 align:start position:0%
and I think that's how we got into this
 
04:58:45.770 --> 04:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
in the first place is that Banks
 
04:58:48.170 --> 04:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
tightened up lending after the 2008
 
04:58:50.330 --> 04:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and only loan to people
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
with Superior Credit
 
04:58:55.430 --> 04:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
Records who could buy the big mcmansions
 
04:58:57.530 --> 04:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
and that's what Builders build Builders
 
04:58:59.930 --> 04:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
will build what there's a market for
 
04:59:01.970 --> 04:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
and the market has been for larger
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
houses not for Workforce housing because
 
04:59:05.270 --> 04:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
people with
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
not so great credit or maybe just lower
 
04:59:09.350 --> 04:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
incomes weren't getting the money to be
 
04:59:11.208 --> 04:59:11.218 align:start position:0%
able to buy a house
 
04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
so due to these many problems Builders
 
04:59:16.250 --> 04:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
are not capable of meeting the need
 
04:59:18.170 --> 04:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
either for single-family multi-family
 
04:59:21.050 --> 04:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
rentals or townhouse and condos that
 
04:59:23.930 --> 04:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
make up the middle of the market
 
04:59:26.030 --> 04:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I understand that we need Builders
 
04:59:27.708 --> 04:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
and developers to build housing I'm not
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
against developers but and developers
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
need to make a profit
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
but as I said they haven't been building
 
04:59:35.690 --> 04:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
this housing because they can't get
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
financing because the buyers can't get
 
04:59:37.680 --> 04:59:39.350 align:start position:0%
financing because the buyers can't get
financing

04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
financing
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
so I think we're talking about a math
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
problem here it's not a complicated
 
04:59:45.410 --> 04:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
algorithm it's just I think you had the
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
Dover Planner on who mentioned 205
 
04:59:50.510 --> 04:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
dollars I'm sure everybody that stuck
 
04:59:52.730 --> 04:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
with everybody right that has like 205
 
04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
dollars a square foot I used to do some
 
04:59:56.448 --> 04:59:56.458 align:start position:0%
building too back when it was a hundred
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
dollars a square foot I don't know if
 
05:00:00.128 --> 05:00:00.138 align:start position:0%
anybody remembers of those days
 
05:00:02.570 --> 05:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
but anyway uh
 
05:00:06.050 --> 05:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
that was a much better number uh
 
05:00:08.810 --> 05:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
so a builder cannot build a house for
 
05:00:12.530 --> 05:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
205 a square foot plus the utilities and
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
the lot and sell it
 
05:00:17.628 --> 05:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
to someone
 
05:00:21.470 --> 05:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
for a rent or mortgage that equals 30 of
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
the median income
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know who's whose income is 100 of
 
05:00:28.250 --> 05:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
the median in this state they it just
 
05:00:29.930 --> 05:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't work it just doesn't doesn't
 
05:00:31.610 --> 05:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
really work out
 
05:00:35.208 --> 05:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
and that's why uh I mean right now we're
 
05:00:37.128 --> 05:00:37.138 align:start position:0%
looking at private sector developers who
 
05:00:38.810 --> 05:00:38.820 align:start position:0%
find and purchase the property et cetera
 
05:00:38.820 --> 05:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
find and purchase the property et cetera
Etc

05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
05:00:39.840 --> 05:00:41.150 align:start position:0%
Etc
so

05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:41.160 --> 05:00:42.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:44.208 --> 05:00:44.218 align:start position:0%
how are we going to dig this out I mean
 
05:00:47.390 --> 05:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
zoning is important but adus are not
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
going to get us out of this problem
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to build enough of them
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
um affordable housing there are very few
 
05:00:56.570 --> 05:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
avenues for potential developers to
 
05:00:59.090 --> 05:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
build affordable housing and as I said
 
05:01:01.628 --> 05:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
there's a fundamental disconnect
 
05:01:03.890 --> 05:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
philosophically between housing as a
 
05:01:06.650 --> 05:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
human right as Jessica mentioned
 
05:01:09.770 --> 05:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
and I think it damages us all morally
 
05:01:11.810 --> 05:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
when we see people living in motels and
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
on the streets and in tents and in their
 
05:01:16.250 --> 05:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
cars I mean if Society exists for any
 
05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
purpose at all it's to make sure the
 
05:01:21.288 --> 05:01:21.298 align:start position:0%
least Among Us have what they need for a
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
minimal respectable existence
 
05:01:25.680 --> 05:01:27.230 align:start position:0%
minimal respectable existence
um

05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:30.288 --> 05:01:30.298 align:start position:0%
I think that only non-profit developers
 
05:01:32.030 --> 05:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
can bridge the gap
 
05:01:34.010 --> 05:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
with local Regional and Statewide
 
05:01:36.170 --> 05:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
non-profits developing affordable and
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing
 
05:01:39.230 --> 05:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have to consider
 
05:01:41.448 --> 05:01:41.458 align:start position:0%
financing including grants and tax
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
credits and towns have to designate
 
05:01:46.250 --> 05:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
areas where multi-family and affordable
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:50.760 --> 05:01:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:51.840 --> 05:01:54.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:56.330 --> 05:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I think you're not
 
05:01:57.890 --> 05:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
sure we've talked about is using State
 
05:01:59.650 --> 05:01:59.660 align:start position:0%
and County Land
 
05:02:01.850 --> 05:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
recently the state released the land
 
05:02:04.030 --> 05:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
from the Laconia
 
05:02:09.050 --> 05:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
hospital or school and in an RFP deal
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
I think they actually could have done a
 
05:02:12.530 --> 05:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
better deal with more affordable housing
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
but I think that they wrote the RFP
 
05:02:16.730 --> 05:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
probably five years ago or something
 
05:02:19.550 --> 05:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
but there's County Land the Hillsborough
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
County still has a 300 acres left over
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
from that the nursing home which was the
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
poor farm which I don't know if you've
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
heard about but I'm sure the other
 
05:02:28.970 --> 05:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
Counties have land as well
 
05:02:31.070 --> 05:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
and as far as I know they have taken no
 
05:02:33.230 --> 05:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
steps at all to release any of this they
 
05:02:35.030 --> 05:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
could be doing rfps
 
05:02:37.730 --> 05:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
for affordable housing projects on on
 
05:02:39.530 --> 05:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
that kind of land
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:02:43.430 --> 05:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing is I think you've heard
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
about manufactured home parks being a
 
05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
part of our affordable housing
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
landscape here in New Hampshire
 
05:02:49.320 --> 05:02:50.628 align:start position:0%
landscape here in New Hampshire
especially

05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
especially
 
05:02:52.490 --> 05:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
I have to say I was very upset when the
 
05:02:53.890 --> 05:02:53.900 align:start position:0%
guy came here and said you know
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
manufactured home parks just are for
 
05:02:58.970 --> 05:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
those kind of people and we don't really
 
05:03:00.530 --> 05:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
need them because I think new
 
05:03:02.510 --> 05:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
manufactured home parks
 
05:03:04.970 --> 05:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
could be a part of the solution in
 
05:03:06.410 --> 05:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state where we
 
05:03:08.208 --> 05:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
happen to have the land
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I also ran into this very
 
05:03:14.030 --> 05:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
interesting situation
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
the other day when I was looking at
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
realtor.com and I set it for looking at
 
05:03:21.288 --> 05:03:21.298 align:start position:0%
the lowest possible priced land or lot
 
05:03:22.970 --> 05:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
that you could get in the state I don't
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
know if you've tried this representative
 
05:03:27.288 --> 05:03:27.298 align:start position:0%
yocella but it was thirteen thousand
 
05:03:27.298 --> 05:03:28.250 align:start position:0%
yocella but it was thirteen thousand
dollars

05:03:28.250 --> 05:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:03:30.890 --> 05:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
and I think it was probably a tenth of
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
an acre because there is a lot of these
 
05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
little subdivisions usually around Lakes
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
that were subdivided in the 60s is that
 
05:03:40.920 --> 05:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
that were subdivided in the 60s is that
right

05:03:41.990 --> 05:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:03:44.448 --> 05:03:44.458 align:start position:0%
and the problem is that they all have
 
05:03:46.368 --> 05:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
restrictions which we might have called
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
covenants I've been trying to get a
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
realtor to talk to me about this and I
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
can't get anybody to say boo
 
05:03:54.590 --> 05:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
um but they have these restrictions
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
about whether you can build there you
 
05:03:58.128 --> 05:03:58.138 align:start position:0%
can't build there or you have to have a
 
05:04:00.770 --> 05:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
septic system or you can only live there
 
05:04:00.780 --> 05:04:01.730 align:start position:0%
septic system or you can only live there
and

05:04:01.730 --> 05:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
in the summer and you have to take your
 
05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
place off in the winter you can't live
 
05:04:08.930 --> 05:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
there year round it has to be more than
 
05:04:10.970 --> 05:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
a thousand square feet it can't be more
 
05:04:13.190 --> 05:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
than a thousand square feet and this is
 
05:04:16.250 --> 05:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
a real untapped resource I think
 
05:04:17.690 --> 05:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a lot of young
 
05:04:19.368 --> 05:04:19.378 align:start position:0%
people in the state that are graduating
 
05:04:21.170 --> 05:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
from college and living in apartments
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
when they would rather be living or they
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
could be living someplace and uh and be
 
05:04:27.948 --> 05:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
building some equity
 
05:04:30.530 --> 05:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
so I think that nobody's really
 
05:04:35.330 --> 05:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
investigated that at all
 
05:04:38.690 --> 05:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
I just started like last week
 
05:04:40.490 --> 05:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's really an interesting
 
05:04:43.970 --> 05:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
resource and to go with it I would
 
05:04:45.650 --> 05:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
suggest uh
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
one of these companies there's one in
 
05:04:50.090 --> 05:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
Maine called it's runs anyway it's
 
05:04:53.330 --> 05:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
backyard Adu company and they prefab
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
these buildings and come in with a crane
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
and drop them onto your site with a very
 
05:05:00.890 --> 05:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
Innovative Foundation system
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
and if the dec would actually allow
 
05:05:06.650 --> 05:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
composting toilets you could solve your
 
05:05:06.660 --> 05:05:07.850 align:start position:0%
composting toilets you could solve your
whole

05:05:07.850 --> 05:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
whole
 
05:05:11.690 --> 05:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
septic problem right there
 
05:05:13.970 --> 05:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's that's I'm done thank you great
 
05:05:15.170 --> 05:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace then
 
05:05:15.180 --> 05:05:16.430 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace then
representative

05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:05:18.530 --> 05:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
um would you be surprised at composting
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
toilets are approved title V throughout
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
the country
 
05:05:24.350 --> 05:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would be surprised what about
 
05:05:25.850 --> 05:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are they approved here yes
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
yes really yes oh thank you very much
 
05:05:35.570 --> 05:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative Conkey
 
05:05:37.970 --> 05:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
um thoughtful conversation I appreciate
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
that you had mentioned Hillsborough
 
05:05:44.930 --> 05:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
County was it Hillsborough County that
 
05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
has 300 acres of County Land as far as I
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.650 --> 05:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
really and we are working we're in the
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
early stages but we're working with the
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
town because unless it's a County
 
05:06:11.150 --> 05:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
facility then you have to abide by all
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
of the regulations but I think we have a
 
05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
willing town over a year's time with
 
05:06:19.610 --> 05:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
zoning to actually come up with a
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
footprint that makes sense well that's
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
what I that's what I found out talking
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
to representative long Pat long as a
 
05:06:28.010 --> 05:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
matter of fact that everyone who from
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County who's in the
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
legislature here is on this committee
 
05:06:33.470 --> 05:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
right and the same for Carroll County
 
05:06:36.288 --> 05:06:36.298 align:start position:0%
who who is on the committee that governs
 
05:06:38.930 --> 05:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and they have the
 
05:06:42.530 --> 05:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
power to release this land I guess
 
05:06:44.930 --> 05:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
well I'm really glad to hear that maybe
 
05:06:47.690 --> 05:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
you could set a pattern for the rest of
 
05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:06:49.798 --> 05:06:51.410 align:start position:0%
the state
yeah

05:06:51.410 --> 05:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:06:53.390 --> 05:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:54.890 --> 05:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for Miss
 
05:06:57.288 --> 05:06:57.298 align:start position:0%
hate representative Reed and then
 
05:06:57.298 --> 05:06:59.270 align:start position:0%
hate representative Reed and then
representative

05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
well I wanted to ask you um
 
05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about
 
05:07:04.320 --> 05:07:05.030 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about
um

05:07:05.030 --> 05:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:09.410 --> 05:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
the county land that could be available
 
05:07:09.420 --> 05:07:10.730 align:start position:0%
the county land that could be available
um

05:07:10.730 --> 05:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
just sit for an instant would you
 
05:07:15.410 --> 05:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
believe that Rockingham County
 
05:07:17.810 --> 05:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
um our County Complex is in Brentwood
 
05:07:20.330 --> 05:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
but there's no transportation out there
 
05:07:23.628 --> 05:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
no well transportation and I think that
 
05:07:26.150 --> 05:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
um our planning board chair
 
05:07:28.510 --> 05:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
um Bryce kawo
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned that transportation and
 
05:07:33.410 --> 05:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
housing are really like linked together
 
05:07:35.090 --> 05:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
and that if you don't have
 
05:07:37.628 --> 05:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
transportation you can hardly build
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
affordable housing but you could
 
05:07:43.610 --> 05:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
Institute some kind of shuttle bus that
 
05:07:45.890 --> 05:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
that served a particular piece of
 
05:07:48.170 --> 05:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
property or particular subdivision or
 
05:07:48.180 --> 05:07:49.190 align:start position:0%
property or particular subdivision or
particular

05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:07:52.850 --> 05:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
development I suppose I I don't know
 
05:07:54.770 --> 05:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
maybe you guys ought to have a
 
05:07:56.330 --> 05:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
transportation committee next year
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
special house committee on
 
05:07:59.208 --> 05:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
Transportation that you would contact
 
05:08:00.970 --> 05:08:00.980 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
05:08:03.770 --> 05:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
we have now four committees so I don't
 
05:08:05.090 --> 05:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
know how many more special committees we
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
um representative thank you Mr chair
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your your presentation and
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just going to kind of
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
because we've talked a lot and my
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
colleagues know how much I love adus but
 
05:08:20.030 --> 05:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
I've never said it's a Magic Bullet it
 
05:08:21.530 --> 05:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
to me it's I'm excited about because
 
05:08:23.930 --> 05:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
it's low hanging fruit whereas all these
 
05:08:25.610 --> 05:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
other things are going to require a lot
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
more this seems like a no doubt but all
 
05:08:29.448 --> 05:08:29.458 align:start position:0%
these other things require a lot more
 
05:08:31.970 --> 05:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
thought and like money so getting to
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
your point because something I've said
 
05:08:37.010 --> 05:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
before and I said earlier today the
 
05:08:39.288 --> 05:08:39.298 align:start position:0%
issue has Isn't actually technically
 
05:08:43.128 --> 05:08:43.138 align:start position:0%
housing it's affordable housing because
 
05:08:44.690 --> 05:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
and this is a number that's a couple
 
05:08:46.610 --> 05:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
years old now but New Hampshire as of
 
05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
like I think 2020 had 74 empty homes a
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
lot of vacation homes
 
05:08:55.250 --> 05:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
for every homeless person that they had
 
05:08:58.010 --> 05:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
have we have in the state I think that
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
you know that number's probably changed
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
in the last couple years but the point
 
05:09:04.128 --> 05:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
is is that getting to it being an
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
affordable thing right that's that's the
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
focus and when we're working within the
 
05:09:11.628 --> 05:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
free market there's really not so much
 
05:09:14.750 --> 05:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
we can do because it's not as attractive
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
for developers to develop things they're
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
not going to make as much of a profit on
 
05:09:21.770 --> 05:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
and affordable housing isn't going to
 
05:09:24.288 --> 05:09:24.298 align:start position:0%
get them a lot of profit in most cases
 
05:09:25.970 --> 05:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
there are some like little adjustments
 
05:09:28.190 --> 05:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
we can make but that's really the Crux
 
05:09:31.490 --> 05:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
of the issue and so when I I hear you
 
05:09:31.500 --> 05:09:32.510 align:start position:0%
of the issue and so when I I hear you
speaking

05:09:32.510 --> 05:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
05:09:34.550 --> 05:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
the thing that I thought and like tell
 
05:09:36.110 --> 05:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
me if this is what you were getting at
 
05:09:39.890 --> 05:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
or if I'm completely off base is
 
05:09:42.170 --> 05:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
um an idea well I'll just put this out
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:49.490 --> 05:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
instead of in like what if we the state
 
05:09:52.368 --> 05:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
were to actually start doing this for
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
people in that we develop I guess you
 
05:09:56.930 --> 05:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
call it public housing it's not really
 
05:09:58.250 --> 05:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
public housing because the idea is that
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
we would be the developer and we would
 
05:10:02.090 --> 05:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
sell it and we would sell it not at
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
profit right and we would approve people
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
because we would also be the lender and
 
05:10:08.510 --> 05:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
we would approve people it's almost like
 
05:10:11.208 --> 05:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
Habitat for Humanity almost where we're
 
05:10:13.490 --> 05:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
like I think we're I I understand you're
 
05:10:14.930 --> 05:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
trying to ask this question but I think
 
05:10:17.570 --> 05:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
we're looking less of government
 
05:10:19.730 --> 05:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
takeover of the entire house well I know
 
05:10:22.930 --> 05:10:22.940 align:start position:0%
you are I know you are
 
05:10:25.490 --> 05:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
that was a question for me I have a
 
05:10:28.250 --> 05:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
comment actually and my comment is that
 
05:10:30.288 --> 05:10:30.298 align:start position:0%
my thought was that we set up a New
 
05:10:32.510 --> 05:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Bank that finances
 
05:10:34.730 --> 05:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
housing and that we're very well set up
 
05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
for that because we have New Hampshire
 
05:10:36.298 --> 05:10:37.550 align:start position:0%
for that because we have New Hampshire
Finance

05:10:37.550 --> 05:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
they're already organized all they need
 
05:10:42.350 --> 05:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
is Frost in the back yeah oh I didn't
 
05:10:42.360 --> 05:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
is Frost in the back yeah oh I didn't
realize

05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
realize
 
05:10:45.890 --> 05:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
well but that's kind of what I suggest
 
05:10:47.930 --> 05:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
but I mean I think that that that
 
05:10:50.810 --> 05:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
putting more money and I also I disagree
 
05:10:52.850 --> 05:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
with you on we actually do need more
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
market rate housing something to the
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
nature of 90 000 units in the next 30 or
 
05:10:59.750 --> 05:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
40 years all together and I think that
 
05:10:59.760 --> 05:11:01.010 align:start position:0%
40 years all together and I think that
includes

05:11:01.010 --> 05:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
includes
 
05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
some market rate housing as well but
 
05:11:05.208 --> 05:11:05.218 align:start position:0%
that apparently I think it's going to be
 
05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to finance that as well
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
so I mean I don't I'm not an expert on
 
05:11:12.530 --> 05:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance but I mean that's what I
 
05:11:14.690 --> 05:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
was kind of suggesting was in a not a
 
05:11:16.550 --> 05:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
Total Takeover of the entire housing
 
05:11:17.930 --> 05:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
market but the point is there are people
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
who are underserved and if you have a
 
05:11:22.610 --> 05:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
system that is inherently not for profit
 
05:11:25.730 --> 05:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
as government is then you can come in
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
and serve that community that is
 
05:11:30.350 --> 05:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
unserved by the market forces but we
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
also we have also in the state a very
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
robust group of non-profit housing
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
developers that are mostly under the
 
05:11:39.410 --> 05:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
neighbor works
 
05:11:42.890 --> 05:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
rubric but also some others that are and
 
05:11:45.590 --> 05:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
and also we're trying to start a housing
 
05:11:48.650 --> 05:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
Land Trust in which we would buy the
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
Manchester housing Alliance Land Trust
 
05:11:53.690 --> 05:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
in which we would own the property and
 
05:11:56.270 --> 05:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
Lease the house on it
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
for 99 years
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the to the to the resident and then
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
the resident would be paying a mortgage
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
on something less than the total value
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the property and for a multi-family
 
05:12:10.970 --> 05:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
house it could be a co-op that has a
 
05:12:12.410 --> 05:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
Master Lease
 
05:12:14.570 --> 05:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
on the building
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
and but the land trust would continue to
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
own the property which is actually sort
 
05:12:22.610 --> 05:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
of the model that these Co-op
 
05:12:24.890 --> 05:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
manufactured home parks operate under
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and I have I have the intention of
 
05:12:30.910 --> 05:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
inviting people to this committee to
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
discuss that as well yeah I'm the
 
05:12:34.850 --> 05:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
president of land trust as well
 
05:12:34.860 --> 05:12:35.990 align:start position:0%
president of land trust as well
obviously

05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
05:12:38.330 --> 05:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
we just started like last month so well
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for your
 
05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
presentation and if anybody has any more
 
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sure you're going to be
 
05:12:42.360 --> 05:12:43.570 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sure you're going to be
here

05:12:43.570 --> 05:12:43.580 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:12:46.430 --> 05:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
05:12:49.010 --> 05:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
all right so I want to move on briefly
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
we have about 50 45 minutes I want to
 
05:12:52.250 --> 05:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
move on just to have a brief a
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
conversation around what we've done so
 
05:12:56.270 --> 05:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
far with housing
 
05:12:58.970 --> 05:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
um potential solutions that we're seeing
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
and maybe you know if the committee is
 
05:13:04.128 --> 05:13:04.138 align:start position:0%
amicable dividing up into smaller
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees to deal with certain parts
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
of legislation and then coming back and
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
presenting it to the full committee so I
 
05:13:11.628 --> 05:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
kind of want to open the floor up I know
 
05:13:13.788 --> 05:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
we discussed Adu I'm sure representative
 
05:13:15.948 --> 05:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
Reed would love to have a group of two
 
05:13:18.230 --> 05:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
or three of us to go through the Adu
 
05:13:19.490 --> 05:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
language and come right back to the
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee but are there other areas of
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
the of this committee or presentations
 
05:13:27.230 --> 05:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to discuss
 
05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
05:13:32.330 --> 05:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
um I guess I I still think we we have to
 
05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
start with zoning
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
um uh financing because obviously
 
05:13:39.890 --> 05:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
crucial as well but you're not going to
 
05:13:42.170 --> 05:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
be able to get financing ever for
 
05:13:43.970 --> 05:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
housing that you can't build because of
 
05:13:46.310 --> 05:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
local regulations
 
05:13:49.788 --> 05:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
um so if we're able to address zoning
 
05:13:49.798 --> 05:13:51.470 align:start position:0%
um so if we're able to address zoning
and

05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:54.050 --> 05:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
um apparently also building codes it
 
05:13:55.970 --> 05:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
seems that the the
 
05:13:58.910 --> 05:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
um uh intent of the State Building Code
 
05:14:01.610 --> 05:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
was to prevent
 
05:14:04.128 --> 05:14:04.138 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:14:06.948 --> 05:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
I don't know quite what what to call it
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
um uh local idiosyncrasies perhaps
 
05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
um but it also seems from what I've been
 
05:14:14.410 --> 05:14:14.420 align:start position:0%
told that there are a lot of local
 
05:14:16.910 --> 05:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
idiosyncrasies out there
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like there there needs
 
05:14:22.250 --> 05:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
to be some control over that
 
05:14:25.430 --> 05:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
um but before we can go anywhere uh we
 
05:14:29.090 --> 05:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
have to determine uh what kind of zoning
 
05:14:32.570 --> 05:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
um is actually reasonable where we have
 
05:14:35.448 --> 05:14:35.458 align:start position:0%
city or town Water and Sewer
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and there are clearly places
 
05:14:40.430 --> 05:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
um where we have City and town Water and
 
05:14:42.770 --> 05:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
Sewer that are still requiring one acre
 
05:14:42.780 --> 05:14:43.970 align:start position:0%
Sewer that are still requiring one acre
lots

05:14:43.970 --> 05:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
lots
 
05:14:46.610 --> 05:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
um and that's not reasonable
 
05:14:49.850 --> 05:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
um and if we need to find ways to
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
improve Water and Sewer capacity by
 
05:14:55.490 --> 05:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
impact fees or by additional State
 
05:14:57.890 --> 05:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
regulation or assistance we need to look
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
into those things
 
05:15:03.288 --> 05:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
um and then separately we need to look
 
05:15:05.810 --> 05:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
into those areas that are not going to
 
05:15:09.970 --> 05:15:09.980 align:start position:0%
have Town Water and Sewer anytime soon
 
05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
but still need to have more sensible
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations than 20 acre lots and
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
I think uh what we were told before
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
um about uh where you have
 
05:15:27.470 --> 05:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
um uh both
 
05:15:29.690 --> 05:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
um an individual septic system and
 
05:15:33.410 --> 05:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
individual well that the maximum needed
 
05:15:37.010 --> 05:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
is probably one acre uh that was
 
05:15:38.868 --> 05:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
actually larger than I had thought but
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'll be interested to hear what the
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
engineers have to say uh when they come
 
05:15:46.010 --> 05:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
to talk to talk to us but I think
 
05:15:48.170 --> 05:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
um the earlier presenter knows more
 
05:15:50.150 --> 05:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
about that than I do so for the moment
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to him but
 
05:15:55.550 --> 05:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
still one acre is not five acres it's
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
not ten acres it's not 20 acres
 
05:16:01.730 --> 05:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
and so we need to look at things that
 
05:16:05.770 --> 05:16:05.780 align:start position:0%
make sense and that are reasonable and
 
05:16:07.850 --> 05:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
practicable because you're never going
 
05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to build any kind of
 
05:16:12.890 --> 05:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
affordable housing on 20 acre lots
 
05:16:15.530 --> 05:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
so I that's where I I think that's where
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
I want to start Beyond adus which are
 
05:16:18.360 --> 05:16:19.550 align:start position:0%
I want to start Beyond adus which are
obviously

05:16:19.550 --> 05:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
05:16:22.910 --> 05:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
um a necessary component but we already
 
05:16:24.650 --> 05:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
have a bill on that
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
um and I was going to ask representative
 
05:16:31.010 --> 05:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
Reed um and maybe when I when I finish
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying I'll ask her uh I was
 
05:16:36.050 --> 05:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to ask her um uh what she wants to
 
05:16:38.208 --> 05:16:38.218 align:start position:0%
do with it now that it's been tabled
 
05:16:40.250 --> 05:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
um but clearly we need to go beyond that
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
because adus are not going to solve the
 
05:16:44.030 --> 05:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
problem by themselves
 
05:16:46.610 --> 05:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
um and I do think where we have to start
 
05:16:50.448 --> 05:16:50.458 align:start position:0%
with is with zoning uh and then go on to
 
05:16:52.610 --> 05:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
building codes and financing
 
05:16:56.990 --> 05:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:02.030 --> 05:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
05:17:02.040 --> 05:17:03.170 align:start position:0%
um thank you
um

05:17:03.170 --> 05:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:06.890 --> 05:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think that the building code
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
right now we have a Statewide building
 
05:17:16.190 --> 05:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
code and then local municipalities can
 
05:17:19.010 --> 05:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
adopt more stringent stuff
 
05:17:22.930 --> 05:17:22.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
in a large sense that is what
 
05:17:29.448 --> 05:17:29.458 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs was talking about
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
as far as like being able to to to do
 
05:17:37.490 --> 05:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
allow for local like adjustments
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
um those adjustments are already always
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
going to be more restrictive they can't
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
be less restrictive than the Statewide
 
05:17:45.288 --> 05:17:45.298 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:17:49.070 --> 05:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see how
 
05:17:49.080 --> 05:17:49.910 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see how
um

05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:52.970 --> 05:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
other than restricting that option to
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
the municipalities entirely which
 
05:17:59.930 --> 05:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'll just from my experience I know that
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
one part of the municipal associations
 
05:18:06.970 --> 05:18:06.980 align:start position:0%
legislative priorities is to allow more
 
05:18:10.610 --> 05:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
flexibility with adopting more recent
 
05:18:13.270 --> 05:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
Zone building code stuff
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
I don't see that that is going to be I
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be a hard sell and
 
05:18:23.690 --> 05:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
so I have to agree that that zoning
 
05:18:23.700 --> 05:18:24.890 align:start position:0%
so I have to agree that that zoning
um

05:18:24.890 --> 05:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:28.610 --> 05:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
is probably the easiest thing to and and
 
05:18:30.288 --> 05:18:30.298 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably the most impactful
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
because I think that building codes the
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
building codes allow the three foot set
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
setback from the sides they allow all of
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
those types of things seem to be allowed
 
05:18:40.920 --> 05:18:42.590 align:start position:0%
those types of things seem to be allowed
they're

05:18:42.590 --> 05:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
um in the building code
 
05:18:46.850 --> 05:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
they're just not allowed in the zoning
 
05:18:51.410 --> 05:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
and so I think that the zoning we would
 
05:18:53.690 --> 05:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
have to do a lot of trimming of the fat
 
05:18:56.990 --> 05:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
of zoning before we're ever hampered by
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
the the limits of the building code and
 
05:19:05.090 --> 05:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I think that that is where my focus
 
05:19:10.190 --> 05:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
kind of seems to be uh kind of steering
 
05:19:11.810 --> 05:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
me towards
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think I think there's some
 
05:19:17.448 --> 05:19:17.458 align:start position:0%
Merit to that I think that housing
 
05:19:19.128 --> 05:19:19.138 align:start position:0%
action brought up when they presented
 
05:19:21.288 --> 05:19:21.298 align:start position:0%
about there's there seems to be gaps
 
05:19:23.448 --> 05:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
between the written codes and then like
 
05:19:25.310 --> 05:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
what's required of the town
 
05:19:28.970 --> 05:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
so maybe requiring the town
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
be transparent about what they're
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
requiring ahead of time and no last
 
05:19:35.090 --> 05:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
minute changes and because that's what
 
05:19:37.368 --> 05:19:37.378 align:start position:0%
we run into is maybe like something's
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
approved by a planning board or in and
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
goes through the correct process and
 
05:19:43.070 --> 05:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
then last minute something comes up and
 
05:19:45.170 --> 05:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
said oh you actually need to do this as
 
05:19:45.180 --> 05:19:46.430 align:start position:0%
said oh you actually need to do this as
well

05:19:46.430 --> 05:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:19:46.440 --> 05:19:47.090 align:start position:0%
well
um

05:19:47.090 --> 05:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
I could see the possibility of getting
 
05:19:50.750 --> 05:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
some some people on board to do
 
05:19:53.090 --> 05:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
legislation to deal with like
 
05:19:55.368 --> 05:19:55.378 align:start position:0%
no approving and then taking it back
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
subject to another thing
 
05:19:57.360 --> 05:19:58.550 align:start position:0%
subject to another thing
so

05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you Mr
 
05:20:03.110 --> 05:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
chairman yes uh I've said before that um
 
05:20:06.288 --> 05:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
you know a bill such that no political
 
05:20:08.090 --> 05:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
subdivision may require any further
 
05:20:10.910 --> 05:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
requirements be it zoning or licensing
 
05:20:10.920 --> 05:20:12.110 align:start position:0%
requirements be it zoning or licensing
requirements

05:20:12.110 --> 05:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
that are in place at the time of
 
05:20:16.670 --> 05:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
issuance of the building permit for the
 
05:20:18.410 --> 05:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
property being developed we've heard
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
multiple presenters early on saying that
 
05:20:23.270 --> 05:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
they've gone to town X they've got a
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
permit with conditions 1 through 37
 
05:20:28.610 --> 05:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
they've complied with all those they go
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
for their occupancy permits or
 
05:20:32.690 --> 05:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
inspections along the way well I know we
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
asked these 37 things well here's
 
05:20:36.530 --> 05:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
another 17 that we needed to comply yes
 
05:20:38.570 --> 05:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
it's not in statute but really we'd
 
05:20:39.890 --> 05:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
really like that down if you want that
 
05:20:42.890 --> 05:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
CEOs or a man so uh to that extent
 
05:20:45.230 --> 05:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get cooperation from
 
05:20:48.410 --> 05:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
the towns that have the 20-acre zoning a
 
05:20:48.420 --> 05:20:49.250 align:start position:0%
the towns that have the 20-acre zoning a
minimum

05:20:49.250 --> 05:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
05:20:52.250 --> 05:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
20 acre requirements for building lot to
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
work with the cities that know they have
 
05:20:56.090 --> 05:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
the problems that are doing wonderful
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
things thus far to minimize this problem
 
05:21:01.610 --> 05:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
so you've got your you know they're not
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
in my backyard we don't want we don't
 
05:21:05.030 --> 05:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
want these um
 
05:21:07.310 --> 05:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
affordable housing units and we know who
 
05:21:09.770 --> 05:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
the towns are let's face it um
 
05:21:11.628 --> 05:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
so I think you're going to need to have
 
05:21:13.670 --> 05:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
some type of Statewide preemption to say
 
05:21:15.470 --> 05:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
hey these are the rules in place when
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
the game started no new rules until that
 
05:21:20.030 --> 05:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
game is over uh the build you know next
 
05:21:22.250 --> 05:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
project we'll talk about it so something
 
05:21:24.110 --> 05:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
to that extent
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
um it follows with what representative
 
05:21:26.990 --> 05:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
gibbs's suggestion suggested
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh yes it does
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
um and in reference to what uh
 
05:21:34.850 --> 05:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative yokolo was was saying um
 
05:21:36.650 --> 05:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
I agree we have to start zoning that was
 
05:21:38.750 --> 05:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
what I said in the first place uh we do
 
05:21:40.310 --> 05:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh because you're never going to get
 
05:21:42.708 --> 05:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
anywhere if if zoning prevents you from
 
05:21:45.770 --> 05:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
doing something but then
 
05:21:45.780 --> 05:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
doing something but then
um

05:21:46.550 --> 05:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:48.770 --> 05:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
the building code issue comes up just
 
05:21:51.170 --> 05:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
exactly as representative Wallace has
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
described from what we've heard
 
05:21:55.550 --> 05:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
repeatedly and from what I've heard
 
05:21:59.050 --> 05:21:59.060 align:start position:0%
individually as well uh that
 
05:22:02.510 --> 05:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
you have something on the books and then
 
05:22:02.520 --> 05:22:03.830 align:start position:0%
you have something on the books and then
somebody

05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
um and again I don't want to get any
 
05:22:07.310 --> 05:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
videos here but it seems frequently to
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
be the fire commissioner uh comes back
 
05:22:10.970 --> 05:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
and says well
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
we really needed to do X Y and Z in
 
05:22:16.490 --> 05:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
addition to what we already told you and
 
05:22:18.050 --> 05:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
in addition to what's actually on the
 
05:22:19.970 --> 05:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
books before we can actually give you an
 
05:22:22.970 --> 05:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
occupancy permit and that obviously uh
 
05:22:26.208 --> 05:22:26.218 align:start position:0%
does two things one is it tremendously
 
05:22:30.288 --> 05:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
increases the amount of time and uh both
 
05:22:32.208 --> 05:22:32.218 align:start position:0%
in and of itself and in terms of the
 
05:22:34.368 --> 05:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
amount of time it takes it increases the
 
05:22:34.378 --> 05:22:35.690 align:start position:0%
amount of time it takes it increases the
expense

05:22:35.690 --> 05:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
expense
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and if people are aware that this is
 
05:22:38.520 --> 05:22:39.948 align:start position:0%
um and if people are aware that this is
happening

05:22:39.948 --> 05:22:39.958 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
um there are some places that I would
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
imagine developers simply won't go
 
05:22:46.010 --> 05:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
because they know it's going to be
 
05:22:46.020 --> 05:22:47.448 align:start position:0%
because they know it's going to be
impossible

05:22:47.448 --> 05:22:47.458 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
um or they'll get to a certain point
 
05:22:50.990 --> 05:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
they'll just throw up their hands in in
 
05:22:54.170 --> 05:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
despair uh and that's that's not what we
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
want that's not going to solve the
 
05:22:58.430 --> 05:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
problem that we have in New Hampshire uh
 
05:23:00.530 --> 05:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
with regard to housing in general or
 
05:23:03.470 --> 05:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to affordable housing so at
 
05:23:05.208 --> 05:23:05.218 align:start position:0%
some point we're going to have to say
 
05:23:08.030 --> 05:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay we have some flexibility for local
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
needs but you can be more stringent in
 
05:23:15.170 --> 05:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
the state code only up to this point
 
05:23:17.330 --> 05:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps
 
05:23:19.730 --> 05:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
um you know if if you tell uh the
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
developer that they have to do these 30
 
05:23:25.490 --> 05:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
37 things you cannot then come back uh
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
at the occupancy permit uh stage or
 
05:23:31.788 --> 05:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
whatever the later stages are and say
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay now we're going to add you know
 
05:23:38.810 --> 05:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
three or four six more more items and
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
have it become impossible
 
05:23:43.250 --> 05:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
um so yes I want to start with zoning
 
05:23:45.170 --> 05:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
but I think we also have to be aware
 
05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
that these other issues are going to
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
come next
 
05:23:53.390 --> 05:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
is that fair that's fair representative
 
05:23:53.400 --> 05:23:56.810 align:start position:0%
is that fair that's fair representative
Reed

05:23:56.810 --> 05:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.208 --> 05:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
so yeah on that so the what
 
05:24:00.708 --> 05:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace was describing is
 
05:24:01.970 --> 05:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
kind of like the headaches that
 
05:24:03.970 --> 05:24:03.980 align:start position:0%
developers face
 
05:24:06.890 --> 05:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
but then there's also like the initial
 
05:24:08.510 --> 05:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
zoning of like lot minimums I think
 
05:24:10.250 --> 05:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
we've identified lot minimums as a
 
05:24:10.260 --> 05:24:12.110 align:start position:0%
we've identified lot minimums as a
primary

05:24:12.110 --> 05:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
primary
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
um problem in in the zoning World in
 
05:24:19.310 --> 05:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
terms of of solving the housing crisis
 
05:24:21.830 --> 05:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
so what I would like to see again going
 
05:24:23.448 --> 05:24:23.458 align:start position:0%
back to that presentation a couple weeks
 
05:24:25.250 --> 05:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
ago where you know we talked about how
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
they even got started
 
05:24:30.110 --> 05:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
um is clarification in law that
 
05:24:33.128 --> 05:24:33.138 align:start position:0%
Municipal ordinances have to be based
 
05:24:36.110 --> 05:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
evidence-based evidence-backed for the
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
health safety and Welfare of the people
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
and like we can even get into more
 
05:24:41.930 --> 05:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
detail about what that means so that
 
05:24:44.930 --> 05:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
we're getting away from those arbitrary
 
05:24:46.550 --> 05:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
um this is kind of like what we want our
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
community to look like and we don't want
 
05:24:50.690 --> 05:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
those people in this community kind of
 
05:24:50.700 --> 05:24:52.490 align:start position:0%
those people in this community kind of
ordinances

05:24:52.490 --> 05:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
um so I think we can kind of have a
 
05:24:56.030 --> 05:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
broad statement saying it has the
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
ordinance is half to adhere to this
 
05:24:59.628 --> 05:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
broad principle of health safety and
 
05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
Welfare as we're defining it and then
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
also get into and therefore this is how
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
lot minimum shall be determined
 
05:25:09.230 --> 05:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
um and there's some other stuff too like
 
05:25:11.930 --> 05:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
square foot minimums um we've we've
 
05:25:13.788 --> 05:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
listed quite a few but I think those two
 
05:25:16.610 --> 05:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
in particular are important there's also
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
the other end of it which is the you
 
05:25:20.390 --> 05:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
know the the buyer and the financing and
 
05:25:23.890 --> 05:25:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.170 --> 05:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
that and this does touch on adus and I
 
05:25:28.730 --> 05:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
don't think adus are a Magic Bullet but
 
05:25:30.410 --> 05:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
I do think it's a low hanging fruit but
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
it also touches on General financing
 
05:25:34.128 --> 05:25:34.138 align:start position:0%
otherwise whereas people are running
 
05:25:36.170 --> 05:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
into financing problems
 
05:25:38.570 --> 05:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
when because the banks do not consider
 
05:25:40.850 --> 05:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
the income that they can receive from
 
05:25:43.610 --> 05:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
that property and so obviously Adu
 
05:25:45.890 --> 05:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
income rental income from Adu is
 
05:25:48.650 --> 05:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
something that a bank should be I think
 
05:25:51.470 --> 05:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
um taking into account when they're you
 
05:25:52.430 --> 05:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
know questioning whether or not to
 
05:25:54.170 --> 05:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
approve somebody for that and that's
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
been a major barrier for people to buy
 
05:25:59.150 --> 05:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
properties that they would be able to
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
afford because that property has income
 
05:26:03.590 --> 05:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that I think that's something else
 
05:26:08.090 --> 05:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:09.650 --> 05:26:09.660 align:start position:0%
McConkey did you have something please
 
05:26:13.010 --> 05:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:16.128 --> 05:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
so I I would totally agree that if there
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
was language that could address that
 
05:26:22.368 --> 05:26:22.378 align:start position:0%
when a when a homeowner or developer
 
05:26:24.830 --> 05:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
starts a process and pulls his permits
 
05:26:24.840 --> 05:26:26.208 align:start position:0%
starts a process and pulls his permits
that

05:26:26.208 --> 05:26:26.218 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:28.970 --> 05:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
there's you know there's an end point to
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
that as long as considered and there
 
05:26:33.410 --> 05:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
wasn't a fault Tom had a bill with the
 
05:26:36.890 --> 05:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
issue on someone had already built uh
 
05:26:39.170 --> 05:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
to the town standard and all of a sudden
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
the driveway has to be six feet wider I
 
05:26:43.128 --> 05:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
mean that's you know if we can get
 
05:26:46.550 --> 05:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
language it does that zoning zoning is I
 
05:26:48.050 --> 05:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're looking to come out
 
05:26:50.030 --> 05:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
of here with zoning suggestions because
 
05:26:52.490 --> 05:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
I don't see that happening real quickly
 
05:26:55.128 --> 05:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
but I think I think we could develop
 
05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
some models for consideration and we
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
could make people aware of that could be
 
05:27:03.530 --> 05:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
a finding out of here instead of a
 
05:27:06.530 --> 05:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
instead of an order page this is what we
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
came to I mean there is truly some
 
05:27:11.708 --> 05:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
Innovative things being done in Dover
 
05:27:14.510 --> 05:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
some of the micro stuff in Manchester
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
New Market I think if we were to
 
05:27:19.010 --> 05:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
highlight those things and make a goal
 
05:27:21.250 --> 05:27:21.260 align:start position:0%
of an ongoing committee on another time
 
05:27:25.010 --> 05:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a laudable goal
 
05:27:27.770 --> 05:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
and if we can if we can find some other
 
05:27:31.250 --> 05:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
items as recommendations but we know we
 
05:27:34.550 --> 05:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
know that as the gentleman had talked
 
05:27:36.250 --> 05:27:36.260 align:start position:0%
about lot size
 
05:27:39.650 --> 05:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
being not determined by today's standard
 
05:27:41.868 --> 05:27:41.878 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that's certainly and I I
 
05:27:43.550 --> 05:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
think you were talking about continuing
 
05:27:45.288 --> 05:27:45.298 align:start position:0%
the conversation so I think we should
 
05:27:49.868 --> 05:27:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.390 --> 05:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
that was going to be the next but
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
not not the top I want some people in
 
05:27:59.090 --> 05:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
here that work in the field and I could
 
05:28:01.850 --> 05:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
help those suggestions on that and have
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
we had someone
 
05:28:04.200 --> 05:28:04.850 align:start position:0%
we had someone
um

05:28:04.850 --> 05:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:07.128 --> 05:28:07.138 align:start position:0%
I guess we we've skirted and we've
 
05:28:09.770 --> 05:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
talked about manufactured housing
 
05:28:11.570 --> 05:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if we there was any need
 
05:28:13.910 --> 05:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
to have any more on that that's that's
 
05:28:16.010 --> 05:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
also my plan is to invite some even for
 
05:28:17.330 --> 05:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
that we're on it you're on it Mr
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
chairman all right I I think right
 
05:28:21.590 --> 05:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
before I recognize you I think that
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea to put together maybe
 
05:28:24.120 --> 05:28:24.970 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea to put together maybe
um

05:28:24.970 --> 05:28:24.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in legislation but get
 
05:28:28.550 --> 05:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
the researcher to put together like
 
05:28:31.310 --> 05:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
model policies from places like towns
 
05:28:33.410 --> 05:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
that have done you know thinking Dover
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
like what if their policies look like
 
05:28:36.170 --> 05:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
that have enabled them to put together
 
05:28:38.448 --> 05:28:38.458 align:start position:0%
the cottages on Back River Road for
 
05:28:38.458 --> 05:28:39.470 align:start position:0%
the cottages on Back River Road for
instance

05:28:39.470 --> 05:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
instance
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
um and put that together in almost a
 
05:28:43.368 --> 05:28:43.378 align:start position:0%
booklet or something that we can
 
05:28:45.530 --> 05:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
distribute or have the municipal
 
05:28:47.390 --> 05:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
Association during their training
 
05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
um distribute all these policies to
 
05:28:50.150 --> 05:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
local planning and zoning boards so they
 
05:28:51.650 --> 05:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
kind of know creative ideas if they're
 
05:28:54.170 --> 05:28:54.180 align:start position:0%
interested in pursuing those and I might
 
05:28:56.750 --> 05:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
suggest that and what we're going to try
 
05:28:59.448 --> 05:28:59.458 align:start position:0%
and do in Osprey in Carroll County is
 
05:29:02.330 --> 05:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
our proposal is probably going to start
 
05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
out with an overlay District in a town
 
05:29:07.970 --> 05:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
and if it works there then like everyone
 
05:29:10.550 --> 05:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
said in the future you can expand you
 
05:29:14.090 --> 05:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
can expand it's a it's a softer way to
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
get to town to possibly do what you need
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you apologize for my uh my attire
 
05:29:28.250 --> 05:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh but I was at work listening to the
 
05:29:30.410 --> 05:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
proceedings this morning on YouTube the
 
05:29:32.330 --> 05:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
whole time it was great
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
um I take it because I was out of the
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
room for a minute but we were just
 
05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the way to move forward at
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
this point all right I'll start by
 
05:29:40.730 --> 05:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
saying the first day we were here uh I'm
 
05:29:42.770 --> 05:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
not one that's going to support state
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
mandated zoning around to our towns I
 
05:29:48.350 --> 05:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
can't do it I do like representative
 
05:29:50.690 --> 05:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
mcconkey's suggestion about some zoning
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
models I think that's a great idea I
 
05:29:55.610 --> 05:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
also have a funny feeling that the towns
 
05:29:56.930 --> 05:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
aren't stupid either and you we've
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
already heard of a lot of them that are
 
05:29:59.930 --> 05:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
actually starting to make the moves
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
towards improving on their own and I
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
think that's the way it should happen I
 
05:30:05.690 --> 05:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
know zoning bugs some people I know it
 
05:30:08.750 --> 05:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
bugs maritas I know it bugs Jason sworns
 
05:30:11.090 --> 05:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
I know it bugs a lot of people but I
 
05:30:12.530 --> 05:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anybody sit at that table
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
and tell me that that's the drop dead
 
05:30:16.010 --> 05:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
problem that we're having with the
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
person after person after person and I
 
05:30:22.368 --> 05:30:22.378 align:start position:0%
recommend getting on Senate Bill 78 so
 
05:30:23.570 --> 05:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
we can get those people here because
 
05:30:25.010 --> 05:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
they both claim to build houses
 
05:30:28.128 --> 05:30:28.138 align:start position:0%
affordable housing I say it's cost
 
05:30:29.930 --> 05:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of this cost we may not have
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
anything to do with but there may be
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
some things that we can looking at the
 
05:30:35.810 --> 05:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
zoning I mean uh the codes fire codes
 
05:30:37.550 --> 05:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
05:30:37.560 --> 05:30:38.330 align:start position:0%
etc etc
um

05:30:38.330 --> 05:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:40.910 --> 05:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
but again I'm not to mandate zoning on
 
05:30:42.530 --> 05:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
the town side I would never be able to
 
05:30:44.990 --> 05:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
support I do have a question though 20
 
05:30:48.288 --> 05:30:48.298 align:start position:0%
acre who's got 28 or minimums
 
05:30:52.550 --> 05:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
we I I the zoning Atlas we put a 20 acre
 
05:30:55.368 --> 05:30:55.378 align:start position:0%
minimum in it and I think it popped up a
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
little in the north plate because here's
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
the thing even if some towns have 5 10
 
05:31:00.550 --> 05:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
20 acre
 
05:31:03.288 --> 05:31:03.298 align:start position:0%
minimums I have a funny feeling they're
 
05:31:05.150 --> 05:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
not going to have much of a demand for
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
affordable housing complexes anyway
 
05:31:09.288 --> 05:31:09.298 align:start position:0%
they're the rural communities that want
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
to stay Rural and you know what any any
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
type of zoning change is going to be a
 
05:31:15.770 --> 05:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
hard sell because
 
05:31:18.530 --> 05:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay I mean we have to admit some of
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
these ordinants are probably put in
 
05:31:23.390 --> 05:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
place to limit density by Design
 
05:31:25.610 --> 05:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
and you know what I don't blame them I
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
mean I'm from Hooksett we have
 
05:31:28.970 --> 05:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
voluntarily expanded our density when I
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
moved there in 78 we were 3 400 people
 
05:31:33.470 --> 05:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
now we're pushing sixteen thousand we've
 
05:31:35.628 --> 05:31:35.638 align:start position:0%
done it ourselves but now I represent
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton and I don't see them wanting
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
16 000 people in Denver nor am I going
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
to go there and say hey we know better
 
05:31:45.170 --> 05:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
than you you should so I I I I don't
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
even think that's the direction we
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
should be looking at
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
um again I don't think the demand is
 
05:31:52.910 --> 05:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
there for them and and I
 
05:31:54.590 --> 05:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm one of the few natives I guess
 
05:31:56.570 --> 05:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
left in this legislature New Hampshire
 
05:31:57.770 --> 05:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
right but
 
05:32:00.530 --> 05:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
I for those that think zoning is the way
 
05:32:02.628 --> 05:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
to go to increase that density across
 
05:32:04.128 --> 05:32:04.138 align:start position:0%
the board
 
05:32:07.970 --> 05:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
um mandated uh from rural communities to
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
to suburbs take a ride down Route 128
 
05:32:13.970 --> 05:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts please and get off the
 
05:32:17.570 --> 05:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
highway in in Waltham Western in that
 
05:32:20.090 --> 05:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
whole area 25 years ago that was as
 
05:32:22.368 --> 05:32:22.378 align:start position:0%
rural as New Hampshire is take a ride
 
05:32:24.430 --> 05:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
down there now it is gridlock
 
05:32:26.930 --> 05:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
pandemonium it's awful and if that's the
 
05:32:28.850 --> 05:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
goal you have for New Hampshire then I
 
05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
suggest we start going after our Town's
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
local zoning it's not my goal
 
05:32:35.330 --> 05:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it at that I think we've
 
05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
got some constructive things to look at
 
05:32:38.930 --> 05:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
but for me zoning isn't one of them
 
05:32:40.970 --> 05:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so yeah and so thank you so
 
05:32:42.110 --> 05:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
what what I understand that
 
05:32:43.970 --> 05:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace's language and
 
05:32:46.128 --> 05:32:46.138 align:start position:0%
final approval something that like that
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
you'd be on board with
 
05:32:50.330 --> 05:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
um and then you know a model model
 
05:32:52.730 --> 05:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
policies free municipalities no mandates
 
05:32:55.610 --> 05:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
but like a packet of model policies for
 
05:32:57.890 --> 05:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
them okay and I really think we should
 
05:32:59.390 --> 05:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
get those people I don't know if we'll
 
05:33:01.368 --> 05:33:01.378 align:start position:0%
have time maybe we can check the docket
 
05:33:04.970 --> 05:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
from 78 it was a municipal County and
 
05:33:06.410 --> 05:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
get those two affordable housing
 
05:33:08.990 --> 05:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
developers in here uh the whole premise
 
05:33:11.330 --> 05:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
of the affordable of House Bill 78 which
 
05:33:13.490 --> 05:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
we might be able to embrace we can talk
 
05:33:15.948 --> 05:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
to the chair uh it also talks about more
 
05:33:18.650 --> 05:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
costs which are Surety bonds right now
 
05:33:20.570 --> 05:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
you have Surety bonds for our for
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
landscaping for roadways Etc et cetera
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
but yet all these things are constructed
 
05:33:28.128 --> 05:33:28.138 align:start position:0%
with the supervision and Engineering
 
05:33:30.650 --> 05:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
paid for by the developer insisted upon
 
05:33:33.470 --> 05:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
by the town so what do they need to bond
 
05:33:35.448 --> 05:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
locked up in the bank for for six ten
 
05:33:37.490 --> 05:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
years you know none of this stuff makes
 
05:33:40.310 --> 05:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
any sense so and I heard the
 
05:33:41.990 --> 05:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
conversation earlier about lengthening
 
05:33:44.208 --> 05:33:44.218 align:start position:0%
the time we we let them hold on to bond
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
money um or even impact fees that's
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
going in the opposite direction I
 
05:33:50.930 --> 05:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
thought that cost is going to get passed
 
05:33:53.690 --> 05:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
on down to the consumer again one last
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
thing on impact fees that I did here in
 
05:33:57.830 --> 05:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
the conversation this morning something
 
05:33:59.570 --> 05:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
else I think we can look at I believe
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's only 14 towns in New Hampshire
 
05:34:03.110 --> 05:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
that impose impact fees
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
got a 234 that's not many books it
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
happens to be one of them
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
but the they're pretty specific and a
 
05:34:12.050 --> 05:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
lot of times
 
05:34:14.090 --> 05:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
the money should get returned to the
 
05:34:16.250 --> 05:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
developers but they always seem to find
 
05:34:18.650 --> 05:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
a way that's not really related that
 
05:34:20.448 --> 05:34:20.458 align:start position:0%
they find a way to spend the money on
 
05:34:22.610 --> 05:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
so impact fees could be looked at as a
 
05:34:25.128 --> 05:34:25.138 align:start position:0%
way to save some money
 
05:34:27.530 --> 05:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you Mr
 
05:34:29.750 --> 05:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to follow up with
 
05:34:29.760 --> 05:34:31.128 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to follow up with
uh

05:34:31.128 --> 05:34:31.138 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh you know I've done
 
05:34:35.628 --> 05:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
some work in a lot of different
 
05:34:38.030 --> 05:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
communities we've heard some from some
 
05:34:40.090 --> 05:34:40.100 align:start position:0%
good people who are aggressive
 
05:34:43.010 --> 05:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
especially people towards the Seacoast
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
they're your planning boards are very
 
05:34:47.410 --> 05:34:47.420 align:start position:0%
aggressive I go to a marketing session
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
Dover would show up and say come on in
 
05:34:52.730 --> 05:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
you know then you have the towns that
 
05:34:54.170 --> 05:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
don't want you there
 
05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
I've dealt with them
 
05:34:58.490 --> 05:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
I had a project that took me over 14
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
months to get approved halfway through
 
05:35:03.470 --> 05:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
the process they went from three acres
 
05:35:05.330 --> 05:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
zoning to five acres only because they
 
05:35:07.788 --> 05:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
didn't want it was the first cluster
 
05:35:10.490 --> 05:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
Zone development in the town it was it
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
was on for it they just didn't want it
 
05:35:14.750 --> 05:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
and they did everything they could to
 
05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
stop us from getting it you have those
 
05:35:18.830 --> 05:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
towns and I can name a half a dozen
 
05:35:21.050 --> 05:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
towns where I have personal experience
 
05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
where they don't want any growth
 
05:35:26.930 --> 05:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
and to you know like to follow up with
 
05:35:31.670 --> 05:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative wall should to impose
 
05:35:34.730 --> 05:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
restrictions on on some of these towns
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
will there meet with a lot of resistance
 
05:35:38.810 --> 05:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate we need it
 
05:35:44.930 --> 05:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
people are going out on the street
 
05:35:47.330 --> 05:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
no housing
 
05:35:49.490 --> 05:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a crisis and we're in a
 
05:35:51.350 --> 05:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
between a rock and a high place but
 
05:35:53.448 --> 05:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
we've got to be careful on what we want
 
05:35:55.368 --> 05:35:55.378 align:start position:0%
to put forward because half of it won't
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
go anywhere I don't think and I've also
 
05:35:59.040 --> 05:36:00.890 align:start position:0%
go anywhere I don't think and I've also
had

05:36:00.890 --> 05:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:36:03.410 --> 05:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
people in the middle would go through
 
05:36:04.970 --> 05:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
the punch list and all of a sudden
 
05:36:06.650 --> 05:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
there's more popping up in fire
 
05:36:08.750 --> 05:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
departments are number one on my list
 
05:36:12.288 --> 05:36:12.298 align:start position:0%
fire departments and wetlands people
 
05:36:15.050 --> 05:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
conservation okay representative Ocala
 
05:36:17.810 --> 05:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.628 --> 05:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
um I think you know from from everything
 
05:36:23.570 --> 05:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
that I've said that I'm adamantly
 
05:36:27.050 --> 05:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
um in favor of limiting the
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
um overreach of zoning I think that
 
05:36:33.948 --> 05:36:33.958 align:start position:0%
it is inappropriate for
 
05:36:36.650 --> 05:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
for under the guise of health and safety
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:36:41.030 --> 05:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
um Central planning your
 
05:36:43.970 --> 05:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
um your municipality into only the
 
05:36:46.490 --> 05:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
people that currently live there
 
05:36:48.050 --> 05:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:36:50.448 --> 05:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
I also
 
05:36:54.050 --> 05:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
um I think that that zoning is
 
05:36:58.430 --> 05:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
um an ability that the state gave to
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
those local municipalities and it can
 
05:37:05.628 --> 05:37:05.638 align:start position:0%
place strings on that ability that it
 
05:37:08.930 --> 05:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
that it gave to those municipalities and
 
05:37:11.750 --> 05:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
it is not any overreach it is just
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
recognizing that sometimes we gave them
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
too much latitude and they abuse that
 
05:37:20.690 --> 05:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
Latitude I think that
 
05:37:20.700 --> 05:37:21.530 align:start position:0%
Latitude I think that
um

05:37:21.530 --> 05:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I I like the idea
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
of kind of having
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
like model zoning or something like that
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
that is something that is
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
um good something to strive for and and
 
05:37:37.920 --> 05:37:39.770 align:start position:0%
um good something to strive for and and
um

05:37:39.770 --> 05:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:43.610 --> 05:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
maybe and and I think I've expressed to
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
the the chair before about my concern
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
about the housing Champion
 
05:37:48.958 --> 05:37:50.090 align:start position:0%
about the housing Champion
um

05:37:50.090 --> 05:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:52.250 --> 05:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
legislation going through the Senate and
 
05:37:56.570 --> 05:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
that I I want to see some like they're
 
05:37:58.850 --> 05:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
talking about money being offered to
 
05:37:58.860 --> 05:38:00.770 align:start position:0%
talking about money being offered to
municipalities

05:38:00.770 --> 05:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:38:02.510 --> 05:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
um if they're you know a housing
 
05:38:05.810 --> 05:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
Champion or what and and that there
 
05:38:09.050 --> 05:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
needs to be stringent kind of goal posts
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
that they need to actually like move the
 
05:38:13.550 --> 05:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
ball forward and not just stay in the
 
05:38:16.250 --> 05:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
status quo if they are needing to or if
 
05:38:18.350 --> 05:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to have the ability to get
 
05:38:21.470 --> 05:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
any uh assistance from the from the
 
05:38:24.170 --> 05:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
state and so I have a lot of concerns
 
05:38:27.708 --> 05:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
that that maybe they would already
 
05:38:30.288 --> 05:38:30.298 align:start position:0%
um you know qualify at the level that
 
05:38:33.530 --> 05:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
they are that they are currently you
 
05:38:35.090 --> 05:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
know restricting people
 
05:38:38.930 --> 05:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
so I think that you know there's I'm I'm
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
happy with you know absolutely coming in
 
05:38:46.010 --> 05:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
and saying you as a state statement
 
05:38:49.010 --> 05:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide zoning requirement you are not
 
05:38:51.530 --> 05:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
allowed to have a minimum house size
 
05:38:51.540 --> 05:38:53.090 align:start position:0%
allowed to have a minimum house size
requirement

05:38:53.090 --> 05:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:38:55.850 --> 05:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
I understand that right now under the
 
05:38:58.610 --> 05:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
building code you can only reach 200
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
square feet but if that changes I don't
 
05:39:02.930 --> 05:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
think we need to have additional
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that we can just say
 
05:39:05.638 --> 05:39:07.430 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that we can just say
no

05:39:07.430 --> 05:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:39:09.530 --> 05:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
um square foot requirements in your
 
05:39:11.930 --> 05:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
zoning it's not a it's a Statewide
 
05:39:14.208 --> 05:39:14.218 align:start position:0%
mandate and it's a reasonable one we
 
05:39:16.610 --> 05:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
already have we already have
 
05:39:18.948 --> 05:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
um you know property or we already have
 
05:39:22.010 --> 05:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
building code that can address those
 
05:39:22.020 --> 05:39:23.930 align:start position:0%
building code that can address those
size

05:39:23.930 --> 05:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
size
 
05:39:23.940 --> 05:39:24.788 align:start position:0%
size
um

05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:24.798 --> 05:39:26.570 align:start position:0%
um
opportunities

05:39:26.570 --> 05:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
or size requirements and that I don't
 
05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
think that is unreasonable I think that
 
05:39:36.050 --> 05:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
you can have wide support about stuff
 
05:39:37.610 --> 05:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:39:40.550 --> 05:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
um maybe not from not Universal support
 
05:39:44.208 --> 05:39:44.218 align:start position:0%
from you know staunch like people that
 
05:39:46.610 --> 05:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
think that that that municipality should
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
be able to do whatever they want but I
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
think most reasonable people are going
 
05:39:52.910 --> 05:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to vote in support of stuff
 
05:39:54.770 --> 05:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
stuff like that
 
05:39:57.470 --> 05:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I I do like the idea of having some
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
goals like if you do this if you you
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
know put legislation that allows this
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
type of thing and um then we're going to
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
recognize you as a housing Champion or
 
05:40:10.730 --> 05:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
something like that where we're going to
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
offer different opportunities or
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
incentives for that and I definitely
 
05:40:18.490 --> 05:40:18.500 align:start position:0%
agree that if we're when we're con
 
05:40:18.500 --> 05:40:20.410 align:start position:0%
agree that if we're when we're con
considering

05:40:20.410 --> 05:40:20.420 align:start position:0%
considering
 
05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities either through the funding
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
um either I don't know low interest
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
loans or whatever so that they can have
 
05:40:31.070 --> 05:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
sewer and water expand sewer and water
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
that we have time we have strings
 
05:40:35.090 --> 05:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
attached to that to say that you have to
 
05:40:36.770 --> 05:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
have increased density when you're
 
05:40:39.530 --> 05:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
putting in water and sewer it's it's
 
05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
unreasonable investment of your money to
 
05:40:43.200 --> 05:40:44.510 align:start position:0%
unreasonable investment of your money to
put

05:40:44.510 --> 05:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
put
 
05:40:46.550 --> 05:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
um all of this infrastructure in and
 
05:40:48.110 --> 05:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
then have like five people be able to
 
05:40:50.510 --> 05:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
use it when 40 people could it's just
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
bad investment for the state and so I
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
think that we should have all of those
 
05:40:58.330 --> 05:40:58.340 align:start position:0%
um strings attached and and and
 
05:41:02.208 --> 05:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
responding as I said to to your comment
 
05:41:04.490 --> 05:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
um earlier today
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
about how the um
 
05:41:10.190 --> 05:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
the bills or or amendments that we
 
05:41:12.530 --> 05:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
propose go to their
 
05:41:14.770 --> 05:41:14.780 align:start position:0%
um you know traditional
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
committees I think that this committee
 
05:41:19.610 --> 05:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
has spent an enormous amount of time
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
getting to become experts on this issue
 
05:41:26.510 --> 05:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
and that I don't think that it is is
 
05:41:28.850 --> 05:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
possible to convey that amount of
 
05:41:31.550 --> 05:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
expertise in a com in a traditional
 
05:41:34.010 --> 05:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing and so I definitely
 
05:41:36.470 --> 05:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of the chair or the
 
05:41:36.480 --> 05:41:37.448 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of the chair or the
speaker

05:41:37.448 --> 05:41:37.458 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
designating some things that we are now
 
05:41:43.250 --> 05:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
kind of the resident experts in the in
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
the house to be
 
05:41:46.320 --> 05:41:46.850 align:start position:0%
the house to be
um

05:41:46.850 --> 05:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:49.610 --> 05:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh addressing that topic you know more
 
05:41:51.050 --> 05:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
thoroughly if he wants to add a second
 
05:41:53.628 --> 05:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
committee to it that's that's obviously
 
05:41:55.788 --> 05:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
within the speaker's prerogative but I
 
05:41:57.770 --> 05:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
definitely think that it would be a
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
disservice to not utilize the expertise
 
05:42:01.910 --> 05:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
that was gained in this committee you
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.730 --> 05:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:09.708 --> 05:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
um I do think a lot of what we've been
 
05:42:12.410 --> 05:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
talking about is going to be a hard sell
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm not minimizing the difficulties
 
05:42:17.690 --> 05:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things
 
05:42:23.690 --> 05:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
um one thing is that um personally
 
05:42:25.970 --> 05:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
um I could support some things that
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make me personally feel really
 
05:42:31.930 --> 05:42:31.940 align:start position:0%
happy in order to know that never again
 
05:42:34.730 --> 05:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh will there be a family with children
 
05:42:37.550 --> 05:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
living in a car in New Hampshire in the
 
05:42:39.650 --> 05:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
winter which has happened
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
um so that is something that I feel very
 
05:42:45.288 --> 05:42:45.298 align:start position:0%
strongly about and there are things that
 
05:42:47.628 --> 05:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
I would give up to be sure of that
 
05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
um but then going beyond that
 
05:42:53.030 --> 05:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we need to respect the
 
05:42:55.070 --> 05:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
um uh feelings and opinions of people
 
05:42:57.890 --> 05:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
who have lived in a rural community uh
 
05:42:59.930 --> 05:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
for a long time I'm not minimizing that
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
either I grew up on a farm uh in New
 
05:43:06.230 --> 05:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
Jersey uh and the area was extremely
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
rural when I was a child and it began to
 
05:43:12.470 --> 05:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
change during my childhood and now where
 
05:43:16.550 --> 05:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
my family's 150 year old farmhouse stood
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
there is no now a pink stucco minimal is
 
05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
the ugliest thing I have ever seen in my
 
05:43:24.170 --> 05:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
entire life
 
05:43:25.850 --> 05:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:43:29.150 --> 05:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
isn't what I want anywhere
 
05:43:32.090 --> 05:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
um but I don't run the world uh and none
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
of us do and we have to keep our eye on
 
05:43:39.890 --> 05:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
the ball in terms of what our goals are
 
05:43:43.570 --> 05:43:43.580 align:start position:0%
um and I think our major goal has to be
 
05:43:48.110 --> 05:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
more affordable housing
 
05:43:48.120 --> 05:43:48.770 align:start position:0%
more affordable housing
um

05:43:48.770 --> 05:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
so we have to find creative ways to
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
balance the needs of existing
 
05:43:57.650 --> 05:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
communities and I'm not saying that we
 
05:44:00.288 --> 05:44:00.298 align:start position:0%
should discount the needs of existing
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
communities and the needs of
 
05:44:08.510 --> 05:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
young people with families uh the needs
 
05:44:11.208 --> 05:44:11.218 align:start position:0%
of older people who can no longer afford
 
05:44:13.490 --> 05:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
where they've been living which we heard
 
05:44:16.250 --> 05:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
about uh just this morning
 
05:44:17.628 --> 05:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
um and that was quite heartbreaking
 
05:44:20.570 --> 05:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
somebody whose rent was 900 a month and
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
now it's going to be eighteen hundred
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
dollars a month and they have to move
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
but they have nowhere to move to
 
05:44:28.250 --> 05:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and that's where I think that as I
 
05:44:29.930 --> 05:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
suggested to the
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
um uh planning board director uh that
 
05:44:36.610 --> 05:44:36.620 align:start position:0%
the city needs to look into working with
 
05:44:38.810 --> 05:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
non-profits in applying for federal
 
05:44:40.910 --> 05:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
grants because that opportunity
 
05:44:43.368 --> 05:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
certainly has existed in the past and I
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
believe still exists again I'm more of
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
an expert on on what was in existence
 
05:44:51.048 --> 05:44:51.058 align:start position:0%
before I retired than what I am now uh
 
05:44:52.788 --> 05:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
but there are creative ways to to
 
05:44:55.310 --> 05:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
approach these things some of them are
 
05:44:57.650 --> 05:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
going to require I think more mandates
 
05:45:00.410 --> 05:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
than some of us would really like
 
05:45:02.930 --> 05:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
um but some of that is going is going to
 
05:45:04.190 --> 05:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
be necessary it's going to be
 
05:45:04.200 --> 05:45:05.810 align:start position:0%
be necessary it's going to be
unavoidable

05:45:05.810 --> 05:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
unavoidable
 
05:45:07.730 --> 05:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't think we can we can
 
05:45:10.548 --> 05:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
entirely stop it but we need to find
 
05:45:13.730 --> 05:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
creative ways to
 
05:45:16.010 --> 05:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
balance the needs of the various
 
05:45:16.020 --> 05:45:17.570 align:start position:0%
balance the needs of the various
stakeholders

05:45:17.570 --> 05:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
05:45:20.448 --> 05:45:20.458 align:start position:0%
um and this is doable I think I've
 
05:45:22.490 --> 05:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that when I started
 
05:45:24.170 --> 05:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
working at HUD
 
05:45:27.410 --> 05:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
um we would see developments with two or
 
05:45:27.420 --> 05:45:28.610 align:start position:0%
um we would see developments with two or
three

05:45:28.610 --> 05:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:45:31.430 --> 05:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
um investment participants by the time I
 
05:45:35.330 --> 05:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
left most of the projects had a dozen
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
um and we were balancing the needs of a
 
05:45:41.510 --> 05:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
dozen stakeholders but at least quite a
 
05:45:43.128 --> 05:45:43.138 align:start position:0%
few of those projects didn't move
 
05:45:47.208 --> 05:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
forward it is possible to do and I think
 
05:45:49.730 --> 05:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
it is something that we need to do I I
 
05:45:52.430 --> 05:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
still think we need to start with zoning
 
05:45:54.770 --> 05:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
um but then looking looking forward on
 
05:45:57.650 --> 05:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
other things and
 
05:45:59.990 --> 05:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
we need to consider everybody's feelings
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
not just the feelings of the people who
 
05:46:03.470 --> 05:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
are currently there
 
05:46:07.070 --> 05:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
um but uh for instance people who may be
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
moving from Massachusetts or who knows
 
05:46:10.080 --> 05:46:11.390 align:start position:0%
moving from Massachusetts or who knows
where

05:46:11.390 --> 05:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:46:14.090 --> 05:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
um to work in New Hampshire uh because
 
05:46:16.128 --> 05:46:16.138 align:start position:0%
they need jobs and they need places to
 
05:46:17.810 --> 05:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
live and the businesses that are trying
 
05:46:19.610 --> 05:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
to hire them need workers they need
 
05:46:22.910 --> 05:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
workers desperately we all know this
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
um so we have to put all of that
 
05:46:28.670 --> 05:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
together and not just say
 
05:46:31.128 --> 05:46:31.138 align:start position:0%
um well we'd rather not do X
 
05:46:32.690 --> 05:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
um there are things I'd rather not do
 
05:46:34.430 --> 05:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
either I wish I could get rid of that
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
pink stucco many more
 
05:46:39.530 --> 05:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
um but we have to consider uh what's
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:46:47.868 --> 05:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
so I want to preface this by saying my
 
05:46:50.690 --> 05:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
dream has always been now for 20 years
 
05:46:53.330 --> 05:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
to have a farm
 
05:46:55.850 --> 05:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
um my family is always rented I've
 
05:46:58.010 --> 05:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
always rented I don't know anybody who
 
05:46:59.810 --> 05:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
owns a home in my family I've never
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
owned a home it's always been the dream
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
I am deeply personally offended
 
05:47:08.030 --> 05:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
whenever I hear anyone and I don't mean
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
just comments today
 
05:47:11.448 --> 05:47:11.458 align:start position:0%
because I've heard it for many years
 
05:47:11.458 --> 05:47:13.548 align:start position:0%
because I've heard it for many years
that

05:47:13.548 --> 05:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is how we want our community to
 
05:47:17.090 --> 05:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
look we don't want those types of people
 
05:47:20.270 --> 05:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
we don't and and that we do this because
 
05:47:22.490 --> 05:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
we bought our home
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
10 20 30 40 50 years ago
 
05:47:29.810 --> 05:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
when the price of that home was one year
 
05:47:31.670 --> 05:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
of a median income single person median
 
05:47:31.680 --> 05:47:33.048 align:start position:0%
of a median income single person median
income

05:47:33.048 --> 05:47:33.058 align:start position:0%
income
 
05:47:35.690 --> 05:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
I I will say I doubt that there's
 
05:47:38.750 --> 05:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
anybody here maybe even alive that
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
remembers a time that housing has
 
05:47:44.330 --> 05:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
increased so much in terms of cost we
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
just heard doubling of rents in my
 
05:47:48.350 --> 05:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
community it's been tripling over the
 
05:47:50.628 --> 05:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
last few years just three years ago a
 
05:47:53.330 --> 05:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
two bedroom was 800 a two bedroom in
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
Newmarket now is 200 2 400 we had a
 
05:48:02.030 --> 05:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
whole building go from 725 to 1750 in a
 
05:48:04.030 --> 05:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
month because of a change of ownership
 
05:48:08.208 --> 05:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
so I I get deeply offended when I'm
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
being told by people who may have bought
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
their homes 40 years ago when it was
 
05:48:15.410 --> 05:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
super affordable that we want to
 
05:48:18.288 --> 05:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
increase and make it inaccessible to buy
 
05:48:20.750 --> 05:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
any land here to buy a home here because
 
05:48:22.610 --> 05:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
we want it to stay the way it's going
 
05:48:24.048 --> 05:48:24.058 align:start position:0%
well you know what populations change
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:31.670 --> 05:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
I feel excluded I feel like my needs
 
05:48:33.530 --> 05:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
don't count as a person I mean I live in
 
05:48:35.990 --> 05:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
a 700 square foot apartment and I still
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
dream of having a little farm but that
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
dream apparently isn't allowed to me
 
05:48:42.170 --> 05:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
because the people who got lucky by
 
05:48:44.690 --> 05:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
being born at the right time
 
05:48:47.690 --> 05:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
got in when it was good and went to set
 
05:48:49.490 --> 05:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
up the balls so that nobody else can
 
05:48:50.448 --> 05:48:50.458 align:start position:0%
come in
 
05:48:52.368 --> 05:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
so I get deeply hurt when I hear those
 
05:48:55.010 --> 05:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
kinds of comments I find it elitist and
 
05:48:56.570 --> 05:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
I find it to be the exact kind of
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
thinking that has got us to the
 
05:49:00.048 --> 05:49:00.058 align:start position:0%
situation today that we are in in the
 
05:49:02.030 --> 05:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
housing crisis that we are in
 
05:49:03.410 --> 05:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that kind of thinking
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
is going to get us out of it so that's
 
05:49:06.590 --> 05:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
what I have to say
 
05:49:06.600 --> 05:49:07.430 align:start position:0%
what I have to say
okay

05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:11.570 --> 05:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that I don't think we
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
have clearly enough
 
05:49:18.470 --> 05:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
identified in our work that we need to
 
05:49:20.150 --> 05:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
look at the money
 
05:49:20.160 --> 05:49:22.010 align:start position:0%
look at the money
so

05:49:22.010 --> 05:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:24.170 --> 05:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
agree that the adus are low-hanging
 
05:49:25.970 --> 05:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
fruit yes let's make that happen better
 
05:49:28.490 --> 05:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
yes there are zoning approaches
 
05:49:32.030 --> 05:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
to be dialogued and considered
 
05:49:34.310 --> 05:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
but the issue of
 
05:49:36.770 --> 05:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
how do we incentivize non-profit
 
05:49:40.010 --> 05:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
developers or others
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
to make these structures happen I think
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
we have to do work on that
 
05:49:44.878 --> 05:49:45.830 align:start position:0%
we have to do work on that
um

05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:47.150 --> 05:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
05:49:47.160 --> 05:49:49.850 align:start position:0%
that's all
okay

05:49:49.850 --> 05:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:53.470 --> 05:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
just pop your microphone on for us
 
05:49:55.680 --> 05:49:56.470 align:start position:0%
just pop your microphone on for us
please

05:49:56.470 --> 05:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:49:59.208 --> 05:49:59.218 align:start position:0%
I'm somewhat confused by the
 
05:50:00.708 --> 05:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
conversation because I missed this
 
05:50:03.650 --> 05:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
morning and I I haven't heard used guys
 
05:50:06.048 --> 05:50:06.058 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed here
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:12.708 --> 05:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
I'm fortunate that I live on a lake
 
05:50:15.590 --> 05:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
I worked hard for a number of years sold
 
05:50:17.930 --> 05:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
my sold my business and I moved to a
 
05:50:17.940 --> 05:50:19.128 align:start position:0%
my sold my business and I moved to a
lake

05:50:19.128 --> 05:50:19.138 align:start position:0%
lake
 
05:50:21.470 --> 05:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
but I also know that the family is owned
 
05:50:26.110 --> 05:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
a cottage on Barnstead lake for 40 years
 
05:50:29.990 --> 05:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
Barnstead Lake was never in the reach of
 
05:50:31.670 --> 05:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
an average person
 
05:50:34.970 --> 05:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
and a house is always a struggle for a
 
05:50:38.628 --> 05:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
person no matter what snapshot in time
 
05:50:41.030 --> 05:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
05:50:44.690 --> 05:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
so I I take someone I I love the fact
 
05:50:46.730 --> 05:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
that you would like to live on a farm I
 
05:50:49.070 --> 05:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
totally understand that I like that and
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
people should have
 
05:50:55.128 --> 05:50:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:55.138 --> 05:50:56.810 align:start position:0%
 
housing

05:50:56.810 --> 05:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
housing
 
05:50:59.510 --> 05:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
for most people is always a struggle and
 
05:51:01.250 --> 05:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
how and how they're going to be able to
 
05:51:02.690 --> 05:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
afford to do that
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
I've sat here with a lot of knowledge
 
05:51:07.730 --> 05:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
the government spent a lot of time on me
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
and educated me in Zoning for my town
 
05:51:13.730 --> 05:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
because we had no Zone the Lincoln
 
05:51:16.368 --> 05:51:16.378 align:start position:0%
Institute I could go on and on a
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful wonderful think tanks I've
 
05:51:22.850 --> 05:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
attended but I sat here one year and
 
05:51:25.128 --> 05:51:25.138 align:start position:0%
heard we're going to put a bill in that
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
is going to have five units on every law
 
05:51:29.810 --> 05:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
I knew that was good
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
so what do we do in the following year
 
05:51:33.470 --> 05:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
we say four units is the right number
 
05:51:35.628 --> 05:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm sitting there telling the people
 
05:51:37.548 --> 05:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
around me I can guarantee it's going to
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
be three next year
 
05:51:39.120 --> 05:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
be three next year
so

05:51:41.030 --> 05:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:43.850 --> 05:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot to be said
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
for this gentleman's view that I live in
 
05:51:47.868 --> 05:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
a town and you're not going to tell me
 
05:51:49.070 --> 05:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
05:51:52.430 --> 05:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
so I I think we need to find that mix of
 
05:51:54.770 --> 05:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
helping them I've I've been a lot of
 
05:51:58.430 --> 05:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
towns that have no idea when I when I
 
05:51:59.930 --> 05:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
told them what's happening in Dover
 
05:52:02.090 --> 05:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
their eyes just opened up they just had
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
no idea and that's literally just down
 
05:52:07.548 --> 05:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
the road from where I'm at so
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping we can do a primer I'm more
 
05:52:14.750 --> 05:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
than willing to work on that next step
 
05:52:16.250 --> 05:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's awesome
 
05:52:17.930 --> 05:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I didn't buy my house
 
05:52:23.330 --> 05:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
until 2005 just before the crash and I
 
05:52:25.610 --> 05:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
lost all my Equity Now it only needs a
 
05:52:26.750 --> 05:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars worth of
 
05:52:29.208 --> 05:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
repairs so it's not all it's cracked up
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
um but on a positive note and on an
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
encouraging side
 
05:52:36.770 --> 05:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
um as I said before supply and demand
 
05:52:39.530 --> 05:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
where these units need to be where does
 
05:52:41.990 --> 05:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
where are we short there was a study I
 
05:52:43.368 --> 05:52:43.378 align:start position:0%
saw not too long ago and I mentioned
 
05:52:45.410 --> 05:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
this on day one but this I'm mentioning
 
05:52:46.850 --> 05:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
it again today just so we have a
 
05:52:46.860 --> 05:52:47.930 align:start position:0%
it again today just so we have a
Direction

05:52:47.930 --> 05:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
Direction
 
05:52:49.970 --> 05:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
is that the majority of the communities
 
05:52:49.980 --> 05:52:51.410 align:start position:0%
is that the majority of the communities
in

05:52:51.410 --> 05:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:52:53.090 --> 05:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
South Central New Hampshire leading all
 
05:52:55.368 --> 05:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
the way up to Concord actually grew two
 
05:52:57.110 --> 05:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
to three hundred percent for their
 
05:53:00.890 --> 05:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
housing inventory except Nashua
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Concord they grew at
 
05:53:05.570 --> 05:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
about 40 percent so I was encouraged to
 
05:53:06.890 --> 05:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
hear Manchester's planning department
 
05:53:08.990 --> 05:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
here today and they are making some
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
strides because they are knocking down
 
05:53:12.890 --> 05:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
building after building and increasing
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
their their inventory at a much greater
 
05:53:16.440 --> 05:53:17.270 align:start position:0%
their their inventory at a much greater
rate

05:53:17.270 --> 05:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:53:19.190 --> 05:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate they didn't keep up the
 
05:53:20.570 --> 05:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
same rate as the rest of Southern New
 
05:53:21.770 --> 05:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we probably wouldn't
 
05:53:23.330 --> 05:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
be in the situation we're in right now
 
05:53:25.368 --> 05:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
we're at least not as bad so there is
 
05:53:27.230 --> 05:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
still encouraging things and it goes
 
05:53:28.910 --> 05:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
back to my proof that the communities
 
05:53:31.190 --> 05:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
and everybody who can see what's going
 
05:53:33.048 --> 05:53:33.058 align:start position:0%
on here uh they're all going to start
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
working on it on their own and already
 
05:53:36.470 --> 05:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
are so
 
05:53:38.690 --> 05:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
05:53:41.390 --> 05:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
um so as somebody who has to go bartend
 
05:53:44.448 --> 05:53:44.458 align:start position:0%
later I'm gonna try to wrap this up so
 
05:53:45.948 --> 05:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
um action items
 
05:53:47.930 --> 05:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace can you send us
 
05:53:50.090 --> 05:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
language for your
 
05:53:53.390 --> 05:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
um preemptive bill please
 
05:53:55.730 --> 05:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
um representative Reed can you get us
 
05:53:59.330 --> 05:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
some language maybe on 423 that can add
 
05:54:00.650 --> 05:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
some parking
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see some parking language on
 
05:54:05.390 --> 05:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
there and then send it to the committee
 
05:54:06.890 --> 05:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to reach out to the
 
05:54:11.208 --> 05:54:11.218 align:start position:0%
committee researcher it's like hello
 
05:54:11.218 --> 05:54:11.990 align:start position:0%
committee researcher it's like hello
um

05:54:11.990 --> 05:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
we want to put together some model
 
05:54:13.440 --> 05:54:15.048 align:start position:0%
we want to put together some model
policies

05:54:15.048 --> 05:54:15.058 align:start position:0%
policies
 
05:54:17.208 --> 05:54:17.218 align:start position:0%
um so we want to put together some maybe
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
reach out to Dover New Market some of
 
05:54:22.670 --> 05:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
these places from our committee that
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
we've found success and maybe put
 
05:54:24.718 --> 05:54:25.448 align:start position:0%
we've found success and maybe put
together

05:54:25.448 --> 05:54:25.458 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:54:28.070 --> 05:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
some policies that we would recommend
 
05:54:30.530 --> 05:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
but not mandate
 
05:54:33.650 --> 05:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
um and then I would also like to see the
 
05:54:37.010 --> 05:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
towns that do require impact fees uh
 
05:54:39.650 --> 05:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
what that looks like and um
 
05:54:41.868 --> 05:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
their policies around those
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:46.910 --> 05:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I will speak to Senator Innis
 
05:54:49.730 --> 05:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
regarding Senate Bill 78. Alyssa are you
 
05:54:51.590 --> 05:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with those developers can we
 
05:54:54.910 --> 05:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
talk about that offline okay
 
05:54:57.230 --> 05:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
perfect so Alyssa is probably
 
05:54:59.448 --> 05:54:59.458 align:start position:0%
coordinating their non-profit developers
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
right on the bill
 
05:55:04.368 --> 05:55:04.378 align:start position:0%
home builders Bill okay so I'll I'll
 
05:55:07.368 --> 05:55:07.378 align:start position:0%
connect with Alyssa regarding that bill
 
05:55:08.810 --> 05:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
I haven't had a chance to read it since
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
you emailed me but I'm definitely
 
05:55:13.970 --> 05:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay and is there anything else uh so
 
05:55:19.610 --> 05:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
