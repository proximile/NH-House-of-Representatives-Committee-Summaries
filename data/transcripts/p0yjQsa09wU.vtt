morning um welcome to
 
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
Monday um and we have several bills um
 
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.030 align:start position:0%
Monday um and we have several bills um
this

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
morning and uh the first is uh HB 12 9
 
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of the term
 
00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
evidence-based within public education
 
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
and uh Prime sponsor representative
 
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
beler is here and welcome
 
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 align:start position:0%
committee I am happy to be here to
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill as a Verbatim uh
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
copy of what was brought before this
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
Committee in the last
 
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
session this oh apologies for the record
 
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 align:start position:0%
represent of the beler Carol County
 
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
District 4 out of Wakefield and I will
 
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
should have pink cards
 
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
already so this bill got a somewhat
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
favorable hearing the last time around
 
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
we came out of committee uh no um
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
opinion going to the floor and I do hope
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
we can do a little better this time but
 
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take uh all of your
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions at the end it is a fairly
 
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
currently federal law um and rules
 
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
Define the term
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
evidence-based but they don't adequately
 
00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
Define what the evidence in
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
evidence-based actually
 
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
is this leads to problems um in terms of
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the evidence we're dealing
 
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
with actually reflects the reality or
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
the facts on the ground as to what is
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
actually occurring
 
00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
under the current
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
Paradigm objective evidence such as a
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
controlled study demonstrating increased
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
proficiency and better test scores is
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
given the same weight as a mere survey
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
asking administrators how they feel
 
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
about the efficacy of a
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
technique the first set of data is
 
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
objective and it represents good science
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
the second set of data is is
 
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
subjective and it represents not very
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
good science at all
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
presently teaching methods often are
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
legitimated utilizing the second
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
methodology of bad science they're often
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
legitimized using surveys instead of
 
00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.230 align:start position:0%
legitimized using surveys instead of
objective

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
objective
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
data when the data we're using to
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
evaluate is subjective bad science it
 
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't correspond to reality it or at
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
least it doesn't necessarily correspond
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
to reality and when it doesn't we wind
 
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
up with things like kids who can't read
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
properly this bill simply firms up that
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
definition of evidence to require that
 
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
the evidence we're using be good
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
I will note here that this only uh works
 
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
with pedagogy it doesn't cover subject
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
materials so there would no this bill
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak at all to what may be
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
taught in a classro it only speaks to
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
how we ought to be going about teaching
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
things in a classroom so it's about
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
material not only can we reasonably
 
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.110 align:start position:0%
material not only can we reasonably
expect

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
that this change in definition would
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
bring positive effects in student
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
learning and
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
proficiency we also stand to see
 
00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 align:start position:0%
significant cost savings if we were to
 
00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:11.990 align:start position:0%
significant cost savings if we were to
implement

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
this anyone with a background in
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
education probably understands the
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
frequency with which fads wind up
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
getting chased in the field people want
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
to conform to the current thing the
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
current in thing and best of the best
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
field and this also legitimizes the
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
publication of new texts on an ongoing
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
regular basis and the cost of
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
retraining by properly amending the
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
definition we can significantly curtail
 
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
this fad chasing within the field of
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
Education by doing so we limit the
 
00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
degree to which publishing of new
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
materials and retraining becomes
 
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
necessary in the field as we gravitate
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
more toward effective efficient ways of
 
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:05.879 align:start position:0%
doing business and teaching we get away
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
from fad
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
chasing uh lastly to the fiscal note I I
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't doubt that there might be some
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
small cost in implementing this
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
especially right off the bat um I don't
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
think it's probably necessary to have an
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
additional person involved because the
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
department is already doing this they're
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
already applying the rules from the
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
federal government on evidence-based uh
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
education this simply tweaks the
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
definition to make it a little firmer so
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
it's already something that's done uh
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it would be too
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to kick it up a higher gear
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
and continue doing it uh with this new
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
definition in place and with that I'm
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the
 
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
committee represent Woodcock thank you
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
chair welcome repres Al good to see you
 
00:08:59.069 --> 00:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
back again um like on the physical not I
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me most of the physical
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
notes that we receive from doe it's must
 
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
be an automatic placeholder it's
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
throwing another staff for another
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
$150,000 no matter what the issue is um
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you on that piece
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
however moving to the main text of the
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill um can you just explain to me a
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
little more clarity what you mean that
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
it it's only pedagogy and not subject
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
material yes thank you for that question
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to to delve into that so
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of when you teaching let's
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
say we're teaching um we're teaching
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
reading it doesn't have anything to do
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
with what reading materials can be
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
brought in it doesn't say this book over
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
that book or this text over that text
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
nothing of that kind it only affects the
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
manner in which the book is being taught
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
so for instance for those of you may be
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
familiar with the concept of queuing
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
well it it appears from my best
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
understanding of the science that the
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
queuing method of reading has been
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
largely discredited by good
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
science but it remains in many cases a
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
method that's utilized and perhaps
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
there's occasional methods where or
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
occasional times where it's useful I'm
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure but there are newer
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
methods utilizing um more phonics based
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
approaches that are more classical
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
really that have been demonstrated
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
according to my understanding of the
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
science to be more efficacious more
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
useful so in both in both ways you would
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
potentially be looking at the same book
 
00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
the same material it's just about how
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's being taught queing method versus
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
phonics so this would not affect the
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
material it only affects the methods and
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify all that you have to
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
be able to show is good science
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that the method works and
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be difficult at all
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
because we have colleges of Education
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
all across this country constantly doing
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
scientific studies looking at different
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
different pedagogical methods uh and
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
legitimizing them
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
via largely good science I'm sure
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
there's some bad stuff in there too but
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
largely good science so it shouldn't be
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
hard to find good methods that we can
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
science thanks chairman um on a
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
different topic thank you by the way
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
Mike on that different topic the fs in
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
education um sort of like the fs and
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
clothing my father always say don't
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
throw your ties away because the skinny
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
ones will be back okay but that being
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
said the fat and educ what is the
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
difference between a fat and education
 
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.110 align:start position:0%
difference between a fat and education
and

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
Improvement uh in instruction and things
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
that have changed because we've done
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
Empirical research and we see this may
 
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
be or we want to find out if we can do a
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
better job by changing the way the box
 
00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:46.430 align:start position:0%
better job by changing the way the box
is

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
built thank you and that's an excellent
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
question um so what we're dealing with
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
is is two methods of sort of
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
legitimating or saying this is the
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
reason this is true and correct on one
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
hand we have these sort of socially
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
negotiated method on the other hand we
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
had a science B based method on the
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
socially determined side of things is
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
where we get the concept generally of
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
fats that generally are adopted not
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
because they're being proven to be
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
efficacious but they're being adopted
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
because they're being adopted by other
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
people so everybody kind of jumps on the
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
bad bandwagon and tends to do the same
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
kind of thing now that doesn't
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that all fads are bad
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
because you could have a fad toward
 
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
something that's science-driven in which
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
cas there's nothing wrong with that but
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
the concept of a fat generally is sort
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
of scattershot maybe it hits maybe it
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
misses but when we bring good science in
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have to miss thank
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
you yes representative seling thank you
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
so much and thank you for taking my
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm just processing your
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
your information and I'm curious I think
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
back to when I was teaching kindergarten
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
and how you know I was in a situation
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
where I was able to teach all of my
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
students individually because we team
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
teaching so that I could teach reading
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
for example or math based on how each
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
individual student learned and I'm
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how that which I
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
guess you would say some of the methods
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
I Ed were not evidence-based because
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
they were what was developing then for
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
students who didn't particularly do well
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
with for example phonics based
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
instruction but needed whole language
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
instruction which is a totally different
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
reading strategy versus an organ gillium
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
approach and so I'm trying to figure out
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
how that relates to this
 
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
term and also what
 
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.949 align:start position:0%
term and also what
falsifiability

00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
falsifiability
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
means thank you for the question that
 
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question I was a
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
bit remiss in actually not covering that
 
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
in my introduction um
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
so the the scope of this bill is looking
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
to affect things that are adopted at the
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
level of the school boards and the state
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
it is not meant to jump into the
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
individual teachers classroom and tell
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
them that they can or cannot do X Y or Z
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
it actually specifically exempts
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
individual teachers and in individual
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
classrooms from the requirements of the
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill they can they if they feel there's
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
necess a necessity to do something they
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
can do it they don't have to justify it
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
based on the requirements of this bill
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of evidencebased they can just
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
do it um and I think that flexibility is
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think it's good um in
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
terms of the falsifiability that's a
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a term within the
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
scientific field of study that suggests
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
that whatever the proposition is you
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
have to be able to do some sort of
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
Investigation scientific analysis to
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it's false you
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
can't always prove something true but
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
you ought to be able to prove things are
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
false um so just a simple 10,000 foot
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
view you should be able to undertake a
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
scientific method-based approach to
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
determine what reading method works the
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
best for the largest group of
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
individuals maybe not universally but
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
you could say okay which works best and
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
if a method is bad you should be able to
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
show scientifically that okay this
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't really work but things that
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
aren't falsifiable would be like
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
um big claims that have to do with
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
metaphysics um and certain
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
epistemological claims like
 
00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.990 align:start position:0%
epistemological claims like
um

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with religion and things of
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
that nature so it sets aside things that
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
falsifiable um in terms of things that
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
are falsifiable and things that are
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
falsifiable are necessarily items that
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
method for the questions yes
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman thank you Mr
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
bringing this in front of us um for
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
those of us who want educate is I
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you're breaking
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
this down into more Layman's language um
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
my question to you would uh is that um
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
would the state standardized testing
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
qualify as a scientific study
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um for the question the the
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
testing in itself is not a scientific
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
study because it's not designed as a
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
study but it could be a portion of a
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
scientific study so and I and I expect
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
it often is the portion of a scientific
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
study where College of Education or some
 
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
organization will undertake a study that
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
looks at okay this is we're going to
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
make this change we're going to attempt
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
to design this study to control for all
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
of these uh other variables that that
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
impact it and we're going to have our
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
measurement based on uh test scores and
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
you can put those together and if the
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
study is is welld designed you can you
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
can reasonably correlate the change to
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
the test scores so yes in that
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
way yes representative welcome
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
back or welcome to this committee anyway
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
question if I understood you correctly
 
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
when you were responding to repres
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sal's
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
query you're indicating that the bill
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
applies to boards and
 
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.630 align:start position:0%
applies to boards and
state

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
um efforts not to individual
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
teachers can you direct me where in the
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
bill we can understand that it doesn't
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
apply to individual teachers I'm not
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
perceiving that uh yes give me just a
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you look at under um Roman
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
numeral one it identifies the scope to
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
who this um is applying and it it
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
defines educator training policies and
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
any ped pedagogical methods attached to
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
or accompaning
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum adopted by the Department of
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
Education local school districts and any
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
other regulatory body that may prescribe
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
teaching methods so specifically left
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
out of that was individual teachers
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
Within their
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
classrooms follow thank
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
you so I appreciate you highlighting
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
that and I would be
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that by not actually stating
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't apply to individual
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you representive
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
Cornell so in fact if a school district
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
passed um
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
ways of how they want things taught and
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
a teacher decided no I'm not going to do
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
that um because this works better isn't
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
that teacher opening themselves up to
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
being insubordinate or not following
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
rules and being
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
reprimanded thank you uh I I would
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
imagine so um this bill does not seek to
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
at all touch the educator code of uh
 
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
conduct or any sort of practices within
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
the district regarding that um this
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
simply says that under this bill that
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
would be allowable the school school
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
boards are certainly authorized on their
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
own to decide if something steps outside
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
of the scope of what they consider
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable thank you um I had one
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
question um You referred to Roman uh
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
numeral one um where it indicates that
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
the content the curriculum is not um
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
impacted by this requirement um but in
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 it says that districts shall
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
make scientific studies um available and
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
If the curriculum provider is a third
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
party the department may require the
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
provider the curriculum provider to
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
furnish studies that the that they are
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh evidencebased so it sounds like you
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
are in Roman 4 talking about curriculum
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you for the question
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
and this is that little bit of a area
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
where there's a small overlap that
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
occurs between pedagogi and curriculum
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
and that occurs because uh textbook
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
providers for instance will often
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
include um not merely material but they
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
will include uh instruction guidance for
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
how to go about teaching something and
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
if they're going to be including such
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
instruction guidance that is PED
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh pedagogy as opposed to content so it
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
would fall under the scope of this bill
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
and rather than requiring that the local
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
body go out and find the studies they
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
this simply authorizes them to go to
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
that Textbook Company and require them
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
to furnish them with whatever studies
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
they used to legitimize placing that
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
within those
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
texts and if um the uh provider does not
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
want to include uh
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh provide information to a little old
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
Governor when we're School District um
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
what is the um
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
result that's a very good question I
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
from my understanding in textbooks which
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
is not huge but there's some um they
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
don't just tend to willy-nilly pick
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
things and to throw in there that are
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
not being associated with some formal
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
method of pedagogy and as long as there
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
is that formal method of pedagogy
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
there's going to be scientific um
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
evidence and scientific studies for it
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
that can be pointed to if they choose
 
00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:06.669 align:start position:0%
that can be pointed to if they choose
not

00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
to then the um adopting uh department or
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
SAU would certainly have the recourse of
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
of going elsewhere or coming to this
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
body for any sort of
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
um additional requirements down the road
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative Corell um to get back
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal no um I agree that maybe
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
it won't cost um the doe another person
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
to do it although I know that they have
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
a lot to do but it does say the
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
department States this will increase
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
local expenditures by an indeterminable
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
amount um in 2026 in each year
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
thereafter so isn't this just another
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
bill downshifting cost to the local
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers which is something that we
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
really are trying not to do because I
 
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
know my my property taxes went up a a
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
lot and this will just increase my
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
property taxes again if it has to be
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
absorbed by the towns and the
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
cities uh thank you for the question I
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
would say um no and no no on two fronts
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
so first of all the idea I I'm not sure
 
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
I necessarily agree with the idea of
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
downshifting because um we're talking
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
about money that's coming out of the
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
pockets of taxpayers whether it goes to
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
the state first then the locality or the
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
locality it's it's it's still the tax
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's covering the cost of education
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
but to go a little more in in depth on
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
the why what we're looking at here is
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
the reason that you might not be able to
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
determine immediate cost is because they
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
can't be 100% certain how many methods
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
that are currently in use might not be
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
science-based which frankly seems like a
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good reason to spend a little bit
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
of money if we need to to update our
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
methods to bring them in line with the
 
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
latest science in order to make the best
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
children represent
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you again Mr chair and thank
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering how this
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
would apply or
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
affect the actual research process so
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
for example if
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
UNH is doing pedagogy research which I
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
believe they do and they need students
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
to do that research
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
with probably those students are
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
receiving education through the public
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
school system that you're directing this
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
at so are they then curtailed from doing
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
the research that you're promoting as
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
the premise for this bill
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
because the science of that particular
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
pedagogy has not yet been established
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
that's the point of the re SE
 
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
Arch thank you for the question I would
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
say first no it really is not looking to
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
restrict the ability to conduct research
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
in in any way however to get specific to
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
the point you're making I would suggest
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
that if there is any entity making a
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we make a significant
 
00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
departure from accepted best practices
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
and standards um in our public school
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
students in order to conduct a study on
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
them we ought to have some reason to
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
believe that that's going to work that
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
can be pointed to and say this is some
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
good evidence that suggests this ought
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
to work um otherwise we're just kind of
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
treating kids like Lab Rats which is not
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
an ethical thing I would
 
00:25:42.919 --> 00:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
an ethical thing I would
think

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
follow so where and how does that I'll
 
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
call it preliminary research happened to
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
establish enough evidence that then it
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
would fit your standard for what could
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
um be researched with the students thank
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
you so we're getting into some some
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
really um important detailed but they're
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
also sort of edge cases what I would say
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
first is that the the totality of the
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
body of of uh evidence that's out there
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
is so significant it's so large that you
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
generally ought to be able to point to
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
some studies that say if if the if what
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do is legitimate in any
 
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
way you really should be able to point
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
to some studies to say okay this looks
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
like we a method we should be utilizing
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
for this reason and in such cases where
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
you can point to such evidence you
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
should be able to proceed with the um
 
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
with the research um as far as trying to
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
concoct really you know different
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
thinking kind of stuff
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
um that is going to be something that I
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
would argue shouldn't be just broadly
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
inflicted upon public school students
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
when we don't know what what kind of
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes we're going to expect we have
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
such a broad um body of evidence to draw
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
from at this point that we can look and
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
find good methods within what exists and
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
then take the next steps that take the
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
current evidence and take steps Beyond
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
it without completely trying to reinvent
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
the wheel and and potentially do great
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
harm to
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
students repr s thank you and thank
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
sorry it takes me a little while
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes to process all the questions
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm curious whether the state has um the
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
state department of education has
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
approved curriculum that you would
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
consider not
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and and how you would
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
determine that from all of the various
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum they've approved from K
 
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
12 thank you are there currently things
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
fit yes that the state has approved that
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
do not specifically fit this I can't be
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
100% certain I do know in my own
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
research that there are broadly some
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
Fields within education that Trend more
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
toward subjective analysis than
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
objective analysis in terms of
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
legitimating certain techniques and
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
different teaching methods um but as far
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
as determining that down the road I'm
 
00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
not going to be doing it um there is
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
some oversight capacity clearly within
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
this body to be able to watch over that
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
whole thing but that's something that is
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
within the bill for us to write the law
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
that the executive then executes so it
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
would be over on their side of the the
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
building that they uh conduct those sort
 
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.950 align:start position:0%
building that they uh conduct those sort
of

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
analyses thank you for taking my
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
followup could you give me an example of
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
something that you think would be a
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
subjective thing that's been approved
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
because I'm not clear on what you mean
 
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
by that sure um it's been my
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
understanding that especially when it
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
comes to some of the reading methods
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
that were popularized in the last maybe
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
20 30 years ago that there was an
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
emphasis placed not on objective score
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
metrics as far as can you read better
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
can we demonstrate that you read better
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
but we're legitimized through surveys
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
happening um in more recent times I
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
think there are portions of fields such
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
as trauma informed education social
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
emotional learning that Trend not
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
entirely but certainly in some cases
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
Trend toward subjective methods of
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation instead of the objective
 
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
metrics representative McDonald thank
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and welcome back to
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
education representative am I correct in
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
saying that this would not prevent
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
students from being asked to take
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
surveys in school it simply just pre
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
prevents their surveys from being
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
presented as evidence-based when it's
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
self-reported data correct this this
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with a
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on on surveys or anything of
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
the kind great thanks
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.190 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
much

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
Banfield hit the
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
but uh my name is Amry Banfield I am a
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
parental rights Advocate focused on
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
excellence and
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
education today I come here in support
 
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.389 align:start position:0%
education today I come here in support
of

00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
hb29 some of my background involves
 
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
tutoring elementary and middle school
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
children in mathematics I also had the
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
pleasure of participating in an online
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
Forum with mathematicians and Math
 
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
teachers from around the country for
 
00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
those of you who remember the math Wars
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
about 15 years ago this for was set up
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
to promote quality math curriculum and
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
pedagogi in in
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
schools the mathematicians who
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
participated were some of the best and
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
brightest working at our top
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
universities needless to say I just kind
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
of watched and listened and asked
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
questions um they reviewed math
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
curriculum and pedagogia in detail and
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
identified the numerous problems within
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
some of the back then it was
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
textbooks the problems they pointed out
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
were exactly the problems I saw when I
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
was teaching kids math math if you're
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
going to expect kids to discover math
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
you better expect them to have to be
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
able to um access a tutor as kids don't
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
discover math today I'm in a I'm on a
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
forum with Math teachers from around the
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
country who gather to share ideas on
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
teaching math they talk about teaching
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
methods that have had a positive impact
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
on learning and share information about
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
some of the fattish teaching methods
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
that do not work well in the
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
classroom what I learned from teaching
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
children myself is that children need a
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
good quality math program and a good
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
teacher I do not subscribe to the idea
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
that kids can discover math on their own
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
while there may be a few outliers most
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
kids need direct instruction or their
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
parents will end up paying for a
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
tutor this idea that teachers should be
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
guides on the side marginalizes the
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
value of teachers in our
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
classroom too many teachers are
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
floundering and looking for Quality
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
information on teaching methods and
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
quality math programs
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
grateful that these teachers are
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
collaborating to find math programs and
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
teaching methods that will help them
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
fill the
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
gaps I think HB 129 is attempting to
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
identify good quality teaching methods
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
so teachers are not having to search for
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
this on their own I'm also going to
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
point to uh a position statement that I
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
have here by the El elth althia Society
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
the althia society is committed to
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
advocacy rooted in rigorous research SE
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
Arch and evidence they believe the most
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
effective advocacy is Guided by data and
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
insights that inform policy and practice
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
in special education and the related
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
fields so this is a position statement
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
in response to the nctm the National
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
Council of teachers of
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
mathematics so in the position so in
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
their position statement they're they're
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
replying to the um
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
nctm they say a position statement from
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
two national organizations the NC TM
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
teachers of mathematics and the C
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
Council for exceptional children focused
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
on the teaching of mathematics to all
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities is timely
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
given the strong research base in
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
special education about mathematics the
 
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
focus on c teacher preparation standards
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
about the use of research validated
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
practices and the focus in both General
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
and special education legislation about
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
the use of research validated practices
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
the expect is that such a position
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
statement would rely on a consensus of
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
current evidence in the field
 
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the nctm and the C
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
position statement falls short falls
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
falls well short of this expectation the
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
nctm and the C position statement
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
provided a list of actionable
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the mathematics
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
support of students with disabilities
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
however many of these recommendations
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
were merely beliefs and philosophy
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
without significant and rigorous
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
research to support them we expected
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
better from a position statement meant
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
to inform the crucial and complex
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
practice of providing mathematics
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
education for all students with
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities and thus call for position
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
statement that is grounded in now
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
considerable knowledge-based of
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
effective mathematics instructions for
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
students with
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities in 2021 The whatw Works
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
Clearing House produced a highquality
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
revieww in which some of the research on
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
assisting students who experience
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
difficulties with mathematics was
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
considered the wwc review resulted in
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
six recommendations with strong levels
 
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.270 align:start position:0%
six recommendations with strong levels
of

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
evidence yet only one of these
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations in other words
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
mathematical representations was
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the nctm position statement
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
we would expect a position statement for
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities to focus on
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
all six recommendation including
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
representations mathematics vocabulary
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
number line computation fluency word
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
problem solving and system systemic
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
explicit instruction among the many
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
omissions from this position statement
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
is an emphasis on
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
systemic explicit instruction in the
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
high leverage practice documentation
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
from CEC the practice with the strongest
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
research base to support its use with
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
students with
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities it's not much longer but
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stop
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
here if you go to the American
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
Confederation of teachers website you're
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
going to find a a uh a study and it's
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's about um it's called putting
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
students on a path to learning and it is
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
a study that shows that guided
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
instruction is the best method of
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
teaching math in our
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
schools representative beler brought up
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
how some of these programs in our
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
schools dictate pedagogy he might not
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
have used that word but I will use it
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
they dictate pedagogy to the teachers
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
you open up a program and the program
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
says use inquiry based learning well
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's key that's code for get yourself
 
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.710 align:start position:0%
that's key that's code for get yourself
a

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
tutor and not all of these kids can
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
afford tutors not all of these parents
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
can go and hire tutors so what happens
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
is those kids fall through the cracks
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
when the teacher is not teaching but is
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
told is sometimes told yes sometimes
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
they are told you have to do it this way
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to have to do it that
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
way unfortunately if that's what they're
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
being told
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
but my I I think the point of this is
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
let's narrow down what is evidence-based
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
what is research based so that at least
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
they're not floundering around trying to
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
figure out because this is what they've
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
been told works and then they're seeing
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
it in their own class that it's not
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
working so that's my um statement if you
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'm happy to to
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
provide them
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
um I I've just seen it personally I've
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
seen it personally this this idea of
 
00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:32.599 align:start position:0%
this project based learning in math and
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
inquiry based learning um it
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
marginalizes the teacher in the
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
classroom and I don't understand it
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
because our teachers are professionals
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
they go to school to to to teach this
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then they're sidelined
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
sidelined and that doesn't help students
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
but it certainly helps tutors if that's
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
what if that's what you want to do thank
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
you any questions
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
yes Reb Paul you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
take my question so is this uh your idea
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
about not doing inquir based learning
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
and stuff is that for special needs only
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
that you're speaking about are you
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
speaking students absolutely not all
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
students and again you know I I I like
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
that there's an exception that the
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
teacher can divert from that if so be
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
because when you're talking about a
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
gifted student um they have that
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
capacity a lot of times they you know I
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
don't get the kids I didn't get the kids
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
who were gifted in math matter of fact
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
my son's gifted in math and guess what
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
he would do cuz they we my kids were in
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
a school back then that used this pedoi
 
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
all of his friends would call him at
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
night asking him to explain the math
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
that the teacher refused to teach now
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
this woman was an amazing woman this
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
teacher she was told use this
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
constructivism use this pedagogy in the
 
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:53.079 align:start position:0%
classroom and so he'd come home some of
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
the kids I was tutoring some of the kids
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
would call him and say can you explain
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
how this works
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times what happens is your
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
gifted kids can work their way through a
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
system like that they can figure it out
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
so in a class like that where you say
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
that you separate the kids maybe that's
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
something that those kids don't need as
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
as much as explicit instruction but even
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
still my son who is gifted in math would
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
still come home frustrated angry at a
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
teacher who is an amazing person but she
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
was told she had to do it this way so
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
the frustration and the Ang is aimed
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
towards the teacher parents are calling
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
the teacher why aren't you teaching my
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
kids why aren't you teaching them math
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so this is this is Manifest itself
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
so I'd get these kids I'd actually teach
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
them and I learn what it means to be a t
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
teacher at that point because when that
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
light bulb goes out and when that
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
self-esteem improves because somebody's
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
actually teaching them it's like it's
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
like um a foreign language do you just
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
figure out a foreign language so
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes you pretty much have to be
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
taught what the words mean and so um
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
what I what what I like about this and
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes I see it in the programs I analyze
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
math programs all the time and it's in
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
there it tells the teachers how to teach
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
it's in the grants I don't know if you
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
know this but sometimes when we when we
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
um get grants in the schools it's
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
dictating pedagogi in those grants that
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
takes away the autonomy from the teacher
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
so yeah I do want a teacher to be able
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
to you know maneuver at the same same
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
time thank you that Mak sense
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for taking my question
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
sure could you clarify again for me I've
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
got a little confused by the words
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
access a
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
tutor just I'm I'm missing I I know what
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
you're saying about a tutor but I'm not
 
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
completely understanding why a tutor
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
would be doing the job that I know I
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
always did um as far as using techniques
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
um accessing a tutor would mean that if
 
00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
that a student is in that environment in
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
a classroom where they are using the
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
discovery constructivism inquiry method
 
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
Project based learning those kind of
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
those kind of situations where which is
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
teaching methods
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
pedagogi uh where they're not actually
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
learning or or they're not understanding
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
because maybe they're working with
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
groups of kids and they're not really
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
understanding how to work work through a
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
math concept then a lot of times then
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
that's how I would get students so it
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
was sometimes it's the curriculum
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a teaching method
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's both help my child
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
because this is what's going on in the
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
classroom and the anger aim towards the
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
teachers and I'm always like don't
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily blame the teacher they
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
didn't pick the curriculum and a lot of
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
times they're told this is what they
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
have to do thank you uh representative
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you very short question what
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
is the name of the society that you were
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
quoting their position
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
statement the National Council teacher
 
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.510 align:start position:0%
statement the National Council teacher
of

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
mathematics um the althia society it's a
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
l t h EI I a and I'm going to give you a
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
copy of this so that you can look at it
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
and then at the same time I would also
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
go read this position statement you know
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'm going to email it to you because
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
it's got links in it also the position
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
by the nctm that they're criticizing
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representa Terry I'm sorry um
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
one second followup sorry thank you
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for sending that and would you
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
also include the link to the position
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
statement that you're responding to yes
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely repr Terry thank
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
you uh at one at at one point in your
 
00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:52.559 align:start position:0%
testimony um in your your narrative I
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
believe that you mentioned that um there
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
were six recommendations that were made
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
by was it the National Council of Math
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
teachers to a higher governing body five
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
of which were either rejected or ignored
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
only one of which was
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
adopted can
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
you do you have any idea or do you
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
know uh why the other five were not
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
either responded to positively or
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
rejected and um what they they are and
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
how this bill would address um the
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
concerns of the ncmt that were ignored
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
or rejected by the har governing body I
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
I brought this as an example mainly as
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
an example of the difficulty Within
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
These societies within um the nctm
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
within a a society like this that that
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
represents the students with
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities um how will it impact this
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
this particular how will it impact the
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill um I think it's just an example of
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
why it's needed why we need to narrow
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
down the evidence base why I think it's
 
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
good for public schools to narrow it
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
down because at the same time you've got
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know you've got these situations
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
where for instance in Manchester if this
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
is what they're doing in a classroom
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
these kids may not have access to a
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
tutor so if you are uh now somebody in
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
Bedford they might be able to afford a
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
tutor but the point is is if we can
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
narrow down what actually works well in
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
pedagogi um and again that aft uh the
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
what's on the AFT American Federation of
 
00:44:46.589 --> 00:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
teachers I'll send that too um it is a
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
study that shows that guided instruction
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
works best in the classroom and I I feel
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
like it's um it's very uh it I just have
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
a strong belief just sitting with kids
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
and looking at all of the documentation
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
and evidence
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
that this attempt to remove a teacher
 
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.950 align:start position:0%
that this attempt to remove a teacher
from

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
instruction not completely not
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
completely um has really damaged it's
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
been going on the nctm has been highly
 
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
criticized by the mathematicians I
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
worked with 15 years ago I can send you
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
that information some of you may have
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
already read it because I've included
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
I've sent it to the to the commissioner
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the past so I'm happy to send you
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
that but yes the nctm has been a a major
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
problem in math education they came up
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
with the fuzzy math standards back 20
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
years ago and they were highly
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
criticized by these mathematicians
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
around the country so we were you and I
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
think that they had the evidence to
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
prove it if you look at the Tims test
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
we're 25th in in on International scores
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is what they would point to the
 
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
nctm that has been involved with math
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
education in this country so you're
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
asking me to say why why would they do
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
something like that why would they do
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
that now you're asking me to get into
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
their head and I don't think that I
 
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
could provide you a a honest answer I
 
00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:10.910 align:start position:0%
could provide you a a honest answer I
could

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
guess I could guess I mean I to me I've
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
just I have I would I would never trust
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
them from from years ago when and I mean
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
these mathematicians were well I'll I'll
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
send you information on it thank you
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
follow up quickly please so so I I I
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear um you are not
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
aware of why the recommendations were
 
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
rejected leading to your frustration and
 
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
the frustration of other Educators who
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
hold views similar to or the same as as
 
00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:46.430 align:start position:0%
hold views similar to or the same as as
yours

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
yours
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
um so so does this bill would this bill
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
be helpful to you in attempting to move
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
in the direction of resolving that
 
00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:57.470 align:start position:0%
in the direction of resolving that
frustration

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
and achieving the laudable objectives
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
which you are stating for us today I
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
believe it would I believe that there's
 
00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
enough evidence out there to promote
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
good quality pedagogi in the schools I
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
think there's enough evidence out there
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
to promote good math programs in the
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
school but that's not what this bill is
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
doing so yes I do believe that that
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
would that would be I think the
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
criticism a lot of times nctm is all
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
about hands off teachers you know let
 
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
kids Discovery discover learning and so
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
what they're basically doing is saying
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
you're not including information good
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
information like maybe um what the afts
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
on their website to counter what their
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
position statement was what they put out
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
there and this has been going on for
 
00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:46.839 align:start position:0%
decades with the
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
nctm thank you very much see no further
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and that will end the hearing
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
on hb29 and and I am going to turn the
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
gavel over to representative dry for the
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
right we're going to take a couple
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
minutes to get straightened out and move
 
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:55.710 align:start position:0%
minutes to get straightened out and move
around

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:25.710 align:start position:0%

my best this time around to not
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
triggered an earthquake with my
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
promises okay I suspect everyone here is
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
familiar at least in a basic way with
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
the foundational facts that uh regarding
 
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
the incident that precipitated this
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
resolution for those needing refresher
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
or more details there are two media
 
00:53:59.950 --> 00:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
articles containing uh details that I
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
have passed around you can peruse that
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
at your
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
leisure first it is within the purview
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
of this body as the grand inquest of the
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
state to remove remove any office holder
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
in either state or Local
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
Government after all it is this state in
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
this state according to our Constitution
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
and judicial precedent localities have
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
no authorities not granted to them by
 
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
this legislative
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
body if we can create a position by
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
Statute as we have here we have
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
oversight of that
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
position second this is a resolution
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
calling for a removal for
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
cause that cause is severalfold
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
the actions taken represent politization
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the position and the adoption of a
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
protected class of
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
rules adopted not by this
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
body but by the locality and in
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
contravention of this
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
body the parents in question that were
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
impacted by the
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
incident were charged with
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
harassment by the superintendent in
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
question in this
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
position and severely punish in actions
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
were taken based off of that
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
charge I have included with the handouts
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
harassment I've been cut off I won't
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
read the whole law please do peruse it
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
you will find that the allegations made
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
against the parents in question for the
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
behavior in question meets
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
none of the items outlined in New
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%

further the punishments inflicted

including a total prohibition of parents

stepping foot on school grounds for any
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
reason is an outlandish punishment that
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
ought to be reserved only for legitimate
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
threats and ought to include due process
 
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:49.799 align:start position:0%
of law for deprivation of a liberty
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
interest on on the part of that
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
parent the prohibition rendered so far
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
exceeded both the authority of the
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
position of superintendent and the
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
punishments themselves so far exceeded
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
any reasonable application in the
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances that this cannot be viewed

as anything other than politically
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%

thank you I would be happy to take
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh yes I'm going to
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
as representative Hall thank you madam
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
chair and and thank you representative
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
U given that this is in the courts right
 
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
now um given that it targets a specific
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
individual did you get any push back at
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
Os or in the speaker's office with this
 
00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.109 align:start position:0%
Os or in the speaker's office with this
legislation

00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
or thank you for the question there was
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
push back isn't the right word there was
 
00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:21.390 align:start position:0%
push back isn't the right word there was
some

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
um understanding difficulties in
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
crafting this bill under what section of
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
law in the Constitution this was falling
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
under because this is not merely a
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution that is the manner
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
in which it is drafted but
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
constitutionally this falls under a bill
 
00:59:36.599 --> 00:59:39.029 align:start position:0%
constitutionally this falls under a bill
of

00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
address representative sik thank you
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for taking my
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
question um I'm trying to understand
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
where your motivation comes from given
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
that you don't live in this District you
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
don't um as far as I understand have
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
children in this school district you're
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
not part of this District you're from a
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
Community 45 miles away and what uh what
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
would make this relevant to to you given
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
that it's not something wouldn't it be
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
an issue for local control and for the
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
local community to take their own
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
personal stance about their support of
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
their superintendent thank you for the
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
question absolutely not we cannot sit by
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
as Representatives at the state level of
 
01:00:20.349 --> 01:00:20.359 align:start position:0%
government while the rights of citizens
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the state are trampled by
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
local government it is within our
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
purview to oversee local government and
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
as I said as a Dylan's rule state local
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
government only has the authority
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
granted them by this body otherwise they
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
exist representative
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
NATO thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question so reading all of
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
this and I've heard a little bit more
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
about it but
 
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
um this uh parent is obviously concerned
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
for his daughter's better welfare as B
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
in point of the Olympics and the boxing
 
01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
competition uh I kind of agree with that
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're not saying uh you can't play
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
sports just that there is a point in
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
time where the physical ability is a
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
quite different uh as far as strength
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
and ability uh and one of the point of
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
order I I don't think that's what this
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
bill is about and I think it's point of
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
order that that it's it's a different
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
discussion for a different bill I I
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that's what we're here to
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
talk about could you phrase a question
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
that directly addresses the
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
topic okay so you think his uh freedom
 
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.910 align:start position:0%
topic okay so you think his uh freedom
of

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
speech would be relevant
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
here thank you for the question yes I do
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
I think I think a host of uh freedoms
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
covered under the First Amendment to the
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution as well as the New
 
01:01:57.069 --> 01:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire con tion are implicated here
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
including freedoms of speech and
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
Association and of the right to petition
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
one's government yes thank you
 
01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.950 align:start position:0%
one's government yes thank you
representative

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you madam chair um good
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
to see you again twice in one day
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
um I want to move away from the issue
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
the the topical issue that caused this
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh concern but more to the hiring firing
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
practice of a local school committee I
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
would think that having been in
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
education in schools for Way beond Way
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
Beyond three decades that those
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
authorities lay a lie with the local
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
school board to hire or fire
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent or assistant
 
01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent or business manager then
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
of course a recommendation
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent on the way down so I
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand honestly why we would I
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
understand your concern about people's
 
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
rights in your position I understand I'm
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
not suting it's not legal I'm suggesting
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
that the school board has an authority
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
to make a determin if they want to hire
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
a person fire a person under the
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
Collective bodying Agreement and if it's
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
an individual contract the
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's their sole right
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
to do that so I don't know why we would
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to oversee or override the the
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
provisions of the local school board
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with the local uh in this case
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
superintendent forgetting the issue
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
specifically but rather the the idea
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question I
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
think it's a perfectly Fair argument to
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
suggest that one would rather see such a
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
decision left to the local school board
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
however from a process standpoint we
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
have the authority to look at this issue
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
because any person anywhere in the state
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
who believes their rights are being
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
deprived by a local body has the right
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
to appeal to a higher body of government
 
01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:41.870 align:start position:0%
to appeal to a higher body of government
for

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
redress that's what's happened here
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking to a higher body at the
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
state level to redress what wasn't
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
handled at the local level and there is
 
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:52.839 align:start position:0%
great historical precedent for this in
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
the 18th century sorry 19th century uh
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
mid 19th century a County coroner was
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
process

01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
follow 1800 corer as we talking big
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
this I understand the the piece but um I
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
guess the falling up the same
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
piece we're not trying to
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
redress the decision by the
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent nor the right of the
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
parents to do what they think is right I
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
have no issue with that what I have the
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
issue with is that we're trying to tell
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
the local school board how to deal with
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
their superintendent that's not an our
 
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
issue we have the do we have the legal
 
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
right absolutely should we putting our
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
feet in that water absolutely
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
not my opinion thank you I don't think
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
there was a question I appreciate the
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
opinion representative
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
question would you
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
comment on what kind of precedent if
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
this resolution were to pass this
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
sets in including in your response
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
relative to as you cited Dylan's
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
rule I am very concerned that this sets
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
a precedent that state government could
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
be involved in the hiring and firing of
 
01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:16.390 align:start position:0%
be involved in the hiring and firing of
any

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
local locally hired person for any
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
position whatsoever if there's a
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
grievance thank you I am very hopeful to
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
say exactly such a precedent that we
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
might step in to directly remove holders
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
of office from any position in the state
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
where they have deprived citizens of
 
01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:39.950 align:start position:0%
where they have deprived citizens of
their

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
Liberties do you also incorporate in
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
your now stated objection to remove
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
holders of
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
office all kinds of employees I was
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
actually I appreciate that information
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
but that's not what I was asking I was
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
asking about hired individuals Not
 
01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.549 align:start position:0%
asking about hired individuals Not
Elected

01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
Elected
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you and to make that
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
distinction clear there's only under the
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
government there's only two types of
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
persons there's elected and there's
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
appointed to office all office holders
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
including employees are office holders
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
government follow up go
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
ahead I don't think I got the answer to
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
the question thank you for the
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
clarification on the
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
terminology but I'm trying to understand
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
what you expect as precedent
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
for every
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
employee however you uh Define them of a
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
school district of a municipality so if
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
I don't like the care of the roads in my
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
town and to be clear I think my town
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
roads are very well cared for
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
um then can I petition to have the state
 
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
remove my road
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
agent absolutely people can petition for
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
anything and by right of our
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
constitution we have the authority to do
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
but it would have to meet the necessary
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
threshold in both this body and in the
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
happen representative
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
you representative for coming in front
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
of us I think it's very important that
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
people understand that we all have
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
rights um can you cite referencer in
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
your research have you found any other
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
instances of the state getting involved
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
in Schoolboard matters at this
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
level thank you for your question I'm
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
not aware of any uh direct involvement
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
in removal of a school hired Personnel
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the school board but the school board
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
exists under the same uh rubric of
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
government as a County government or a
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
local government does it's under the
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
state so
 
01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
only there would be no legal or
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue as far as pursuing
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
somebody within any um aspect of state
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%

minutes mam chair I'd be happy to thank

you good
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair members of the
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jerry FW the
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
associate executive director of the New
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school administrators
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
Association I come before you that to
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
this hearing to ask that you deem a HCR
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
6 as inexpedient to legislate and here's
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
why it's not this body's responsibility
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate free speech that belongs
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
in another branch of government the
 
01:09:10.829 --> 01:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
hiring and firing of a local school
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent is the responsibility of
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
the local school board not the
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
legislature this body doesn't
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily know the facts or that are
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
surrounding that incident being debated
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
nor is it necessarily familiar with the
 
01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
law local school board's
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
policy whose enforcement responsibility
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent judgments and decisions
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
needed to be made at at that time based
 
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
on the school district policy and
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately with the obligation to
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
provide a safe environment for students
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
and others gathered at a school event
 
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
the end of the day this resolution
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
exceeds the responsibility of this body
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
erodes the duties and resp
 
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of a local school
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
district and makes assumptions based on
 
01:10:01.709 --> 01:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
a lack of knowledge of The Facts of the
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
matter we ask that the wisdom of this
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
committee Prevail and determine this
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
bill as an expedient to legislate thank

you um representative belter made the
 
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
statement that he thought the state
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
should have the authority to override a
 
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
school district or other local
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
government elected bodies hiring and
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
firing decisions do you agree that
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's an
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate action thank you for the
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
question representative Su I claim not
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
to be a constitutional uh specialist and
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh would not be uh comfortable offering
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
an opinion on
 
01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
that representative mois thank you madam
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
chair um so if the local school board
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
does not act on an
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional action of a
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent if not us then who is
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
there to protect the parents and
 
01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.870 align:start position:0%
there to protect the parents and
students

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%

01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative Mor I believe that a
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
local school district local school board
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
does have the authority and will make
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
the appropriate decisions based on their
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the matter and the
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
situation at hand I do believe that
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
items of free speech are adjudicated in
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
another branch of this government and in
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
fact May well be the
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%

sau67 the other being Bo of
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
course I'm here today to express my
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
confusion Regarding why anyone in the
 
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Legislature thinks
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
that they have any right to terminate a
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
lawfully executed contract between the
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
elected officials that comprise the seu
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
67 board and their administrative
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
leaders including our superintendent
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.149 align:start position:0%
leaders including our superintendent
Marcy

01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
Marcy
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
Kelly RSA 194c col 5 Roman 3 states
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
impertinent part that quote the school
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
administrative unit board shall have the
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
authority to remove superintendent and
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
other administrators end quote this law
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
does not state that the board's
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
Authority is subject to the legislature
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
under any circumstances simply put the
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has no Authority
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
here I think this bill attempts to
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
engage in an issue that is currently
 
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
before a judge and Federal Court
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
specifically in a manner that has no
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
meaningful impact on the process and
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
appears to only be meant to grab
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
headlines or otherwise try to whip up
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
some sort of political rhetoric for
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
benefit more so the wording of the be
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
Bill appears to lack any understanding
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
of the issues and nuances surrounding
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
the multiple incidents that occurred on
 
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
the sidelines of the bo High School
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
varsity girls soccer team games this
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
past fall we do not need to get into
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
those as this is not the court where
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
that issue is being decided which leads
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
me to wonder why anyone let alone a
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative from Wakefield thinks
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
that they can inject themselves into a
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
matter where they have no jurisdiction
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
in a town where they don't live and do
 
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
so in a manner that tries to preempt a
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
federal court ruling that hasn't been
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
made yet I think this bill is ridiculous
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
and I urge the committee to decline to
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
forward I would also add that
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent Kelly is a full support
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the Dumbarton School Board there is
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
much more to the job of superintendent
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
than having to deal with grandstanding
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who appear to be attempting
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
to get likes or otherwise trying to
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
motivate a specific group of people by
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
targeting a 14-year-old student our
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent does a great job in all
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
areas of her portfolio of
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and in the specific
 
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
issue this resolution is attempting to
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
highlight she was dealing with a
 
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
singular unprecedented and novel protest
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
apparently designed to create headlines
 
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
during that process she was working with
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
Council in a manner meant to abide by
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
all the laws regulations and policy IES
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
that are in effect from the federal
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
government the state of New Hampshire
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire inter Scholastic
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
Athletic Association sa67 in the B
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
school district superintendent Kelly
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
should be commended for her actions and
 
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
not subject to some clickbait resolution
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative McDonald thank
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for your
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
testimony I imagine um the
 
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent Marcy Kelly is aware of
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
this resolution has the dunard and
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
School Board spoken to her at all about
 
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
this is she aware of this yeah she's
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Woodcock thank you
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
m chair just a good morning s thank you
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
for coming down just a point of
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
clarification I I
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
um in respect to representativ vela's
 
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
putting this bill before us as ACR now
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
it's not often at all that I agree with
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative Bela
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
BR but I do think he has the right to do
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
that um and I would say in my last two
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
years of working with him here he
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
consistently brings bills that question
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
the Constitution how they interpret it
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm not suggesting this bill is good
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
I just I want to be clear that I don't I
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't think his motivation was for his
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
own personal gain that's
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
all may I respond to that or not he
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
asked you the question I would suggest
 
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
that since this is a federal court right
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
now being de decided as a civil issue
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
there really is no point to him trying
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
to presume a ruling that hasn't been
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
made yet which is what his bill does
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I would agree with that
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
but that that was my attempt but thank
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Cel thank you so much
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you and thank you so much for
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question I want to ask you the
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
same question I asked the representative
 
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
from the school boards Association do
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
you believe that the state legislature
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
has the right to overturn the decision
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
of an elected body within another
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
section of the state in my opinion and
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
from what the RSA that I read said no
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
they do not Mas quick followup yes
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so much and if the
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
voters in that District were unsatisfied
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
with the decision do they have recourse
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
yes they do have recourse of course
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's always elections for school
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
board officials and also if they are
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
unhappy with a school board decision
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
they can go to the State Board of
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
Education which is is how this works
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions

Damon this isn't actually a question I
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
just want to thank you and all of the
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
active engagement with public schools in

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
times thank you I appreciate that any

laraby

01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
my ears are burning a little bit since
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
I'm the both School Board Bryce larby
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
I've been the longtime chair of the the
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
school district and
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
um it's had a big impact on our on our
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
district and obviously Mrs Kelly as well
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here to speak on behalf of the
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
entire board um even though I'm I'm the
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
only one speaking on their behalf we are
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
in all are in agreement and we
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
strenuously object to this bill we
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
support M Kelly in all of her actions
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
and let me explain a little bit about
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
that the school board has really two
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
fundamental jobs it's creating budgeting
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
and finance and creating policies the
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
administration is the ones that
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
administer those policies it's our
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
policies that they administer and it's
 
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
at our direction that they do what they
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
do and we are still consistently happy
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
and pleased with what Miss Kelly has
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
done and she does our most fundamental
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
policy it's the protection of kids it's
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
the safety of kids and it doesn't matter
 
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
what the issue is our view is we're
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
there to protect those
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
children now September 17th is the the
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
date when this incident happened the
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
school knew a week beforehand that there
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
were people with plans to do something
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
disrupt that event in some way shape or
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
form targeted at an individual the
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
school looked into this those
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
individuals even reached out to the
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
school both meetings and emails the
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
school knew something was going to
 
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
happen and Miss Kelly took the action
 
01:19:07.149 --> 01:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
appropriately she perceived something
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
was going to happen that was going to
 
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
make a child
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and we put an end to that
 
01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
we don't know what could have happened
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
more if the school hadn't stepped in
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
maybe there are even even greater plans
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
we we don't know but this was a highly
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
unusual event I've coached over a
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
thousand games myself my estimate is
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
I've been to 4,000 on top of that my son
 
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
recently tried out for the Chicago Bears
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
like I know Sports and in those 5,000
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
games I've never once been seen a
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
protest and more importantly I've never
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
seen parents want to take the spotlight
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
away from their child who's
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
participating so this is an
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
unprecedented situation that M Kelly was
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
presented with and she acted accordingly
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
and it had nothing to do with
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
transgender rights if parents were there
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
to make fun of somebody because of their
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
last name or their hair color or their
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
shoes we expect the school to do the
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
same thing we expect them to step in and
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
not allow any sort of harassment to
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
children and even if that harassment
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen if they're perceiving
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
that something like that's going to
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
happen we expect them to step in and do
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
that and we applaud what Miss Kelly and
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%

superintendent this resolution
 
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
represents a significant overreach by
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
the state legislature imposing is a
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
serious threat to the foundational
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
principle of local control that is long
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%

systems New Hampshire has a rich
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
tradition of empowering local

communities to manage their schools hgr
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
6 undermines this tradition by allowing
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
political interference to replace the
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
thoughtful localized decision-making
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%

responsibility of locally elected school
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
boards who are directly accountable to
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
their constituents not dictated by
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
political pressures at the state
 
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.320 align:start position:0%

for every student and staff member
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
schools should be places where learning
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
and personal growth are prioritized free
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
from political agendas or
 
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
sensationalized media
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
narratives my role requires careful and
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes diff ult decision-making that
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
is grounded In fairness professionalism
 
01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
and the best interests of the entire
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
School Community while adhering to the

law public education must remain a safe
 
01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:09.639 align:start position:0%
stable and a political space where
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
students are given the tools to learn
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
and grow HCR 6 by seeking to remove me
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
for political reasons sets a dangerous
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
precedent that jeopardizes school
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
leadership and exposes it to the
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
shifting whims of politics rather than
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
focusing on the needs of students and

I urge you to reject HCR 6 and to
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
reaffirm New Hampshire's commitment to
 
01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
local control by doing so you'll help

violate these people's constitutional

to do with wearing black Iron bands

have a right to express their political
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
views in school and that right should
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
not be curtailed these were not students
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
expressing their political view these
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
were parents who were guests at a high

School sports game that is a limited
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
public forum it is not a street corner
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
where your first amendment
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of free speech are
 
01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
unregulated superintendent has the right
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
to regulate time space and Manner and if
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
they are going to restrict speech it has
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
to do on the element of
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
disruption if a child brings a
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
Confederate flag onto the school grounds
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
they may be suspended from school they
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
may not depending on the case for
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
disruption you bring that into a black
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
high school suspend from school because
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to call it disruption you
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
bring it into a white high school like
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
Bo was we'll probably have a
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
conversation with you about the relative
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
for disruption everything I saw about
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
this incident it was designed to be
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
disruptive Marcy was not only in her
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
rights to suspend those students from
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
school it was her responsibility to now
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
let's talk about nhiaa nhiaa controls
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
Sports in the state we have been looking
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
at this transgender issue for over a
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
decade it is complex it's not simple
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
yeah Connecticut the state holders in
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
the 100 yard Des are transgender females
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
unfair Advantage 120 lb soft more
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
playing on a soccer team you tell me
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
what the issue is there except for you
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
just don't like the fact that she's
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
transgender you tell
 
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
me all this other stuff goes away Marcy
 
01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
me all this other stuff goes away Marcy
was

01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
protecting a student who needed to be
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
protected one of the things about nhiaa
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
is you do not single a player out on the
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
other team
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
shooting a foul shot you shouldn't be
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
talking about that person's mother
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
saying their their name or anything it's
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
part of
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
sportsmanship these people were in the
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
stands they are guests of the school
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
district yes they're
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
parents but they don't have an unlimited
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
right to come in and do whatever they
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
want it's a limited public form and the
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
courts have traditionally recognized
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
that superintendent and school
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
administrators need that to go forward
 
01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I'll say actually two
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
last things one this body passed a that
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
said we're going to prevent bullying in
 
01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
schools that's what Marcy was doing
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
there was a power differential of adults
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
organized against a single student on
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
another team that's bullying and she
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
stood up and said no we're not going to
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
let that happen this body passed the law
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
and asked us to do this and final does
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
this body own
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
superintendence he used to the
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner education used to sign our
 
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%

students the rest of it comes up here no
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
no it goes to control it goes to who has

01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
know uh okay representative Cel and then
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman thank you so much
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question and
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
also for having served as a
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent and working with
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
nhiaa which I'm very familiar as a
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
parent of an athlete um I'm curious what
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
you were speaking at the end about who
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
has ultimate control over the
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent so if I'm unhappy with my
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
school superintendent could you tell me
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
from your perspective what's my recourse
 
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
about how to address that you go and
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
talk to your school board and I have had
 
01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
with a couple gentlemen that already
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
spoke here today some uncomfortable
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
conversations with them about my
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
behavior and what they did and what I
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
was representing and if you don't like
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
that you go and you vote your school
 
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
board out you get a new school board in
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
there and get you but it's a contract
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
between the local school board with
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
mostly local funds playing for it and
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
the person who works for them that's
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
what it is I mean I I don't see where
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
the state as a legislature has the right
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
to go and and mess with that
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
especially when you don't fund that much
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
thank representative Freeman
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I defer I I have my question
 
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
answered thank you any other
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your time thank
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
you so much it's always fun coming down
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
Osborne I think this was left on I'm
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
Adam osbor um I'm a principal in BO I'm
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
an administrator in BO and I promise to
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
be brief I'll try not to go back
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
overground that others have covered but
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
I do want to U touch on two points today
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
in the first I was going to talk a
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more at length around the
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
different levels of governance you know
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
local County State and then Federal um
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
because I think that's fundamentally why
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
this is a dangerous situation I think
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
that I recognize that people from out of
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
the bow in Dunbarton locality may be
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
displeased with the way things played
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
out the people with in within Bo D Bon
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
are pleased and I think that's because
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
it speaks to Marcy's character but
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's my second point I'll come back to
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
that in a moment I think the danger is
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer an illustration to
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
better kind of encapsulate this would be
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
what if it were the federal government
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
looking down on employees of the state
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
what if it were the federal government
 
01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:47.119 align:start position:0%
questioning who we had as a department
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
head or a commissioner of and you can
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
fill in the blank for which agency state
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
agency want I think we'd be IRA I think
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
the members around this table would be
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
irate because it wouldn't be within the
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
scope of their Authority it wouldn't be
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
within the lane that we generally
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
ascribe to that level of governance and
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
they should stay out of that but by the
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
same token I think the state should stay
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
out of this this is an issue of local
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
control and that's a Bedrock principle
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
of public schooling in New Hampshire we
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
value that and it's important the second
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
point I want to come to is is really the
 
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
question and I I think I'm uniquely
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
positioned kind of two talk to this
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
because Marcy's my boss I love working
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
for Marcy but the reason we're here
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
today is part of the reason I love
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
working for Marcy Mrs Kelly is a person
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
of conviction and character and the
 
01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
whole reason we're talking here today is
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
because she believes she was doing the
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
right thing standing up for kids as an
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
educational administrator as a person
 
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:48.280 align:start position:0%
who's worked in schools for 30
 
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
years that's a core value and if we're
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
ever going to air or not air
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
well air let it be on the side of
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
Defending kids as as Mr larby said if
 
01:32:01.709 --> 01:32:01.719 align:start position:0%
it's wrong then we don't want to be
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
right and and I agree with him so I I'll
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
stop my comments there but I think it's
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
an issue of local control staying within
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
our respective governance lanes and then
 
01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
I appreciate and applaud Mrs Kelly for
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
her conviction and character and
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
strength of character standing up for
 
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
children thank you any questions
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thanks Madam chair
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
question it's really a question for most
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
who have spoken would you comment about
 
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
the value to students
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
of the way this process was handled and
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
the respect for their
 
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
safety I think that that's a really good
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
question with a complex set of answers
 
01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear I am the Middle
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
School principal not the high school
 
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
principal so I was not Frontline to the
 
01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:55.719 align:start position:0%
varsity girls soccer game where this
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
occurred so all I can do is kind of
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
Imagine just as you would um but I think
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
our I have amazing respect for kids
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
period students are are brilliant smart
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
capable young people um and I think what
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
they witnessed that day was a thoughtful
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
response by Matt F the high school
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
principal Mike desit the High School
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
athletic director and also Mrs Kelly the
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent as they tried to
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
construct a safe and positive
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
environment for those two soccer teams
 
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
to come together and play they tried to
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
be clear with what the expectations were
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
prior to that game beyond that I don't
 
01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
think I'm really too qualified to speak
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
to the answer just because I wasn't
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
there and it's not my school building
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
but they were
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
thoughtful other
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
questions s oh representative Terry
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
um I I've been hearing folks who've been
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
testifying um speaking about the Primacy
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
the role in the Primacy of local control
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
mhm um and and I would like to just
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
refer to or or build off of a comment
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
made by representative Woodcock with
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
respect to our
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh of Representative belger
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
and the particular concerns that that he
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
has for the protection of constitutional
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
rights and and as I'm reading the the
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
resolution it appears to me that
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative beler is effectively
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with um the uh the local uh
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
school board with respect to certain
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
rights sir would it be your view then
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
that if the if if individuals were
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with the way in which the
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
local school board adjudicated
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
um this
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
situation that the appropriate recourse
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
would they have any recourse beyond the
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
local school board and if so and if it
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
might be the federal Judiciary or the
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
state Judiciary the judicial branch
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
would it be the Judiciary and not the
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
general court in your
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
view I'm I'm not a lawyer or a legal
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
expert but I think Mr Madden did a
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
really good job of kind of addressing
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
that um when he talked about it being in
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
a a court process already and I think it
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
would be premature for this body to
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
assume to supersede and step in over
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
what the school board has done so far
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
because I I think if I understand your
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
question correctly it's there's a legal
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
pending case already in
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
process oh so just to be 100% crystal
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
clear here that if if Folks at the local
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
level are dissatisfied with the way in
 
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.550 align:start position:0%
level are dissatisfied with the way in
which

01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
would be that that this has been handled
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
that their their appropriate recourse
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
would be the Judiciary where I
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
understand this this matter currently
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
lies I I think two things and I hope I'm
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
not misunderstanding your question um I
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
think if you're asking about local
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
citizens of bow and Dunbarton they would
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
go through the bow and dartan school
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
boards I think someone had referenced
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
the state's Board of Education beyond
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
that I think uh I was probably
 
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstood understanding your
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
question initially okay thank you any
 
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.709 align:start position:0%

before they even had a high school

you've heard I'm not going to reiterate

01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%

um and he's not wrong and what Marcy did
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
was what all superintendant what all
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
administrators and throughout all of our
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
schools is charged to do and that's to
 
01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
protect children whether they are
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
students in our district or they are
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
visiting for a sporting event we're
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
talking about a 14-year-old kid who was
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
there to play a soccer game um as a
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%

gone to our student body who had
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
prepared signage of some sort to gain
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of a a psychological advantage
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
over visiting team members and we have
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
taken them and we have escorted students
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
away from that contest because it's just
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
not okay it's just not okay to do that
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
to young people who are there to perform
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
to um participate in a sport that they
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
enjoy and should be free of any type of
 
01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
retaliation whether it be from students
 
01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:53.480 align:start position:0%

in front of you I hope that you would
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
consider killing this proposed
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%

minutes before um you opened the hearing

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
interference and uh support that we have

for uh Marcy um is that uh this doesn't
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note and it would require
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
the um School Board to spend money to
 
01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:00.280 align:start position:0%

01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
also remember that it's important to
 
01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
think about due process Clauses within
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
the Constitution under the fifth and the
 
01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.470 align:start position:0%
the Constitution under the fifth and the
14th

01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
14th
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment right now as we're sitting
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
back the fifth amendment guarantees that
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
no person shall be deprived of their
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
life liberty or property without the due
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
process of law currently uh
 
01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
superintendent Kelly is in a court case
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's unsettled it's a federal court
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
case it's undetermined and yet
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh who's moved this
 
01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
forward seems to feel it's appropriate
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
to publicly shame and humiliate Marcy
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
Kelly's Body of work and the decisions
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
that she's made when she has not been
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
proven guilty in the court of law in any
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
way shape or form secondly the 14th
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment extends the guarantee to the
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
states the Clause ensures individuals
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
are treated fairly by the justice system
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
not by the legislative body by the
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
justice system and lastly the sixth
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment guarantees the right to a fair
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
trial including the right to confront
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
Witnesses the right to a public trial
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
the right to impartial juries this
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
framework supports the idea the burden
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
of proof lies with the prosecution not
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
public sentiment so I ask you to think
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
very carefully about your balancing of
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
your equation when you want to look at
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
one Clause under the Constitution but
 
01:43:24.189 --> 01:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
willfully ignore many many others thank
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
you question representative mcdonell
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
being here you appear to know quite a
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
bit about constitutional law so my
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
question is kind of along those lines I
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
if this HCR were to pass since it is a
 
01:43:41.229 --> 01:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
resolution as opposed to a bill is there
 
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
some teeth to this is the school board
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
forced to comply with this so I'm going
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
to answer your question I am no more an
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
expert than you are because I'm I uh
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
graduated from a high school a public
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
school that taught civics and I'm
 
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
actually wonderfully uh glad for that
 
01:43:57.390 --> 01:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
experience to have that opportunity to
 
01:43:58.350 --> 01:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
know a little bit about what
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional law is all about that's
 
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
the limitation that I would turn that
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
over to lawyers who know better than I
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
but I will say this that as a resident
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
of Bo as a town of B when not if I
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
suspect that the board was um tasked by
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
the state to to move on this particular
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
action if that was to be the case I
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
would be happy to see a small increase
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
in my taxes which are already very high
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
for the funding of the lawsuit against
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
the state for the overreach on on their
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
ability to try to do what it is that
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
they think that they're able to do all
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative Cel thank
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
you so much and thank you for taking my
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
question I'm
 
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
curious if the state were to pass this
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um or this this resolution
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
sorry to be to make sure I'm being
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
precise with my language what do you
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
think do you think it would have a
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on the ability of school
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
boards to be able to hire
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
and continue to employ superintendents
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
in a state where we already have a
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
significant shortage of superintendent
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
candidates I think it's reasonable to
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
assume that there are boards who would
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
feel that way um many boards however
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
might feel just the opposite I think
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
that would have to be be the a function
 
01:45:11.589 --> 01:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
of the community and the board that
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
represents it um I will say this the
 
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
power and I've spoken to this many many
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
times the power of local control and the
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
ability to vote in elected members of
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
the represent representative communities
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
um is a powerful one it's not one that
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
we want to throw away it's not one that
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
we want to ignore the job of a
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent is not it is not you'll
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
hear me say it it is absolutely not to
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
determine what the what the issues of
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
the community um are under the law in
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
terms of how and and why politically we
 
01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
perceive them we act on the on the on
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
the board when the board drives us we
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
advise them we support them we follow
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
the laws that we can but we work with
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
our Council we work with our board to
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
enact what it is that we're charging to
 
01:45:55.470 --> 01:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
do to make sure that we that we
 
01:45:57.589 --> 01:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
administer the policies of the school
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
district and that's all Marcy did she
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
worked within the boundaries of her role
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
follow up if you can do it quickly thank
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
you so much for allowing me a followup
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
and if as we're in your role as an
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent if you believe
 
01:46:10.109 --> 01:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
your school board directed you to do
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
something that you believed was illegal
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
would you have recourse absolutely we
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
would um any superintendent who had
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
questioned about what they were doing um
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
was illegal under the law would first of
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
all they would represent through Legal C
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
Council whatever that perspective is um
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
they would bring legal counsel to bear
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
on the board the board would hear those
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
conversations in non-public setting they
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
would have maybe public setting they
 
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
would have those conversations and then
 
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
they would have the opportunity to
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
direct the superintendent to take action
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
in accordance with what they believe was
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
the appropriate action thank you so any
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none I'm going to
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%

introduce House Bill 208 with a fiscal
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
note um what
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
208 the the way 208 was born uh it it
 
01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
was a you know before Bill submission I
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
try to make a habit of going to a school
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
board meeting and asking them what I
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
could do to help them and uh the school
 
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
board uh in a public hearing asked me to
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
do support four bills uh I negotiated it
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
down to three um the other one wanted a
 
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
bunch of money
 
01:54:15.629 --> 01:54:15.639 align:start position:0%
retroactively um uh but this one seemed
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
to be reasonable they are having trouble
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
hiring School nurses under the existing
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
law um and the principal um Lori Collins
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
um thought that um if if we could take
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
another look at the requirements for the
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
position it may be possible to uh make
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
it a little more flexible for hiring to
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
take place without violating the
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
critical need to maintain quality of
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
care and so uh listening to her I
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
drafted something up and then I talked
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
to my good friend over in the school
 
01:54:57.069 --> 01:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
nurse Association I I I think you might
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
hear from them and uh I believe we've
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
found a mutual mutually accommodative
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
position where we can make the law a
 
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more flexible and and keep it
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
within the Professional Standards of our
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
School nurses so if you look at line two
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
it basically says uh it adds that um in
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
their in their uhr current experience
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
that they could have acute or chronic
 
01:55:25.599 --> 01:55:26.510 align:start position:0%
that they could have acute or chronic
care

01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:55:29.310 --> 01:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
experience uh it changes the requirement
 
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
around pediatric nursing into showing a
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
a priority within pediatric settings um
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
it uh creates an
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
Andor um around the uh skill sets so
 
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
that people of varying backgrounds might
 
01:55:52.030 --> 01:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
become eligible for consideration uh of
 
01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
course the hiring you'd still want to
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
hire the best available but if you can't
 
01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
hire anyone you have no quality you have
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
no school nurse and and that's what um
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh at least the Auburn Village School
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
was confronting is they they don't have
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
one because they can't hire one and so
 
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
um so the other online um seven is is
 
01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
another tweak to to talk about aptitude
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
in other words you know if we if we find
 
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
a u a less experience I.E maybe younger
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
um nurse that um has great potential and
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
a great passion for this line that uh
 
01:56:35.470 --> 01:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
they they they ought to have an
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to compete and and hopefully
 
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
have a merit-based system to reward the
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
the best qualified so so that's what
 
01:56:48.189 --> 01:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
hp28 does it's why I'm introducing it
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions any
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions restive
 
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:56:57.149 --> 01:56:57.159 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing forward
 
01:56:58.510 --> 01:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
um this from what I understand you're
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
saying this would allow districts to
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
have more flexibility around hiring I.E
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
experience and starting pay is that
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
correct I I I had a hard time hearing
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
whether you said inexperienced or
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
experienced thank you representative I
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say inexperience I'd say
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
experience so this would allow the
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
districts to have more flexibility
 
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
around experience and or starting pay is
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
that correct I I I'm trying to be too
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
precise I think I I think what the
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility does is it uh trades off
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
some of the harder uh positions around
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
stated experience to uh to allow for
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
aptitude and potential uh so so in that
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
way in that regard I think it's meant to
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
be more flexible thank you
 
01:57:55.629 --> 01:57:55.639 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you thank
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question are they
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
having a hard time hiring people because
 
01:58:02.069 --> 01:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
of these reasons or because School
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
nurses now have to be certified by the
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and have two
 
01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
certifications one nursing and one with
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
the Board of Education I I had really
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
asked I pleaded actually uh with the
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
principal to show up and explain the
 
01:58:19.629 --> 01:58:19.639 align:start position:0%
problems she's had with the hiring
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
system I I know that in the public
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
comments during the school board uh she
 
01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
she went into length about how um um she
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
she would present someone that she
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
thought was a good applicant and had
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
trouble at the board of education level
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
getting sort of their approval now I
 
01:58:46.109 --> 01:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
have to disclaim all of this I I I this
 
01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
is not my subject matter uh she told me
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
this in a meeting in August or something
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
I've had a lot of fun since then so I
 
01:58:58.830 --> 01:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what she said to me
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
but I think her comment was that it the
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
the challenge was getting an applicant
 
01:59:07.629 --> 01:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
past the Board of
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
Education uh criteria thank you and I I
 
01:59:15.149 --> 01:59:15.159 align:start position:0%
showed her this language there's follow
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
up on that I've showed her this language
 
01:59:19.709 --> 01:59:19.719 align:start position:0%
and she thinks this language would help
 
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
question it's not entirely clear to me
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you can help me better
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
understand this although it may be more
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
for the nursing
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
people um in line two and line three I
 
01:59:40.830 --> 01:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
don't really see the proposed new
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
language as changing the
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
qualifications because the original
 
01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
language says current experience in
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
pediatric nursing or other related
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
nursing areas so how is changing it to a
 
01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
priority in pediatric settings
 
01:59:59.470 --> 01:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
it I I just don't see how it changes
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
anything um I uh I drafted this in in
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
August submitted it to a few reviews um
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
I this this ended up kind of in my my
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
voice probably and uh I I just wanted to
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
clarify that uh regardless of the other
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
related nursing areas there was still a
 
02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
priority on Pediatric we weren't dumping
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
pediatric we were just putting it in the
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
context of it's it being a priority not
 
02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
a a requirement that we keep someone
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
from being
 
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
compliant I appreciate the intent okay
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative Woodcock thank
 
02:00:45.189 --> 02:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the fact you're bringing
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
something to help this I just want to
 
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
Clarity on your response to
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell when you were
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
talking just said the Board of Education
 
02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:57.159 align:start position:0%
criteria were you talking about the
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
local school board or the Department of
 
02:01:03.069 --> 02:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
Education license shff criteria I I
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
think I meant to be referring to the
 
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education criteria yeah
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
they the the school okay was happy with
 
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
the applicant and was not allowed to
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
proceed with hiring I think may follow
 
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um just two quick
 
02:01:19.870 --> 02:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
other ones I heard you refer to the scho
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
school Nurses Association is there SP
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
person here okay I want to ask you that
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
one um finally one thank you um short
 
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
how thank you how you determine what do
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
you mean by acute acute care AC acute
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
care it's a it it's a word in healthc
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
care acute is kind of an emergent injury
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
based sort of care like like if uh acute
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
care might be kid running down the hall
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
and slamming their face into the door
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
they would have an acute care situation
 
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
something that needed to be taken care
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
of at the moment uh and that's uh uh ju
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
opposed against chronic which is just
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
like longterm if the kid has early onset
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
diabetes or something that would be a
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
chronic care situation I only I only
 
02:02:10.069 --> 02:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
asked they terms of art y I only asked
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
that because I was referring to
 
02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
represent Damon's comment about it's
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
similar to nursing their nurse so they
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
have they they have skills uh that deal
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
with that that's all they just think
 
02:02:23.229 --> 02:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
some I didn't know if there SE I got it
 
02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bon thank you
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious online uh nine
 
02:02:34.069 --> 02:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
um it says providing leadership and it
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
did say in the profession and
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
professional nursing practice why why
 
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
are you striking out
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
profession um because it's just a
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
cleaner sentence and it make it doesn't
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
make it sound like there are additive
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
requirements when it's really just one
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
requirement to be able to Dem
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.109 --> 02:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
Simplicity any other questions seeing
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you and
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you madam chair members of
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
the committee nice to be with you all
 
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
today my name is Sean Thomas I'm with
 
02:03:27.709 --> 02:03:27.719 align:start position:0%
the m preol and Thomas here in conquer
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
and we have the privilege of
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire school
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association um so I'm pin hitting
 
02:03:36.669 --> 02:03:36.679 align:start position:0%
today we had a wonderful school nurse
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
lined up to testify but unfortunately
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
she couldn't make it at the last minute
 
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
so this will be brief and I'll do my
 
02:03:44.189 --> 02:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
best to answer any questions but um
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
really just want you to know that we had
 
02:03:48.750 --> 02:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
talked to representative Edwards very
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
early on during the LSR process um
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
this bill these are his ideas obviously
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
based on conversations he had with the
 
02:03:58.990 --> 02:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
Auburn Village School and his ideas but
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
we very much support it as an
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
improvement to what is a very important
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh certification because and we support
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
it because it recognizes I think the
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
current Nur nursing shortage and the the
 
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:12.679 align:start position:0%
need for more flexibility so that's how
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
we view it we support it we think it's a
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
good thing and to the extent there are
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll do my best to try to
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
answer them any questions Mr Thomas uh
 
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative Damon then Mr Woodcock
 
02:04:25.549 --> 02:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question nice to see you you
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
as well are you aware from The Nurses
 
02:04:30.599 --> 02:04:32.430 align:start position:0%
as well are you aware from The Nurses
Association

02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
of other additional approaches that they
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
might like to address this shortage of
 
02:04:41.229 --> 02:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
adequate School
 
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
nursing yeah so I mean that's an
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
interesting question so this is this is
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
an issue I'm sure many of you are
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with we've seen it now over the
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
last several years I think there's been
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
tweaks if not every year maybe every
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
maybe every second year um and I think
 
02:04:58.510 --> 02:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's just the reality of the sort of
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
the nursing shortage and and things that
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
have transpired since co uh especially
 
02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important the history
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
is important with respect to the
 
02:05:10.589 --> 02:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
certification program it's relatively
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
new I mean so it starts back in
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
2016 it was actually a collaboration
 
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education at that
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
time in response to complaints and
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding the quality of stool
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
of School nurses so that's sort of the
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
impetus that's why we have the
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
certification program now and I think it
 
02:05:31.069 --> 02:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
serves it serves an important function
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
like representative Edwards said uh
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
there is a critical need for high
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
quality health care and that's really
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
what this establishes I mean if you
 
02:05:40.109 --> 02:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
think about School nurses in a sense it
 
02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
really is a
 
02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:42.870 align:start position:0%
really is a
specialty

02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
specialty
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
um they may be in most in most cases
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the one Medical
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
Professional in the building they need
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
to respond to a number of issues uh make
 
02:05:53.709 --> 02:05:53.719 align:start position:0%
quick informed decisions particularly
 
02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
emergency situations and these are
 
02:05:59.310 --> 02:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
things where really maintaining that
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
high standard is important and that's
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
really why we think the certification
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
program is important um and so to the
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
extent there are little little things we
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
can do to improve the to expand
 
02:06:13.069 --> 02:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
flexibility or increase flexibility
 
02:06:14.669 --> 02:06:14.679 align:start position:0%
while still maintaining that standard we
 
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
think that's a good thing and that's why
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
we support this bill and I think but in
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
terms of specific ideas Beyond this I
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
haven't heard any unfortunately but I
 
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
mean we're always open to ideas thank
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Woodcock thank you m
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so much turn thaning my
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
question I just want to be clear on what
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
you just said to representative Damon
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so is your position or the position
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the nurs the position of the Nurses
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
Association is that they are supporting
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
the doe certification requirement that's
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
correct yes very much so okay thank you
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you m chair representative
 
02:06:51.629 --> 02:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I'm still
 
02:06:55.870 --> 02:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
struggling a little bit with the
 
02:06:59.790 --> 02:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
language on um lines 2 and three because
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear to really change it
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
that significantly can you speak to how
 
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
that actually changes
 
02:07:10.109 --> 02:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
it yeah so I think the concern among
 
02:07:14.109 --> 02:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
some who um who apply for these
 
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
positions is they may have significant
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
experience in acute or chronic care
 
02:07:21.149 --> 02:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
settings not necessarily in pediatric
 
02:07:21.159 --> 02:07:22.390 align:start position:0%
settings not necessarily in pediatric
settings

02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
settings
 
02:07:24.549 --> 02:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
and they are kept out of applying or
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
becoming School nurses and so the idea
 
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
here is rather than Focus specifically
 
02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
on on experience in pediatric settings
 
02:07:36.189 --> 02:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
you would allow hiring folks who have
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
more acute acute and chronic care um
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
experience and that translates equally
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
well into the school setting as well
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
because at the school you're dealing
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
with those types of
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
issues followup um so so primarily
 
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the wording and
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
having acute and chronic care first will
 
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
help them in advertising the positions
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
to attract more
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
candidates uh I think it expands the
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
pool of available
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
applicants so you rather than saying
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
you're only eligible to apply to the
 
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
extent you have pediatric experience
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
this would if to the extent you didn't
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
have pediatric experience specifically
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
but had acute chronic ha experience you
 
02:08:24.510 --> 02:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
could also apply where where maybe now
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't or you wouldn't be able to
 
02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:27.350 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't or you wouldn't be able to
be

02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
hired representative Hall thank you
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
question sorry um so the word priority I
 
02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking it actually says they
 
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
have to have experience in a pediatric
 
02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:43.559 align:start position:0%
setting because it's a priority how is
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
priority measured is that just like more
 
02:08:47.790 --> 02:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
than anything else is that over 50% of
 
02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:48.709 align:start position:0%
than anything else is that over 50% of
their

02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
time you know what I mean it looks to me
 
02:08:53.950 --> 02:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
like they have to have the Pediatric
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
experience yeah I mean that that may be
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
a a better question for representative
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
Edwards but I I guess when I when when
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
we looked at this and when I read this I
 
02:09:05.549 --> 02:09:05.559 align:start position:0%
think it's sort of referenc in an ideal
 
02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
situation where still there is some
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
pediatric experience um but I think the
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
change here is that acute or chronic
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
care experience is really what is
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
important pediatric would be would be a
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
nice plus but wouldn't be necessary I
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
think that's sort of how we read that
 
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
change can I have second question follow
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
up go ahead okay follow up second
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
question um The Lure versus
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
certification am I correct that
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
certification with the doe is every 3
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
years lure is every two years is that
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
right or did I read that uh lure is
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
every two years and I believe yes
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
certification is every three
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
years thank you representative Cornell
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
so do you think it's gotten more
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for districts to hire School
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
nurses when now that they have to be
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
certified by the Department of Education
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
and hold a license in nursing they have
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
two licenses um which is more difficult
 
02:10:11.790 --> 02:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
to get I I know that in Manchester
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage of School nurses um
 
02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
and I think they're having a hard time
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
finding them because of the
 
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
certification and lure yeah I mean
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's a fair question and I I
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
will say I I think the given the current
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances the nursing shortage
 
02:10:30.669 --> 02:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
issues I think that's contributing to
 
02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
some of these issues I don't think it's
 
02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
the certification specifically again
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
this goes back to
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
2016 there hasn't been a problem except
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the last probably several years and
 
02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
my understanding is there are very
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's relatively few openings in
 
02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:48.559 align:start position:0%
school nursing outside of the two big
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
cities Manchester and NASA and even in
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
those cases
 
02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
I believe they're using agency nurses I
 
02:10:55.709 --> 02:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
think that's really the issue in
 
02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashville that's my
 
02:10:57.159 --> 02:10:58.390 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashville that's my
understanding

02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:11:00.669 --> 02:11:00.679 align:start position:0%
anyways they aren't allowed to use
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
agency well agency nurses aren't allowed
 
02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
to leave the agency to be hired by the
 
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
school district so that's causing a big
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
problem too but I don't think it's just
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and Nashville I I think
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
it's Statewide the the so what from what
 
02:11:18.189 --> 02:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
I've been told it's it's it's a a
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
handful or less than a handful outside
 
02:11:23.549 --> 02:11:23.559 align:start position:0%
of Manchester asell representative C
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you for
 
02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question and if you don't know
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
the answer to this and want to respond
 
02:11:31.629 --> 02:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
later okay um would this allow someone
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
who let's say graduated from nursing
 
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
school in December but did a like a I
 
02:11:37.549 --> 02:11:37.559 align:start position:0%
don't know if they do internships and
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
nursing programs the way they do in
 
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
rotations thank you the way they do in
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
education programs would that person
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
then be based on this bill eligible to
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
be hired this week as a school nurse
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's a good question I
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually don't know specifically um doe
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
may know the answer to that question if
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
if they intend to testify I'm not sure
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
but I but this particular
 
02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think changes the answer to
 
02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:07.549 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think changes the answer to
that

02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:07.559 --> 02:12:09.950 align:start position:0%
that
question

02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
um again it's it's changing sort of the
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
experience requirement I don't know that
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
it changes with respect to new grad and
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
how and how all that intermingles I
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a change there but
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
again I I don't know for sure I'm sorry
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank we do have the opportunity to have
 
02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
Steve applebe come up and ask her
 
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
technical questions do you have a
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
question for this gentleman okay
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you so I
 
02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
think I'm understanding from the
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
discussion that line 23 in the proposed
 
02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
language is saying that a person who has
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
three years of experience in either
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
acute or chronic
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
care not necessarily any Pediatric Care
 
02:12:59.470 --> 02:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
could be hired for a school nurse
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
position however if there were other
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
candidates who had pediatric care
 
02:13:04.990 --> 02:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
experience they would be given priority
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
is is that basically what it's saying
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is nodding his
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
head to me then then that must be what
 
02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.950 align:start position:0%
head to me then then that must be what
it's

02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
saying no I no I I I agree I mean I I
 
02:13:20.549 --> 02:13:20.559 align:start position:0%
think that would be a decision um the
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
administrator could make but I think
 
02:13:24.669 --> 02:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
this this particular language affords
 
02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
them that
 
02:13:28.990 --> 02:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility any other questions Sone
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much do we want to call
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
Steve applebe up thank you for any
 
02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:34.069 align:start position:0%
Steve applebe up thank you for any
technical

02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
technical
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
up all right good afternoon chair hi
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
Representatives Steven app Auburn New
 
02:13:46.549 --> 02:13:46.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Department of Education
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
educator support and higher education so
 
02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:51.559 align:start position:0%
I Heard lots of questions
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
fire away questions for Mr Apple uh
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell we'll kind of go
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
this way okay thank you for coming Steve
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
um are our teach are nurses finding it
 
02:14:07.149 --> 02:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
difficult to get the certificate from Li
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
certificate from the Department of
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
Education um to go along with a night
 
02:14:14.549 --> 02:14:14.559 align:start position:0%
license n yes thank you for the question
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
I would say based on the current
 
02:14:20.669 --> 02:14:20.679 align:start position:0%
statutory language it is restrictive and
 
02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
very often I have conversations with
 
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
superintendents around the Restriction
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
that the statutory language um States so
 
02:14:32.350 --> 02:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
um for example um the the proposed
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
removes pediatric nursing or other
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
related nursing areas that wording what
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
that means is we see applicants at times
 
02:14:44.549 --> 02:14:44.559 align:start position:0%
whove worked in for worked for example
 
02:14:46.589 --> 02:14:46.599 align:start position:0%
in retirin
 
02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:50.559 align:start position:0%
home we can't say that's related we just
 
02:14:52.510 --> 02:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
can't get there if they're working in a
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
retirement home as a nurse and they
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
apply for a license because now they
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
want to work in a school the current
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
statutory language says related area we
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
don't interpret working in a retirement
 
02:15:06.510 --> 02:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
home as a related area so I would say
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
the stat current statutory language is
 
02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
restrictive okay representative
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
Bon uh thank you for taking my question
 
02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
um last year if I recall we made some
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
changes into those certification
 
02:15:19.599 --> 02:15:21.149 align:start position:0%
changes into those certification
requirements

02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
um has that helped at all uh thank thank
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I would say on
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
balance no it hasn't made any difference
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative cig thank you I'm
 
02:15:35.709 --> 02:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
sure you heard my question about the
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
newly graduated nurses um I just
 
02:15:40.910 --> 02:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
wondered yes relates please yeah thank
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
you um the requirement is that they have
 
02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
three years of
 
02:15:49.709 --> 02:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
experience so if may I follow up sorry
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
if if that is as a a a student rotation
 
02:15:56.549 --> 02:15:56.559 align:start position:0%
would that be considered sufficient
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
experience so we um I would have to seek
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
check with our legal counsel but on the
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
face of it that would sound like that
 
02:16:08.350 --> 02:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
was experience gained before they held
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
their nurse their Registered Nursing
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
license and typically typically we don't
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
count experience in a role in fact we
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
have administrative
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
rule um to this fact that if you're in a
 
02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
role that requires a license and you
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
don't possess that license we don't
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
count that experience towards that
 
02:16:29.709 --> 02:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
license now in this instance whether or
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
not that would apply I'd have
 
02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
to se advice representative Freeman
 
02:16:36.589 --> 02:16:36.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Mr
 
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
Appleby for coming in front of us I'm
 
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
sure we're going to have a wonderful
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
relationship in this legislative term um
 
02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
I do have a question um for you about
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
some of the changes that I saw when I
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
was in the legislature six years ago and
 
02:16:51.629 --> 02:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
one of them was about um the educational
 
02:16:55.309 --> 02:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
requirements of School nurses it was
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
associates degree but then associate
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
degree nurses were grandfathered in as
 
02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
of 2022 that as long as they had an
 
02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
associate degree and when enrolled in a
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
Bachelor of Science um degree in nursing
 
02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
they could be and completed that program
 
02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
within six years then they could be a
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
school nurse um are you finding that
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
that particular administrative rule is
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
prohibitive for districts for hiring
 
02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:23.190 align:start position:0%
prohibitive for districts for hiring
nurses

02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I would
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
say unbalance no I think that's
 
02:17:29.469 --> 02:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
actually less
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
restrictive having that language so you
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any push back I'm sorry
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
followup I apologize Madam chair I have
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
my hand up all the time and you don't
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
see me so I'm just yeah yeah so you
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't see any push back from that
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
particular administrative role change
 
02:17:46.509 --> 02:17:46.519 align:start position:0%
the only push back that I've witnessed
 
02:17:48.190 --> 02:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
with regard to that change are
 
02:17:50.190 --> 02:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who can't complete the
 
02:17:52.589 --> 02:17:52.599 align:start position:0%
requirement that in the out of time okay
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
so they have an associates they get to
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
the end of that time period three or six
 
02:17:59.910 --> 02:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
years and then they can't move forward
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
because they didn't get that bachelor's
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
degree very good thank you so much
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you madam
 
02:18:07.469 --> 02:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
question so the example you gave about
 
02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
the nursing home so the nurse comes in
 
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
and wants certification but if she's
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
been in a she or he have been in a a
 
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home then the language here was
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
says with a priority within Pediatric
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
settings this language wouldn't change
 
02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
that at all right because they haven't
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
been in a ped pediatric setting um is
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
that right yeah thank you for the
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
question well it says a priority within
 
02:18:33.629 --> 02:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say experience in right so I
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
would I would again seek legal advice
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
but my just back of the envelope look at
 
02:18:40.509 --> 02:18:40.519 align:start position:0%
it would be this is less restrictive
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
than the current statutory language
 
02:18:43.629 --> 02:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
follow up with you just the word
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
priority how do you see the word
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
priority in this language I mean it's
 
02:18:49.629 --> 02:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
you have to have done it I'm not thank
 
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question I know you didn't
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
not an attorney but we would look at
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
that and say okay well if they have it
 
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
great priority it doesn't say they have
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
to have it we view that is less than a
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
must or
 
02:19:04.509 --> 02:19:04.519 align:start position:0%
shall again I could be wrong I'm not an
 
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
attorney question representative
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you once again for being here
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
and helping the committee uh I'd like to
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
go back to your comment that you just
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
made to representative
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
Hall the priority piece
 
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
so if they don't have it they do have it
 
02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
I I was trying to figure out it's the
 
02:19:26.349 --> 02:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
local priority in hiring or you as a
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
certification but I I was getting a
 
02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
different gist when I heard you speak
 
02:19:32.429 --> 02:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
basically you're saying that verbiage in
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
priority doesn't mean anything because
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's just not necessarily reason
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter either happy or don't it
 
02:19:40.509 --> 02:19:40.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter it's just a priority for
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
someone is that bear thank you I think
 
02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
in in regards to lure for School nurses
 
02:19:46.709 --> 02:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Education and
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education the word
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
priority is not shall right so it
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't have I would seek legal
 
02:19:56.110 --> 02:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
counsel on our end but okay thank you so
 
02:19:58.750 --> 02:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you m chair any other
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%

02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
much and I'm going to close the hearing

welcome back everybody um uh we're ready
 
03:04:13.309 --> 03:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
for our one hearing this afternoon with
 
03:04:15.229 --> 03:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
it which is House Bill
 
03:04:18.309 --> 03:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
68 uh making best interest placements
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
within the same school district
 
03:04:21.870 --> 03:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
mandatory in the absence of a valid
 
03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
reason to deny the placement and uh the
 
03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Lon is here
 
03:04:35.950 --> 03:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.349 --> 03:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
knows thank you Mr chairman for the
 
03:04:40.590 --> 03:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
record I am Erica Leon representing the
 
03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
town of Derry which is Rockingham 13 I'm
 
03:04:45.550 --> 03:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
a third term rep and I got to spend my
 
03:04:48.030 --> 03:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
first year with uh many people here on
 
03:04:50.830 --> 03:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
education my bill is actually quite
 
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
simple it says that if a parent believes
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
that their student would do better in a
 
03:04:58.710 --> 03:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
different School in the same district
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes unless there's a
 
03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
really good reason to say no I think one
 
03:05:05.070 --> 03:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
good reason to say no is if there's not
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
enough space in the classroom and quite
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
frankly if them moving in would mean
 
03:05:11.830 --> 03:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
that there's not an open one open seat
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
for a kid who moves into that school's
 
03:05:16.910 --> 03:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
territory during the school year that
 
03:05:19.469 --> 03:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
would be a valid reason to say no right
 
03:05:21.630 --> 03:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
now we do have best interest placement
 
03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
which allows a parent to ask the
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent to move their student to
 
03:05:28.110 --> 03:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
a different School within the district
 
03:05:30.030 --> 03:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
or to one of the other options within
 
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
their school district in Dairy we don't
 
03:05:35.790 --> 03:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
do any uh tuition or any out of District
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
placements for for sard students unless
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
it has to do with special education so
 
03:05:41.910 --> 03:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's not relevant to my district
 
03:05:43.750 --> 03:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
however best interest placement itself
 
03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
does impact that in other areas but this
 
03:05:49.150 --> 03:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't touch that it only talks
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
about the in District changes so we had
 
03:05:54.750 --> 03:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
a situation in Dairy we had five
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
elementary schools we now have four and
 
03:06:00.030 --> 03:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
the students from dairy Village School
 
03:06:01.950 --> 03:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
were moved around to different schools
 
03:06:04.750 --> 03:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
within the town the fourth graders that
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
were being moved were were in their last
 
03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
year of Elementary these were the kids
 
03:06:11.269 --> 03:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
who came in with virtual kindergarten
 
03:06:13.030 --> 03:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
they were Mass through first grade and
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
half a second grade in third grade they
 
03:06:17.150 --> 03:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
found out that their Beloved School that
 
03:06:18.830 --> 03:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps their parents that attended as
 
03:06:21.389 --> 03:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
well was closing and then they moved to
 
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
another school if there's not a good
 
03:06:26.590 --> 03:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
time and a good reason to say yes to
 
03:06:28.229 --> 03:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
most of the parents who are asking to
 
03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
move their child to a different school I
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what it would be you had
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
students who wanted to follow a mass
 
03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
specialist that they had finally come
 
03:06:38.670 --> 03:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
out of their shell and were finally
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
doing a good job they want they had been
 
03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
at the both been assigned to the same
 
03:06:44.349 --> 03:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
school but they wanted they then with
 
03:06:46.229 --> 03:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
the redistricting they were moved to
 
03:06:48.190 --> 03:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
different schools when you have a
 
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
student who's shy and has a hard time in
 
03:06:52.429 --> 03:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
school but has finally just started to
 
03:06:54.670 --> 03:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
flourish I think it would be a simple
 
03:06:56.309 --> 03:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
move to say that they can follow that
 
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
teacher who they have a really good
 
03:07:01.150 --> 03:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with that request was made
 
03:07:02.229 --> 03:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
denied there were other requests as well
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
I actually brought this up at tryouts
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
for little leag um there's a whole
 
03:07:11.229 --> 03:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
broadc cross section of parents and I
 
03:07:13.150 --> 03:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
was shocked at the number of parents who
 
03:07:15.269 --> 03:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
had asked to have their child moved and
 
03:07:17.150 --> 03:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
they were rejected by the superintendent
 
03:07:18.990 --> 03:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
without without any explanation or
 
03:07:20.830 --> 03:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
reason because that's what the current
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
law says it expects a lot of compassion
 
03:07:26.670 --> 03:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
on the part of the superintendance and I
 
03:07:28.469 --> 03:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
get that they have a hard job I get that
 
03:07:31.150 --> 03:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot for them to do but
 
03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
accommodating our students should be
 
03:07:35.710 --> 03:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
pretty simple that is why I filed this
 
03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
bill the other issue too is that right
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
now when the superintendent doesn't
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
follow the law about what to do for best
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
interest placement it just drags on and
 
03:07:49.190 --> 03:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
on and on the 10day require M to have a
 
03:07:51.870 --> 03:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
hearing did not happen for many of these
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
students but there were no
 
03:07:56.590 --> 03:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
repercussions this law would also say
 
03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
that if the superintendent doesn't
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
respond and doesn't follow the law then
 
03:08:02.110 --> 03:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
the request is granted I think that's
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
the least that we can do and it doesn't
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
go to penalties or punishments for the
 
03:08:08.190 --> 03:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent it just makes that mostly
 
03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
yes a definite
 
03:08:13.550 --> 03:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
yes so this has no Financial impact
 
03:08:15.389 --> 03:08:15.399 align:start position:0%
because these are schools within the
 
03:08:18.389 --> 03:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
same district within that should under
 
03:08:21.269 --> 03:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
RSA 1891 should be providing the same
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
level of Education same opportunity for
 
03:08:25.630 --> 03:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
education at all schools within the
 
03:08:28.070 --> 03:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
district I don't expect that this will
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
be because one school is good or one
 
03:08:32.229 --> 03:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
school is bad I expect that a lot of
 
03:08:34.349 --> 03:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
this will be about learning styles or
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
getting away from a
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
bully there's many reasons why a student
 
03:08:41.110 --> 03:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
may do better at a different school
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
right now their main option is to either
 
03:08:45.269 --> 03:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
apply to a charter school or leave the
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
public school system this gives them a
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes to move to a different School in
 
03:08:52.510 --> 03:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
District staying in with with their
 
03:08:54.510 --> 03:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
District staying with kids in their
 
03:08:56.349 --> 03:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
community and getting to know more that
 
03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
they'll see in middle school and high
 
03:09:01.389 --> 03:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
school I think that this is the smallest
 
03:09:03.630 --> 03:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
possible step to give more options to
 
03:09:05.630 --> 03:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
our parents and students and I hope that
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
you will support
 
03:09:10.389 --> 03:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much representative uh
 
03:09:12.429 --> 03:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
Damon excuse me thank you Mr chair thank
 
03:09:19.750 --> 03:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
03:09:22.670 --> 03:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
question does this
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
change student access to approved
 
03:09:29.110 --> 03:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
private schools in District No thank you
 
03:09:31.030 --> 03:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
for the question this does not impact
 
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
this this is only for IND district
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
schools the IND District public schools
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
and if there's something that we could
 
03:09:38.429 --> 03:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
do to tighten it and make it clear that
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
it is only for the public schools and
 
03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
not a private school that was my
 
03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
intention when I asked for this language
 
03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:45.630 align:start position:0%
intention when I asked for this language
for

03:09:45.630 --> 03:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:09:48.229 --> 03:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
OS yes
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
on line five and line seven it says
 
03:09:53.630 --> 03:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
approved private
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
school so that's clearly not only Public
 
03:10:01.070 --> 03:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
Schools I think that's a question oh
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you I think you've had the same
 
03:10:04.710 --> 03:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
experience of OLS not drafting things
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
exactly how you intended um I apologize
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
that I have put a number of bills in and
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
you're correct so we should strike that
 
03:10:13.229 --> 03:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
a pro private school and it should only
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
be made to another public school or
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
public Academy I apologize for that
 
03:10:19.950 --> 03:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
oversight and I thank you for catching
 
03:10:22.590 --> 03:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
that further questions representative
 
03:10:24.790 --> 03:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
SEL thank you and thank you for taking
 
03:10:27.510 --> 03:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
my question so clearly in der you have
 
03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
as you said now Four elementary schools
 
03:10:30.429 --> 03:10:30.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how many middle schools
 
03:10:33.750 --> 03:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
and high schools in your District um
 
03:10:35.790 --> 03:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
outside of the so we have dairy we've
 
03:10:37.910 --> 03:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
got Dober you know some of the cities in
 
03:10:41.389 --> 03:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
the state um many of our small towns my
 
03:10:43.790 --> 03:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is only have one school in
 
03:10:46.429 --> 03:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
their District so how what would the
 
03:10:48.190 --> 03:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
impact be on
 
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
a a district that has literally one
 
03:10:52.670 --> 03:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
elementary school and maybe not even a
 
03:10:54.670 --> 03:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
middle or High School within their
 
03:10:56.670 --> 03:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
community that they they tuition to well
 
03:10:58.030 --> 03:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
thank you there would be absolutely no
 
03:11:00.150 --> 03:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
impact on them because you can't move to
 
03:11:01.790 --> 03:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
another IND District school if there was
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
only one IND District school and in
 
03:11:05.229 --> 03:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
Dairy it would only apply to elementary
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
school because along with Closing one of
 
03:11:10.590 --> 03:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
our five elementary schools we also took
 
03:11:12.590 --> 03:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
our two middle schools and turned them
 
03:11:16.910 --> 03:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
into a 56 and then a 78 so this is why
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
comp passion for these fourth graders
 
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
really really was needed because I told
 
03:11:22.870 --> 03:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
you about coming up to fourth grade now
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
they move into a 56 school then they
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
move into a 78 school and then they move
 
03:11:28.670 --> 03:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
into Pinkerton which is a wonderful
 
03:11:30.349 --> 03:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
school but is almost like a college
 
03:11:33.389 --> 03:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
campus so these there's a lot of value
 
03:11:35.429 --> 03:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
in consistency in education and I
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
recognize that moving from one school to
 
03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
another is inconsistency but there's
 
03:11:42.750 --> 03:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:45.630 --> 03:11:45.640 align:start position:0%
bullies thank you our representative
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you and thank you just
 
03:11:51.150 --> 03:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
curious in this particular situation
 
03:11:52.590 --> 03:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
where you're mentioning it sounds like
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's an abundance of fourth graders
 
03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
that may be unhappy how would that be
 
03:11:59.550 --> 03:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
navigated are you thinking a lottery
 
03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
system um thank you for the question I
 
03:12:03.510 --> 03:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
would leave that up to the districts but
 
03:12:05.309 --> 03:12:05.319 align:start position:0%
I think the most Fair would be just to
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
process them on a first in first out or
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
to have a lottery system um either to
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
pick one of the two because if you had a
 
03:12:13.630 --> 03:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
whole pile in front of you and you could
 
03:12:16.269 --> 03:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
choose which kids to accommodate um that
 
03:12:17.910 --> 03:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
would introduce a a lot of problems and
 
03:12:20.469 --> 03:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions so I would prefer to
 
03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
allow the districts to either have a
 
03:12:24.429 --> 03:12:24.439 align:start position:0%
first in first out or a lottery process
 
03:12:26.590 --> 03:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
where they would set a date um because
 
03:12:30.389 --> 03:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:32.510 --> 03:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
Equitable represent
 
03:12:34.590 --> 03:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman Celli good
 
03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
to see you
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
back good afternoon um I want to follow
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
up I I did I want to follow up on rent
 
03:12:45.630 --> 03:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
Damon's question Le the the pot on line
 
03:12:46.910 --> 03:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
seven was talking about the private
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
account of private school so you going
 
03:12:51.070 --> 03:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
to request a couple questions I Mr CH
 
03:12:52.469 --> 03:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
you going to request a change to that to
 
03:12:56.950 --> 03:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
take that out sorry on line seven where
 
03:13:01.030 --> 03:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
it says public school private Academy or
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
um private school within the district um
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
and you said that was not your intent in
 
03:13:07.030 --> 03:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
the bill because obviously if they're in
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
the school district I understand that
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
part so are you going to file an
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
amendment to take that out uh yes I will
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
file an amendment to take out approv
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
private school um the public Academy is
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
like Pinkerton or Co Brown um and with
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
that in my town the only school we send
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
to is Pinkerton but I know there are
 
03:13:28.990 --> 03:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
some schools where they have a number of
 
03:13:30.830 --> 03:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
different options and Pinkerton is
 
03:13:32.429 --> 03:13:32.439 align:start position:0%
essentially a public school even though
 
03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
legally it is a public Academy so I
 
03:13:36.510 --> 03:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be Equitable to
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
students in other sending towns that
 
03:13:40.229 --> 03:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
have multiple options to exclude them
 
03:13:42.110 --> 03:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
from attending Pinkerton so I will
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
remove the approved private school but I
 
03:13:45.630 --> 03:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
think it's prudent to leave the public
 
03:13:48.269 --> 03:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
Academy okay want follow follow thank
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
you ch um so just to fall off to that
 
03:13:55.429 --> 03:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
then um going back to initial um uh
 
03:13:57.429 --> 03:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
rationale for the bill that some
 
03:13:59.150 --> 03:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
youngsters are legitimately stuck in the
 
03:14:01.269 --> 03:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
school building that they shouldn't be
 
03:14:03.150 --> 03:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
and then except for the seat capacity I
 
03:14:04.830 --> 03:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
think you said there they should have an
 
03:14:05.950 --> 03:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
option to go somewhere else within the
 
03:14:08.309 --> 03:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
school district um I'm not suggesting
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's bad my question is why we want to
 
03:14:13.710 --> 03:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
have the RSA that tell the
 
03:14:15.269 --> 03:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent the local school board
 
03:14:17.950 --> 03:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
how to how to manage their school
 
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question we've
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
already given them the flexibility and
 
03:14:23.389 --> 03:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
this is not just a dairy problem I heard
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
from people around the state that their
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
best interest placements are rejected
 
03:14:29.550 --> 03:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
without a reason um this is about
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
accommodating students and as I'm sure
 
03:14:33.670 --> 03:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
you're aware there is a mental health
 
03:14:35.790 --> 03:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
crisis and we are seeing too many kids
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with bullying that take a
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
permanent solution to bullying um that's
 
03:14:43.590 --> 03:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
one of the areas where a lot of times um
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
I've heard that a lot of superintendent
 
03:14:47.309 --> 03:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
say stay there figure it out out you
 
03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
need to figure out how to work with your
 
03:14:51.469 --> 03:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
bully that doesn't always work and
 
03:14:53.309 --> 03:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
providing this option for students to
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
change schools to get away from a bully
 
03:14:57.389 --> 03:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
or even get away from a bad F friend
 
03:14:59.830 --> 03:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
group because as you know sometimes you
 
03:15:02.070 --> 03:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
may have made certain life choices and
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
then want to change what you're doing
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if every superintendent
 
03:15:08.429 --> 03:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
will understand that a child has started
 
03:15:10.269 --> 03:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
to run with a bad crowd they've decided
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
that they want a new crowd and the best
 
03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
way to do that is to move schools that
 
03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
is a very very valid reason to move
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
schools because that's the whole whole
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
the students whole future a lot is
 
03:15:22.150 --> 03:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
determined by the people that you spend
 
03:15:26.030 --> 03:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
time with and um and there's still an
 
03:15:28.349 --> 03:15:28.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a valid reason to say no
 
03:15:30.349 --> 03:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
I just think that for the for default
 
03:15:32.269 --> 03:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
answer should be yes okay thank you
 
03:15:37.229 --> 03:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:40.269 --> 03:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you um Mr chair and thank
 
03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing this
 
03:15:44.389 --> 03:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
bill forward I I just a quick side note
 
03:15:46.349 --> 03:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
before my question is um uh four years
 
03:15:48.070 --> 03:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
on the m the school board I can't even
 
03:15:50.229 --> 03:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
begin to tell you how many times parents
 
03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
had requested that their children be
 
03:15:53.790 --> 03:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
moved even under the Manifest hardship
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
and they were refused with no
 
03:15:58.950 --> 03:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
explanation so this bill basically says
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
that um this is to address the lack of
 
03:16:03.030 --> 03:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
the transparency around the rejection by
 
03:16:05.150 --> 03:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
the superintendent is that correct that
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
is a large part of it yes thank
 
03:16:10.429 --> 03:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:16:14.349 --> 03:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you and thank you I mas
 
03:16:18.830 --> 03:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
two questions start with one one okay um
 
03:16:21.349 --> 03:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
well it prompted that my fault um okay
 
03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
so my first question is I understand the
 
03:16:26.710 --> 03:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
part about the transparency but it is
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
also stating that they they absolutely
 
03:16:31.189 --> 03:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
must adhere to this correct unless
 
03:16:33.790 --> 03:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
there's a spatial
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
issue so it says in number two that if
 
03:16:39.550 --> 03:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
the superint the existing language is if
 
03:16:41.070 --> 03:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
the superintendent does not find that
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of the student
 
03:16:43.750 --> 03:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
to change the student school or
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
assignment the parent or Guardian May
 
03:16:48.110 --> 03:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
request a hearing for manic Fest
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
educational and
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
um and within that it says within 10
 
03:16:55.150 --> 03:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
days following such decision the
 
03:16:56.550 --> 03:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent shall provide a written
 
03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
report to the parenter guardian Pro Prov
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
providing the reasons why the request
 
03:17:03.790 --> 03:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
cannot be accommodated so with that the
 
03:17:05.309 --> 03:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent would need to say why
 
03:17:07.630 --> 03:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
they are saying no to the request for
 
03:17:10.349 --> 03:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
the the best placement change by knowing
 
03:17:12.750 --> 03:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
the reason for rejection that creates a
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
better process for the Manifest
 
03:17:17.070 --> 03:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
educational hardship and for the School
 
03:17:19.630 --> 03:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
Board to actually know what is going on
 
03:17:21.389 --> 03:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
um there may be some very very valid
 
03:17:23.189 --> 03:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
reason why a student can't be
 
03:17:25.309 --> 03:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
accommodated at a different school but
 
03:17:27.469 --> 03:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
instead of saying my answer is no and
 
03:17:29.469 --> 03:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to tell you why it
 
03:17:31.389 --> 03:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
requires a superintendent to make that
 
03:17:33.309 --> 03:17:33.319 align:start position:0%
information public and given that the
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
superintendents in are in charge of
 
03:17:37.469 --> 03:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
running the school school district and
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
the school board is in charge of hiring
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that sole employee the
 
03:17:43.510 --> 03:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent there should be that
 
03:17:45.870 --> 03:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
transparency to say why the
 
03:17:47.469 --> 03:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
superintendent isn't and accommodating
 
03:17:47.479 --> 03:17:49.150 align:start position:0%
superintendent isn't and accommodating
these

03:17:49.150 --> 03:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:17:51.950 --> 03:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
changes did you have another question I
 
03:17:54.510 --> 03:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
did thank you uh just regarding
 
03:17:57.309 --> 03:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation how would that work uh
 
03:17:59.150 --> 03:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you in the best interest placement
 
03:18:00.910 --> 03:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
law it already says that the parent is
 
03:18:02.830 --> 03:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for the transportation and
 
03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
this would not change that perfect thank
 
03:18:09.469 --> 03:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
you yes representative thank you chair
 
03:18:09.479 --> 03:18:11.150 align:start position:0%
you yes representative thank you chair
um

03:18:11.150 --> 03:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:14.590 --> 03:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative have you ever heard of a
 
03:18:18.510 --> 03:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
study by shakel Anderson wolf in
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
2016 which shows that there are better
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
student outcomes when you provide them
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
with student choice and does that sound
 
03:18:28.670 --> 03:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
um sort of consistent with what you have
 
03:18:30.590 --> 03:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
already studied about school choice and
 
03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for students thank you
 
03:18:33.790 --> 03:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I'm not sure if I've read
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
that particular study but yes um when
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
you have the agency on the buyin to your
 
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
education and you're an active part of
 
03:18:43.229 --> 03:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
choosing that path students are more
 
03:18:45.710 --> 03:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
involved which leads to better outcomes
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
um quite frankly we do already have some
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
school choice options within the state
 
03:18:51.790 --> 03:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
and this enhances the IND District
 
03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
Choice which I think is really really
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
critical because if a student can stay
 
03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
in the district but still meet their
 
03:19:00.429 --> 03:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
needs then that that doesn't really
 
03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
change much except that individual's
 
03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
experience and um I think that it's both
 
03:19:07.870 --> 03:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
economically sound and the right thing
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
Learners yes represent Terry thank you
 
03:19:18.309 --> 03:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
um so so um I I've heard you reference
 
03:19:21.910 --> 03:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
Derry and uh allude to other districts
 
03:19:24.910 --> 03:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
um where there are multiple choices that
 
03:19:27.750 --> 03:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
would be available as are not the case
 
03:19:30.030 --> 03:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
in many smaller communities do you have
 
03:19:32.229 --> 03:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
any sense how many families and students
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
might potentially benefit from um this
 
03:19:37.309 --> 03:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
change that you're recommending um thank
 
03:19:38.510 --> 03:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
you for the question I don't know the
 
03:19:40.910 --> 03:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
numbers because a lot of people are even
 
03:19:42.429 --> 03:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
afraid to speak out that they had asked
 
03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
for these accommodations I put this out
 
03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
on one of the more
 
03:19:50.830 --> 03:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh vocal Community groups in my P my
 
03:19:53.229 --> 03:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
town and some of the responses from
 
03:19:55.469 --> 03:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
people on the Schoolboard and others
 
03:19:57.950 --> 03:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
within sort of um one particular mindset
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
within the town were um very unkind to
 
03:20:03.229 --> 03:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
parents who would think to move their
 
03:20:05.950 --> 03:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
child from their assigned school because
 
03:20:07.429 --> 03:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
there's other students who might not be
 
03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
able to move and because some other
 
03:20:11.590 --> 03:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
student might not be able to move and
 
03:20:14.269 --> 03:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
have that choice they said that nobody
 
03:20:16.070 --> 03:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
should have the chance Choice the
 
03:20:18.550 --> 03:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to move I found that very
 
03:20:20.389 --> 03:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
very distressing it's almost like saying
 
03:20:21.630 --> 03:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
that because there's people who can't
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
walk I shouldn't be able to walk um it's
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
it's quite an offensive statement to say
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
that you need to be locked into a
 
03:20:30.389 --> 03:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
particular School based on your address
 
03:20:32.670 --> 03:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
but because of that mindset and the
 
03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
people that were piling on there's a lot
 
03:20:36.229 --> 03:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
of people who are afraid to speak
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
publicly about their desire to move
 
03:20:40.990 --> 03:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
schools um especially because it's seen
 
03:20:44.389 --> 03:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
as anti-school or anti-teacher in order
 
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
to speak out about the challenges in
 
03:20:47.309 --> 03:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
their town so I've heard from people
 
03:20:49.630 --> 03:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
privately but I have not heard as much
 
03:20:51.030 --> 03:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
publicly because people are afraid of
 
03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
pressure thank you and thank you for
 
03:20:59.070 --> 03:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
identifying the differences of opinion
 
03:20:59.080 --> 03:20:59.910 align:start position:0%
identifying the differences of opinion
that

03:20:59.910 --> 03:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:03.790 --> 03:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
occur uh amongst uh parents in in these
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
schools um but potentially what we're
 
03:21:10.790 --> 03:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
looking at is that it would seem is a
 
03:21:14.510 --> 03:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
significant number of families and and
 
03:21:16.830 --> 03:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
students who might take advantage of
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
this because if I'm getting this right
 
03:21:20.910 --> 03:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong we're looking at
 
03:21:23.590 --> 03:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
all the districts that have multiple
 
03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
elementary schools multiple middle
 
03:21:28.830 --> 03:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
schools multiple high schools where so
 
03:21:30.670 --> 03:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
where this could occur so that's a
 
03:21:33.469 --> 03:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
substantial number that could take
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
advantage of of this if the bill were to
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
be passed correct uh based on space in
 
03:21:41.229 --> 03:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
the other schools yes yes and I think
 
03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
that that would be an important signal
 
03:21:44.550 --> 03:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
because if a school has that many
 
03:21:46.590 --> 03:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
families unhappy with what's been off
 
03:21:49.469 --> 03:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
offered um then that school needs more
 
03:21:51.070 --> 03:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
um attention from the school board and
 
03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
the superintendent to make sure that
 
03:21:53.630 --> 03:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're meeting the needs of those
 
03:21:55.590 --> 03:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
families because if we have a school
 
03:21:57.670 --> 03:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
that everybody wants to flee we have a
 
03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
really big problem especially for those
 
03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
students who can't move that school and
 
03:22:04.469 --> 03:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
if those students that want to move
 
03:22:06.550 --> 03:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
become those canaries in a CO mine and
 
03:22:09.269 --> 03:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
let people know that people want out of
 
03:22:11.469 --> 03:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
um I'll use my school which was an
 
03:22:12.990 --> 03:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
amazing Elementary if everybody wants
 
03:22:14.429 --> 03:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
out a Westlake Elementary because
 
03:22:16.510 --> 03:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
they're having problems then that tells
 
03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
tells you that it needs to be fixed for
 
03:22:21.070 --> 03:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
everybody um I'm hopeful that that won't
 
03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
happen but I'm even more concerned that
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
we won't have those signals and kids
 
03:22:28.710 --> 03:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
will continue to stay in an educational
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
environment that lots and lots of people
 
03:22:32.630 --> 03:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to live leave just because we don't
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:38.469 --> 03:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
information any represent Damon thank
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair you mentioned at the
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
beginning of your remarks and thank you
 
03:22:45.150 --> 03:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question that lack of
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
capacity space Capac in a school could
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
be a reason that the request was
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
declined are there other legitimate
 
03:22:54.070 --> 03:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
reasons that you've entertained where a
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
request would be
 
03:22:57.630 --> 03:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
declined um thank you for the question I
 
03:22:59.710 --> 03:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
can't think of them but I don't really
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
want to tie their hands there may be
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
some reason why it can't be met and
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's why the superintendent would need
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
to share that with the parent and the
 
03:23:10.590 --> 03:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
school board because if a reason was
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
given and others didn't agree that it
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
was valid then there would be a process
 
03:23:16.630 --> 03:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
to appeal and overturn that but I don't
 
03:23:18.910 --> 03:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
want to tie the hands of the schools um
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking to mandate exactly what
 
03:23:23.910 --> 03:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
they do I'm except for the fact that
 
03:23:25.750 --> 03:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
they are to listen to the parents first
 
03:23:27.990 --> 03:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
on moving their child um I think that
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
that is a pretty low bar of requirement
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
especially because those F because
 
03:23:34.070 --> 03:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
families are able to leave the schools
 
03:23:36.150 --> 03:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
already I want them to stay in
 
03:23:38.429 --> 03:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
District because I'm an all of the above
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
school choice person I want really
 
03:23:42.790 --> 03:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
strong public schools and I want a whole
 
03:23:44.950 --> 03:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
variety of options and I think this will
 
03:23:49.349 --> 03:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.710 --> 03:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
Schools see no further questions thank
 
03:23:54.269 --> 03:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
you very much representative thank you
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
and uh we move from a a representative
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:08.950 --> 03:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
Lon welcome to the education policy
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee good afternoon chairman
 
03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
03:24:14.870 --> 03:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
having me um my wife's a tough fact to
 
03:24:17.229 --> 03:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
follow um we both both have strongly
 
03:24:19.150 --> 03:24:19.160 align:start position:0%
valued education which is where I think
 
03:24:22.030 --> 03:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is coming from if I can very
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
briefly I I think it's worth mentioning
 
03:24:26.790 --> 03:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
we have such a rich history in our state
 
03:24:29.389 --> 03:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
with respect to education um three
 
03:24:31.189 --> 03:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
people who I think everyone in this room
 
03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
knows I'm going to go back to a book
 
03:24:34.150 --> 03:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
from 1848 called the lives of the
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
signers of the Declaration of
 
03:24:37.870 --> 03:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
Independence Josiah Bartlett was an
 
03:24:39.710 --> 03:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
immigrant from Massachusetts it was a
 
03:24:42.349 --> 03:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
separate State a foreign State um
 
03:24:48.910 --> 03:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm from California it's just as bad
 
03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.189 --> 03:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
that um so what a lot of people may not
 
03:25:01.150 --> 03:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
know there's Josiah Bartlet Center here
 
03:25:03.189 --> 03:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
now but he was a troubled child he had
 
03:25:05.469 --> 03:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
problems with education what worked for
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
him it was actually a hybrid education
 
03:25:10.189 --> 03:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
where he drove his own education at home
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
after that family friends someone with
 
03:25:13.510 --> 03:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
the last name of Wentworth who I think a
 
03:25:14.910 --> 03:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
lot of people have heard I went to grad
 
03:25:17.229 --> 03:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
school at Dartmouth um um pretty big
 
03:25:19.070 --> 03:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
name in the state actually mentored him
 
03:25:20.950 --> 03:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
he didn't do so bad at 16 he entered the
 
03:25:22.269 --> 03:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
field of medicine which was not an
 
03:25:24.469 --> 03:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
untypical age at the time that's what
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
worked for him um William
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
Whipple grew up a little poorer um he
 
03:25:32.469 --> 03:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
was native actually born in KY New
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is now kid
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
main he went to a public school which at
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
the time was called a common school a
 
03:25:42.150 --> 03:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
school for commoners he absolutely
 
03:25:44.110 --> 03:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
excelled there not only through hard
 
03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
work but through the mentorship of his
 
03:25:45.680 --> 03:25:47.510 align:start position:0%
work but through the mentorship of his
parents

03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:25:48.990 --> 03:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
after school he wound up going out in
 
03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
the ocean he was a seafer he and his
 
03:25:52.750 --> 03:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
brother had learned enough they became
 
03:25:54.389 --> 03:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs and were very successful
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
after that the rest is history there I'm
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
focusing there's much known about them
 
03:25:59.790 --> 03:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to just stick to their their
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
educational choices Matthew thoron was
 
03:26:03.550 --> 03:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
actually an immigrant from Ireland a
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
little further away across the pond as
 
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues in Ireland would
 
03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
say um I don't drink whiskey so not let
 
03:26:11.710 --> 03:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
others argue over where uh the best
 
03:26:13.670 --> 03:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
stuff comes from but long story short
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
Matthew Thorton grew up in a very very
 
03:26:18.429 --> 03:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
wealthy family when he immigrated here
 
03:26:20.110 --> 03:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
he not only had no trouble getting into
 
03:26:22.229 --> 03:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
Medical School his family name carried
 
03:26:24.030 --> 03:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
him into medical school and the same
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
Governor Wentworth that was friendly to
 
03:26:28.950 --> 03:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
Josiah Bartlett actually open doors if
 
03:26:31.830 --> 03:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
you will um for Matthew Thorton so three
 
03:26:34.389 --> 03:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
very important people in our history
 
03:26:35.710 --> 03:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
three people that are very involved in
 
03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
writing of the Constitution where we get
 
03:26:41.469 --> 03:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
article 84 from oh sorry article 83 um
 
03:26:44.710 --> 03:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
if we fast forward today today um just
 
03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
going to share I've taught many things
 
03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
I've taught scuba diving which is pretty
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
cool thing I've taught classes there I
 
03:26:52.070 --> 03:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
was sharing with my wife on the way up
 
03:26:53.830 --> 03:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
one of the best classes I taught was a
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
school was a class of death students and
 
03:26:58.349 --> 03:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
apparently I did really well they
 
03:27:00.790 --> 03:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
listened so well above water when we
 
03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
went below there was no remedial
 
03:27:04.510 --> 03:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
training needed that had never happened
 
03:27:06.030 --> 03:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
it it was the easiest class I've ever
 
03:27:08.670 --> 03:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
taught and then I had three more um they
 
03:27:10.269 --> 03:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
were very different from some of the
 
03:27:11.830 --> 03:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
other special needs students I've had
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
I've coached Special Olympics let me
 
03:27:16.189 --> 03:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
tell you you see a special Olympian
 
03:27:17.830 --> 03:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
crossing over the Finish Line he'll be
 
03:27:20.309 --> 03:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
in tears it's pretty cool they're just
 
03:27:22.269 --> 03:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
as excited when I see my son hit a home
 
03:27:24.910 --> 03:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
run they're just as excited it's really
 
03:27:27.189 --> 03:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
cool to see that's education and I was
 
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
only one person in their life I've
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
taught at The Graduate level I've taught
 
03:27:32.269 --> 03:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
at the postgraduate level I still teach
 
03:27:34.670 --> 03:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
medical medical education and
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
oncology um I've taught first aid ba
 
03:27:40.030 --> 03:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
basic life support I've taught CPR to
 
03:27:42.189 --> 03:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters in New Hampshire a wide
 
03:27:44.429 --> 03:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
breath and one thing I can tell you I've
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
had a lot of amazing mentors every
 
03:27:48.389 --> 03:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
single teacher has a different teaching
 
03:27:50.469 --> 03:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
style everyone has a different teaching
 
03:27:52.670 --> 03:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
style if you have any of you haven't
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
read a book called The Last lecture it's
 
03:27:56.189 --> 03:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
worth reading put politics aside read
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
this last lecture this person was
 
03:27:59.910 --> 03:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer which
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
is an invariably fatal disease he gave a
 
03:28:05.710 --> 03:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
talk that it it is uh it's breathtaking
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
or you can read the book or both um so
 
03:28:10.189 --> 03:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
every teacher has a different teaching
 
03:28:12.150 --> 03:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
style and I think we've all seen this in
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
our own personal Journeys so too does
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
every student and not all of them match
 
03:28:18.590 --> 03:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
not all of them will
 
03:28:21.229 --> 03:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
match this bill
 
03:28:23.910 --> 03:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
provides a second set of eyes and if you
 
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
go back to our Constitution Article four
 
03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
the right of conscious this preserves it
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
for the parents within our district
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen bullying we've seen politics
 
03:28:35.750 --> 03:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
enter the classroom um some of the stuff
 
03:28:38.189 --> 03:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
is absolutely amazing who better to
 
03:28:41.229 --> 03:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
guide education than parents to say you
 
03:28:43.269 --> 03:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
know what Junior's having a big problem
 
03:28:44.429 --> 03:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
in school
 
03:28:47.429 --> 03:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
X it could be the school it maybe it's a
 
03:28:49.389 --> 03:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
great school just that particular
 
03:28:51.269 --> 03:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
teacher or the culture at the school is
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
not a good fit for the student merely
 
03:28:56.189 --> 03:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
switching them it changes things if I
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
can a quick example my two boys my
 
03:29:01.150 --> 03:29:01.160 align:start position:0%
younger one who's 10 Eli you ask him his
 
03:29:03.189 --> 03:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
favorite subject and grab a cup of
 
03:29:04.229 --> 03:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
coffee because he's goingon to talk to
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
you about math thank
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
you his older brother Mike who is 12
 
03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
he'll do math he used to hate math you
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
put it in terms of Aeronautics he loves
 
03:29:16.830 --> 03:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
everything PLS I can't teach itics I can
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
gu I can guide them to someone who can
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
giving students the choice our Public
 
03:29:21.950 --> 03:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
Schools we have some great public
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
schools now this provides a no cost
 
03:29:26.950 --> 03:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
alternative for parents and students to
 
03:29:28.910 --> 03:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
provide feedback within a district to
 
03:29:31.389 --> 03:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
say a particular School a particular
 
03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
teacher is performing well to fit my
 
03:29:34.080 --> 03:29:35.189 align:start position:0%
teacher is performing well to fit my
students

03:29:35.189 --> 03:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:29:37.550 --> 03:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
needs I think as representative Le and
 
03:29:40.229 --> 03:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
my wife testified earlier if there's
 
03:29:42.150 --> 03:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
significant feedback about one school or
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
one teacher I hope we don't see that but
 
03:29:45.630 --> 03:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
if that happens maybe that's something
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
to dis needs to evaluate this uh this
 
03:29:50.830 --> 03:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
empowers parents to get give the optimal
 
03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes for their own children I'm
 
03:29:55.750 --> 03:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions thank you very
 
03:29:58.510 --> 03:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
much any
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you very much
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you kindly thank you for being
 
03:30:08.590 --> 03:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
here um is there anyone else oh
 
03:30:18.950 --> 03:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:21.150 --> 03:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
that's I just want to go in front of you
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:29.309 --> 03:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
see okay good afternoon my name is
 
03:30:32.469 --> 03:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
Deborah how I uh good afternoon chairman
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
cordelli it's good to be in front of the
 
03:30:36.590 --> 03:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
house education policy committee again
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Deborah house I am president
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the American Federation of teachers
 
03:30:42.990 --> 03:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and at this time I have to
 
03:30:45.030 --> 03:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition of this bill if we
 
03:30:46.990 --> 03:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
lived in an ideal School uh world where
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
all our schools gave the same
 
03:30:52.189 --> 03:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a robust public
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
education I would be in favor of this
 
03:30:56.349 --> 03:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
bill but since that is not the case in
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire even within the same
 
03:31:00.309 --> 03:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
school district I have to speak in
 
03:31:04.469 --> 03:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
opposition so um as we know every Grand
 
03:31:07.229 --> 03:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
State child has the opportunity for a
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
robust public education no matter where
 
03:31:12.510 --> 03:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
they we no matter what district they
 
03:31:12.520 --> 03:31:14.309 align:start position:0%
they we no matter what district they
live

03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
live
 
03:31:18.990 --> 03:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
in but well this just deals with uh the
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity within the same district
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
because our districts do not get
 
03:31:27.950 --> 03:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
adequate funding for that robust public
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
education where students have small
 
03:31:31.950 --> 03:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
class sizes all the academic and
 
03:31:34.269 --> 03:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
behavioral support they need uh and
 
03:31:36.870 --> 03:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
rigorous curriculum we have districts
 
03:31:38.790 --> 03:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
that have to make choices they have to
 
03:31:40.469 --> 03:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
do things like concentrate support
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
services for certain kinds of academic
 
03:31:46.469 --> 03:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
or behavioral needs in certain schools
 
03:31:49.469 --> 03:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
if a parent comes up and says you know I
 
03:31:50.990 --> 03:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
feel it's in the best interest of my
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
child to be in another school and the
 
03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
default answer is that the
 
03:31:57.990 --> 03:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent has to transfer the child
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
you are possibly moving the student away
 
03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
from the support services they need
 
03:32:06.070 --> 03:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
because maybe those services are located
 
03:32:07.910 --> 03:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the school the parent wants to move
 
03:32:12.030 --> 03:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
them out of um you are
 
03:32:15.349 --> 03:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
also forcing the district to say no to
 
03:32:17.229 --> 03:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
the parent even though that may be you
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
know what they would um really like to
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
do is work as a team with the parent or
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
incur expense by having the support
 
03:32:27.630 --> 03:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
staff travel to the school that the
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
parent wants to transfer the child into
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
or hire additional uh
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
staff if you are incurring expense for
 
03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
the Local District isn't that an
 
03:32:38.030 --> 03:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate we had a little lecture
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
about that last week um for those
 
03:32:44.429 --> 03:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
reasons the automatic assumption that
 
03:32:47.429 --> 03:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
the district has to agree AG ree to any
 
03:32:49.229 --> 03:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
request from a parent that the parent
 
03:32:51.910 --> 03:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
say is in the best register of the child
 
03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
I have to object to this um I also don't
 
03:32:58.269 --> 03:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
see in here that there is anywhere where
 
03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
the parents and the district work
 
03:33:04.990 --> 03:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
together to try and solve whatever issue
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
has come up that makes the parent
 
03:33:09.229 --> 03:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
believe the school is not the best fit
 
03:33:12.269 --> 03:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
for the child um you know has there been
 
03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
any attempt to solve the issue within
 
03:33:16.030 --> 03:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
the school before transferring I I
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
understand the example where the school
 
03:33:20.309 --> 03:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
is closed there's no working around that
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
but um in many instances the school is
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
still open and is there any interim step
 
03:33:26.279 --> 03:33:26.950 align:start position:0%
still open and is there any interim step
in

03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
between um there's a lot of concerns
 
03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill there's a short timeline
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
10 days for the superintendent to turn
 
03:33:36.870 --> 03:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
it around um it seems
 
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
to be asking a lot of our school
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
districts to reply to requests and and
 
03:33:49.229 --> 03:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
not giving them a lot of room to work
 
03:33:51.469 --> 03:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with families and that's
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
when students get the best results when
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
parents and the school Community
 
03:34:00.150 --> 03:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
teachers administrators superintendents
 
03:34:02.189 --> 03:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
work together all focused on the best
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
interest of the child so for those
 
03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
reasons I have to oppose this bill as it
 
03:34:11.950 --> 03:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
is written and when we have great Public
 
03:34:15.150 --> 03:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
Schools all across the St state in every
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
District and every school within the
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
districts then we can talk about having
 
03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
Universal school choice thank you and we
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
oppose this Bill thank you yes
 
03:34:28.429 --> 03:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for uh taking my
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
question in your opinion would this bill
 
03:34:36.750 --> 03:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
have any effect or influence on our
 
03:34:39.630 --> 03:34:39.640 align:start position:0%
smaller neighborhood
 
03:34:43.870 --> 03:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
schools it would have some influence um
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
I know where I work some of those
 
03:34:49.150 --> 03:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
smaller neighborhood schools had
 
03:34:51.150 --> 03:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
concentrations of
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
support um for
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
students so you might have parents
 
03:34:59.550 --> 03:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
saying well I want to move my child out
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
of there to a different School in the
 
03:35:06.269 --> 03:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
city in Nashua because you know the test
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
scores don't look so good so maybe it's
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
not such a good school but then you will
 
03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
be moving your student away from a place
 
03:35:13.630 --> 03:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
03:35:16.349 --> 03:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
had smaller class size
 
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of academic support and into a
 
03:35:22.870 --> 03:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
bigger school where they didn't get as
 
03:35:25.830 --> 03:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
much individualized attention if you
 
03:35:27.429 --> 03:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
look at on paper the test scores in the
 
03:35:29.389 --> 03:35:29.399 align:start position:0%
smaller neighborhood schools actually
 
03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know might be a little bit lower on
 
03:35:33.309 --> 03:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
the aggregate but your students getting
 
03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
more support so
 
03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:39.229 align:start position:0%
more support so
um

03:35:39.229 --> 03:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
yeah you also have to be able to make
 
03:35:43.469 --> 03:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
sure a conversation is going on and that
 
03:35:45.309 --> 03:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
that there is a good exchange of
 
03:35:45.319 --> 03:35:46.710 align:start position:0%
that there is a good exchange of
information

03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:35:49.830 --> 03:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
before an
 
03:35:54.990 --> 03:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:59.309 --> 03:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
made follow um also in reference to this
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about title one so if I
 
03:36:04.349 --> 03:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
have a title one student that moves from
 
03:36:06.990 --> 03:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
a title one school I guess that person
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
would have to go to another Title One
 
03:36:11.550 --> 03:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
school but they might be requesting it a
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
school that is not so the services is
 
03:36:14.910 --> 03:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking oh yeah they
 
03:36:16.750 --> 03:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get if they went to a different
 
03:36:19.309 --> 03:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
school that didn't have whole school
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
Title One funding title one it's a
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
Federal grant that provides academic
 
03:36:26.910 --> 03:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
support and uh they would not get the
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
same level of support if they went to a
 
03:36:31.229 --> 03:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
school that did not have the same
 
03:36:33.269 --> 03:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
percentage of students living below the
 
03:36:35.910 --> 03:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
poverty level so there will be fewer
 
03:36:37.630 --> 03:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
adults in the school to support their
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
read their reading learning um or to
 
03:36:42.469 --> 03:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
support their math
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
learning thank
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
you yes representative McDonald thank
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
you chairman and thank you um the prime
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned a constitutional
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
provision that requires all districts to
 
03:36:57.870 --> 03:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
provide equal opportunities at all
 
03:37:00.510 --> 03:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
schools within that district and I know
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
that for a fact the case in my district
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
where we have five elementary schools
 
03:37:06.269 --> 03:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
and they all have comparable education
 
03:37:07.710 --> 03:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
but you reference that may not be the
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
case Statewide are you aware of a
 
03:37:13.309 --> 03:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
district where there's that's not true I
 
03:37:16.189 --> 03:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
know there are districts where they have
 
03:37:17.870 --> 03:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
concentrations uh you know through
 
03:37:19.070 --> 03:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
through different grants they have
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
concentrated support for students with
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
different needs learning needs in
 
03:37:27.990 --> 03:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
specific buildings so if you were to
 
03:37:30.910 --> 03:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
move your student away from that support
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
they would have a difficult time getting
 
03:37:35.790 --> 03:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
those learning needs met unless the
 
03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
district were then required to have
 
03:37:42.189 --> 03:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
staff travel which incurs an expense or
 
03:37:45.189 --> 03:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
hire more staff either way you you know
 
03:37:45.199 --> 03:37:46.110 align:start position:0%
hire more staff either way you you know
now

03:37:46.110 --> 03:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
putting an unfunded mandate on the
 
03:37:50.309 --> 03:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
district to meet those students needs if
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
I may have a follow-up question my
 
03:37:55.389 --> 03:37:55.399 align:start position:0%
understanding of this bill is that if
 
03:37:57.750 --> 03:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
the superintendent finds a valid reason
 
03:37:59.070 --> 03:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
then they don't have to accommodate the
 
03:38:01.790 --> 03:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
request is that not your understanding
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
well valid reason is not defined so when
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
something is very open-ended like that
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
you don't know what's included and
 
03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:10.110 align:start position:0%
you don't know what's included and
what's

03:38:10.110 --> 03:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
what's
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
not so you're you're leaving it open to
 
03:38:19.269 --> 03:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
interpretation which can be very um
 
03:38:19.279 --> 03:38:21.790 align:start position:0%
interpretation which can be very um
dangerous

03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
because we may agree but it's not
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
written down is
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
it if I may the prime sponsor indicated
 
03:38:32.349 --> 03:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
that spatial issues for example may be
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
something that constitutes this and I
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
would agree I would understand that what
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
you suggested if they are specializing
 
03:38:40.830 --> 03:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps English Lear language learner
 
03:38:42.910 --> 03:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
students at one school special needs
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
accommodations at another I would
 
03:38:46.910 --> 03:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
recognized that that is
 
03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
also a valid reason would you not agree
 
03:38:49.560 --> 03:38:50.510 align:start position:0%
also a valid reason would you not agree
with

03:38:50.510 --> 03:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we would hope that that would be
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
recognized but it also could lead to
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
more lawsuits are you comfortable
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
funding that from
 
03:39:03.389 --> 03:39:03.399 align:start position:0%
here are you
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
asking from from the state treasury you
 
03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
fund all the lawsuits
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah you know we'll address
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
the questions this okay well um yes
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
represent Freeman
 
03:39:18.150 --> 03:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
take thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:39:19.950 --> 03:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
question so if one of the scenarios I'd
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
like to work up and get your opinion on
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
is if a child is being bullied
 
03:39:29.110 --> 03:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
relentlessly and all the modalities have
 
03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
been utilized to address that bullying
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
with the with the person who's allegedly
 
03:39:36.630 --> 03:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
doing the bullying the child the parents
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
and there's there's no resolution to it
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
and the child may be in visible danger
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
would you think that would be an
 
03:39:44.830 --> 03:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate reason to Grant the request
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
to move that child to a different
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
school with the hypothetical youst that
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like a classic case of manifest
 
03:39:54.389 --> 03:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
hardship and I believe those have been
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
granted I I can't speak in every
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
instance but that does sound like one
 
03:40:01.630 --> 03:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
that fits that um that statute Mr CH may
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
have a follow you may thank you so much
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe that actually I do
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
know requests that have been refused in
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
spite of manifest education hardship and
 
03:40:13.550 --> 03:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
these were the exact scenarios thank you
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent Morris than uh thank you
 
03:40:17.389 --> 03:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking the
 
03:40:19.710 --> 03:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
question uh so the wrong person just to
 
03:40:22.070 --> 03:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
kind of wrap it up and
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
um the subject of math for instance
 
03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
let's say you know we got two Geniuses
 
03:40:29.229 --> 03:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
sitting here in the room right and let's
 
03:40:32.269 --> 03:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
say they're in their current elementary
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
schools don't offer the same curriculum
 
03:40:36.229 --> 03:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
as let's say the next Elementary School
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
within the same district maybe the other
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum is a little bit harder and
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
more challenging for the student so and
 
03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this this big for
 
03:40:47.790 --> 03:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
instance would be kind of like a last
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
choice for when all negotiations fail so
 
03:40:52.510 --> 03:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
that way the parents have the ability to
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
send their kids the school that would
 
03:40:56.790 --> 03:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
best challenge their needs at that
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
time am I wrong I don't see anything in
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
here about all negotiations failing
 
03:41:04.110 --> 03:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
either so that that part would certainly
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
need to be uh stated a little more
 
03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
clearly and um you to get back to a
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
previous question having different
 
03:41:13.990 --> 03:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum in different schools in the
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
district is not something that I have
 
03:41:20.830 --> 03:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
encountered so with the exception of
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
high schools that sometimes
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
offer like in nsha North High School
 
03:41:27.269 --> 03:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
might offer a class that South doesn't
 
03:41:29.830 --> 03:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
but the students do indeed uh go back
 
03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
and forth if there's a class they want
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
take it one and they they attend the
 
03:41:35.790 --> 03:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
other um but they don't transfer schools
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh they just travel for the one class um
 
03:41:41.790 --> 03:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
there's a bridge between them you can
 
03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
walk um but
 
03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
um I do not know of any districts that
 
03:41:52.469 --> 03:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
have like a different curriculum at the
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
elementary level in one school than
 
03:41:54.960 --> 03:41:56.990 align:start position:0%
elementary level in one school than
another

03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:41:59.790 --> 03:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
So you you're asking a hypothetical that
 
03:42:02.309 --> 03:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know there's any place that does
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
a a situation like that Magnet School
 
03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
type thing again you want to fund every
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
school so they have a Bo curriculum then
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
can have them start specializing and
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
have magnet schools so you solved the
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
first problem we'll work on the
 
03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
second yes Ros
 
03:42:21.229 --> 03:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
har uh I noted that among the uh several
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh objections uh that you cited with
 
03:42:26.910 --> 03:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the bill that you mentioned I
 
03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
recall unless you correct me uh for
 
03:42:32.950 --> 03:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
having misheard that uh the
 
03:42:36.149 --> 03:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
10day uh 10day specified here following
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
the decision being made was a short
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
turnaround time and I'm just trying to
 
03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
understand um if a decision is made
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
presumably there's a reason why the
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
decision was made and I'm wondering why
 
03:42:51.229 --> 03:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
it would take more than 10 days to
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
communicate a decision and the reason
 
03:42:55.990 --> 03:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
for the decision and if it's not enough
 
03:42:57.750 --> 03:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
time why would it not be enough time and
 
03:43:00.830 --> 03:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
how much more time do you think would be
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
uh ideal to allow for a decision of no
 
03:43:10.950 --> 03:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:13.469 --> 03:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I'm just going to withdraw
 
03:43:17.950 --> 03:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:43:21.510 --> 03:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
um I was speaking not looking at my
 
03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
notes of and I was thinking it was a
 
03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
10day time to make the decision and
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
communicate not to communicate once you
 
03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
made the decision so I got ahead of
 
03:43:35.189 --> 03:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
myself in in my thoughts there so um yes
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank 10 days would be short to go
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
through the whole process but not to
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
tell people once you have made your
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
decision you are correct thank you very
 
03:43:45.550 --> 03:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
much for that um any further question
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh seen none thank you very
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
testimony um I think we have one more
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:04.520 --> 03:44:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
up

03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.670 --> 03:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
the committee Jerry F Associated
 
03:44:14.309 --> 03:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
executive director New Hampshire school
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
administrators Association I had not
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
planned to testify uh on this bill but
 
03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
several questions came to mind during
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
listening to testimony that I just um
 
03:44:26.670 --> 03:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
would would think that it's important to
 
03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
have as part of the discussion uh
 
03:44:31.469 --> 03:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
determining what to do with it um the
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
word shall seems to suggest this little
 
03:44:36.670 --> 03:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
discretion um in the in the
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
decision-making process and um certainly
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know folks want to do uh what is
 
03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of kids um a
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
valid reason suggest I'm not quite sure
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
what valid reason means and and I think
 
03:44:54.910 --> 03:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
about this from the perspective of a
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent who was in a Regional
 
03:44:57.520 --> 03:44:58.469 align:start position:0%
superintendent who was in a Regional
School

03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
School
 
03:45:01.149 --> 03:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
District um we had one school board but
 
03:45:05.070 --> 03:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
seven towns and so if someone from New
 
03:45:07.550 --> 03:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
London wanted to send their child to
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
Warner because the parent worked in
 
03:45:13.990 --> 03:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
Warner and that was the the valid reason
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh to want to transfer a child to
 
03:45:22.389 --> 03:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
um Simon school would that have to be
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
accepted this whether or not the
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
population at Simon school I'm going to
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
say fourth grade uh had 15 students in
 
03:45:34.030 --> 03:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
it when um perhaps the the New London
 
03:45:38.429 --> 03:45:38.439 align:start position:0%
school had 15 but 15 in one Schoolhouse
 
03:45:39.510 --> 03:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
and those of you that have been in
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
education know well 15 students in one
 
03:45:46.269 --> 03:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
classroom can pres present one of
 
03:45:50.110 --> 03:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
um issues and 25 students in another
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
classroom could be very easy to deal
 
03:45:54.670 --> 03:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
with and not present any issues at all
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering does the discretion
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
does a valid reason be that that's those
 
03:46:03.309 --> 03:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
children that that classroom that you
 
03:46:08.229 --> 03:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
want in mner is filled with a number of
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues and frankly your
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
child in the Judgment of the Educators
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
is better served in the class of 25 in
 
03:46:19.110 --> 03:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
New London because there are no
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
discipline issues there achievements
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
high so what's the valid issue is it the
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
parents work need
 
03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm all about collaboration we are
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
all about collaboration with parents and
 
03:46:35.229 --> 03:46:35.239 align:start position:0%
trying to make the best Solutions but it
 
03:46:36.510 --> 03:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
would seem that we need a little bit
 
03:46:39.510 --> 03:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
more Direction in something like that um
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
and that was uh you know parents deserve
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
explanations I agree with the the the
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor parents deserve
 
03:46:50.149 --> 03:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
explanations plain and simple um 10 days
 
03:46:52.510 --> 03:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
representative plenty of time if if this
 
03:46:54.269 --> 03:46:54.279 align:start position:0%
body says 10 days it's 10 days it's 10
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
days we can do that that's not an issue
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so I just like would would ask that
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
you contemplate a little bit more
 
03:47:05.870 --> 03:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
definition around what's a valid reason
 
03:47:08.229 --> 03:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
and and compelling the
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
shall the shall can be problematic and
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.990 --> 03:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bon oh thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:21.910 --> 03:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
have um some questions about student
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
privacy issues having served on a school
 
03:47:29.830 --> 03:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
board um in my hometown for many years I
 
03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
know that whenever we had um special
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
education issues or issues with students
 
03:47:37.870 --> 03:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
that were requesting manifest hardship
 
03:47:40.910 --> 03:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
or transfers all um there literally is a
 
03:47:43.149 --> 03:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
wall put between the administration and
 
03:47:46.269 --> 03:47:46.279 align:start position:0%
the school board members we are not
 
03:47:49.950 --> 03:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to have that information um do
 
03:47:52.269 --> 03:47:52.279 align:start position:0%
you see any privacy student privacy
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
concerns in this thank you
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative for that question I do
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
see some uh some potential priv student
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
privacy issues because if the
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
superintendent um was required to to
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
make the placement um they might know
 
03:48:09.790 --> 03:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
based on the knowledge that they have
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
that that's not necessarily a great
 
03:48:15.030 --> 03:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
placement for an additional child but
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
you can't say it's not a great placement
 
03:48:19.790 --> 03:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
for any additional children because we
 
03:48:24.910 --> 03:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
classroom thank you resident
 
03:48:32.550 --> 03:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good afternoon again M um
 
03:48:33.950 --> 03:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
couple things in the bill I just want
 
03:48:36.389 --> 03:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
your opinion on it I I agree with
 
03:48:38.309 --> 03:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative Leon that that this may
 
03:48:41.790 --> 03:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
be a reasonable solution for boying um
 
03:48:43.830 --> 03:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
100% and sometimes that's the only
 
03:48:46.149 --> 03:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
solution um but I have a concern that
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of specificity when it
 
03:48:50.269 --> 03:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
talks about how many times during a
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
school year a youngster can move I'm
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about um what time in the
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
calendar you're going to allow that
 
03:48:59.189 --> 03:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
movement if it shall be whatever they
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
request it um and the third one I'm
 
03:49:02.349 --> 03:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
really concerned about I want you're
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
just quick syop those three three the
 
03:49:07.149 --> 03:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
third one I'm concerned about the the
 
03:49:10.229 --> 03:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
the all the data we have on learning
 
03:49:11.950 --> 03:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
that happens with youngsters who have
 
03:49:14.389 --> 03:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
multiple transfers to schools and the
 
03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
lack of in the there so could you give
 
03:49:18.510 --> 03:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
like a thumbnail on those three issues
 
03:49:20.429 --> 03:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
in your opinion from being
 
03:49:21.910 --> 03:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent thank you for the
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
question representative Woodcock
 
03:49:25.110 --> 03:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
certainly the number of transitions in a
 
03:49:26.510 --> 03:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
school year and the time of those
 
03:49:29.429 --> 03:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
transition I play a definite role in not
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
only the the achievement and the
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity for that student that's
 
03:49:35.910 --> 03:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
being uh transferred in but also the
 
03:49:38.269 --> 03:49:38.279 align:start position:0%
kind of the Dynamics if you will of the
 
03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
classroom and the and the rest of the uh
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
um the rest of the students and I would
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
also have concern again I'm going to go
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
back to the regional district Conway
 
03:49:49.990 --> 03:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
being one um sa6 Regional type things
 
03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
when you take a child during the school
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
year and and move them to a another town
 
03:49:57.630 --> 03:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
so to speak and change the the
 
03:49:59.950 --> 03:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
Friendship group change the Dynamics
 
03:50:03.149 --> 03:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
that that takes adjustment time um for
 
03:50:07.389 --> 03:50:07.399 align:start position:0%
everybody um and I I think that studies
 
03:50:09.309 --> 03:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
I can't cite the studies but I think
 
03:50:11.349 --> 03:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
good Common Sense would say that it
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
would be a disruptive piece and
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair any further
 
03:50:20.910 --> 03:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
03:50:23.590 --> 03:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative litfield
 
03:50:25.590 --> 03:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:50:28.149 --> 03:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
question so am I hearing you correctly
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
that if we set certain parameters around
 
03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
this where the change would take place
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
let's say whether it be the beginning of
 
03:50:39.229 --> 03:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
an academic year or let's say after the
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
winter break the Christmas break excuse
 
03:50:43.229 --> 03:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
me that that would be best and that
 
03:50:45.309 --> 03:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
would be and and I just want to take it
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
a step further I'm looking at this um I
 
03:50:51.510 --> 03:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
see pros and cons in this definitely I
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
can see both sides but we have someone
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
here that is saying I support school
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
choice but she's trying to keep it
 
03:50:59.510 --> 03:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
within the public school system so I
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
would think we would want to support
 
03:51:02.590 --> 03:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
that that's my concern so I'm just
 
03:51:04.830 --> 03:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
wondering what we could do best to serve
 
03:51:06.910 --> 03:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
this sure thank you for the question
 
03:51:06.920 --> 03:51:07.950 align:start position:0%
this sure thank you for the question
representative

03:51:07.950 --> 03:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:07.960 --> 03:51:10.229 align:start position:0%
representative
LEL

03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
LEL
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
um it's going to sound like a cop audien
 
03:51:14.349 --> 03:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
I think probably to some around this
 
03:51:16.110 --> 03:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
table but I think local decision- making
 
03:51:19.309 --> 03:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
is really important there um as a
 
03:51:21.389 --> 03:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent we accepted a high school
 
03:51:23.389 --> 03:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
transfer because of a bullying incident
 
03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
after the first quarter of a school year
 
03:51:26.670 --> 03:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
with a neighboring School District just
 
03:51:28.269 --> 03:51:28.279 align:start position:0%
a handshake between two superintendents
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah let's get this done um best
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
interest of the kid kid graduated from
 
03:51:35.309 --> 03:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
our high school
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
and lived happily ever after I guess I
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't know but there's a certain level
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
of even within our district there was
 
03:51:44.590 --> 03:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
there were policies that would allow
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
inter inter uh Town transfers so I guess
 
03:51:50.710 --> 03:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that the local
 
03:51:52.349 --> 03:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
decision-making process can deal with
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
some of these things uh and because they
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
know what's best that at that point in
 
03:51:57.359 --> 03:52:01.590 align:start position:0%
know what's best that at that point in
time

03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:05.229 --> 03:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much uh seeing no
 
03:52:07.229 --> 03:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
further questions um thank you very much
 
03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you and um
 
03:52:15.550 --> 03:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
we'll close the hearing on uh HB 68
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
um and we'll take a few minutes uh break
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%

384 which was a u bill regarding uh
 
04:14:09.119 --> 04:14:10.469 align:start position:0%
384 which was a u bill regarding uh
prohibiting

prohibiting
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
bullying um we have two more uh bills um
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
one of it one of which came in um just
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
recently regarding bullying also so what
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is um hold this
 
04:14:25.319 --> 04:14:27.070 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is um hold this
one

04:14:27.070 --> 04:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:14:30.830 --> 04:14:30.840 align:start position:0%

um uh the uh due date on it um but hold
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
this and get the other two done and then
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
maybe have a work session uh to talk
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
about the three bills and what we
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
actually need to do in terms of bullying
 
04:14:47.790 --> 04:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
I know some people had some concerns
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
with some of the provisions in
 
04:14:52.590 --> 04:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
384 um so we can talk over the three
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
bills and see what we actually want to
 
04:14:56.590 --> 04:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
do um on the
 
04:14:56.600 --> 04:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
do um on the
subject

04:14:58.800 --> 04:15:03.550 align:start position:0%
subject
okay

04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
um uh no don't have to yeah don't have
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:14.429 --> 04:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
it um the next one
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
is uh talk about HCR 6 the one we heard
 
04:15:19.600 --> 04:15:20.309 align:start position:0%
is uh talk about HCR 6 the one we heard
this

04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%

04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%

04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
all is talking about Emergency Shelters
 
04:18:04.630 --> 04:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
um the schools are often used for
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
emergency shelters in weather advents um
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
and who is responsible for checking the
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
status of those seeking shelter um when
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
you are in an emergency shelter
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
situation the children are not in school
 
04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
um so I don't understand the concern for
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh children's safety in the schools at
 
04:18:27.870 --> 04:18:27.880 align:start position:0%

04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
disease um one of the provisions of this
 
04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:39.000 align:start position:0%

04:18:41.149 --> 04:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
going to cost the state of New Hampshire
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%

for certain
 
04:19:03.950 --> 04:19:03.960 align:start position:0%

04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you chair
 
04:19:30.429 --> 04:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
Kelli um I don't know the intent of the
 
04:19:33.510 --> 04:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
theot maker of the motion but the other
 
04:19:35.070 --> 04:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
concern I brought up during the hearing
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
I'll bring up again that we have uh uh
 
04:19:41.790 --> 04:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
many schools that are available in the
 
04:19:41.800 --> 04:19:43.830 align:start position:0%
many schools that are available in the
summer

04:19:43.830 --> 04:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
summer
 
04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
um an open that could be used for
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
emergency shelter and I don't know why
 
04:19:53.070 --> 04:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
when I asked this the spokesperson that
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't there um it was sort of like a no
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
you can't use it at all um my my
 
04:20:00.309 --> 04:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
question is there are every school I
 
04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
mean I'm thinking my own Community we
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
have five schools two of I know are
 
04:20:06.550 --> 04:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
doing the year summer so I to the open
 
04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
so just why we why would we prohibit
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
every school district saying you can't
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
provide emergency shelter when you have
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
emergency fac is there that doesn't make
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
much sense to me I mean where we are
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of who's supposed to be in it
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%

04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
this point the only people that would
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
qualify as legal in this country are
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
green card holders refugees and anyone
 
04:21:55.149 --> 04:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
with an up to date Visa the people who
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
are not here legally for whatever reason
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
are the Asylum Seekers who used the CBP
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
p app over the past four years they have
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
not been vetted they have not been put
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
through into Pole to see if they are in
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
fact wanted criminals they have not been
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
petitioned by the United States
 
04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
government to their country of origin to
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
see what their criminal backgrounds are
 
04:22:22.109 --> 04:22:22.119 align:start position:0%
they have not been medically cleared
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses those individuals it
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
does not address or prevent Refuge
 
04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
housing legal aliens anybody with a
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
valid Visa or a green card we have seen
 
04:22:39.149 --> 04:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
instances in Massachusetts and New York
 
04:22:43.149 --> 04:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
and I personally saw in instance Logan
 
04:22:45.670 --> 04:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
Airport last year at the international
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
terminal they had it Cordon doed there
 
04:22:48.399 --> 04:22:49.790 align:start position:0%
terminal they had it Cordon doed there
was

04:22:49.790 --> 04:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
500 Asylum Seekers behind a petition in
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
the international terminal of Boston
 
04:22:58.910 --> 04:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
Logan Airport now you tell me how safe
 
04:23:01.149 --> 04:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
anybody would feel in that situation you
 
04:23:03.550 --> 04:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
want to put someone who's not been
 
04:23:04.990 --> 04:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
vetted through the United States
 
04:23:07.229 --> 04:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
government for whatever reason into our
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
Public Schools even if the children
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
aren't there you are exposing them to
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
potential crimes potential diseases
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
potential viruses so this bill is more
 
04:23:21.950 --> 04:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
of a proactive instead of a reactive
 
04:23:25.109 --> 04:23:25.119 align:start position:0%
situation so we aren't faced with making
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
that decision they had an instance in
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
Roxberry Massachusetts with the mayor of
 
04:23:33.790 --> 04:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
Boston put all of these Asylum seekers
 
04:23:36.109 --> 04:23:36.119 align:start position:0%
in the only Community Center they had in
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
rockberry that is an impoverished pot of
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
Boston that is loaded with minorities
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
those parents were absolutely wild they
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
took the only source of community away
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
from their children in the inner city we
 
04:23:54.830 --> 04:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
want to prevent that this is what this
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
you repr
 
04:24:04.030 --> 04:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
SEL with all due respect to quote the
 
04:24:05.309 --> 04:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
current governor we are not
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the things that are
 
04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
happening in Massachusetts and the
 
04:24:09.109 --> 04:24:09.119 align:start position:0%
things that are happening in New
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are different this bill in my
 
04:24:13.870 --> 04:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
opinion is an offensive bill I would
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
never support something like this I
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
think we need to recognize that people
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
who have come here by whatever means
 
04:24:20.830 --> 04:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
they have come here are generally
 
04:24:22.750 --> 04:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
fleeing from situations that are dire
 
04:24:24.670 --> 04:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
and desperate and if we're so concerned
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
about diseases we should not be working
 
04:24:28.189 --> 04:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
on other bills that take away the
 
04:24:29.830 --> 04:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
ability for people to get inoculations
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
and vaccinations and we should be
 
04:24:33.030 --> 04:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
requiring anyone who walks into any
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:36.399 --> 04:24:38.590 align:start position:0%
 
vaccinated

04:24:38.590 --> 04:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
04:24:40.870 --> 04:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
hear uh representative Morris did you
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
have another comment it yes this is in
 
04:24:44.590 --> 04:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
regards to a situation that happened to
 
04:24:46.189 --> 04:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
me a few months ago from an illegal
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
alien when I was actually assaulted and
 
04:24:50.070 --> 04:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
attacked from someone who did not obey
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
our laws because they didn't know what
 
04:24:53.309 --> 04:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
our laws were I was down in South
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
Carolina yeah I know it's not New
 
04:24:57.309 --> 04:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I was helping with Storm
 
04:24:59.550 --> 04:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
Restoration from the hurricane we had
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
and there was an legal who was drunk
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
driving got into a hit- and run accident
 
04:25:05.229 --> 04:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
and then took off I was on the train
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
tracks trying to help an 18 wheeler get
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
through before a train was coming so I
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
was kind of
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
preoccupied it was a long story um
 
04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
the guy in the vehicle came back and I
 
04:25:16.349 --> 04:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
took his keys out of his ignition
 
04:25:18.750 --> 04:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
because he was definitely drunk um he
 
04:25:20.149 --> 04:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't speak English we were trying to
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
get a translator app open and he
 
04:25:24.269 --> 04:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
proceeded to assault me and I had to
 
04:25:26.670 --> 04:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
defend myself against him um these are
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
the type of people that are coming into
 
04:25:29.790 --> 04:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
the country they don't have a law book
 
04:25:31.870 --> 04:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
that they go by they're not raised here
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
they don't know what's legal and what's
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
not therefore they don't abide by it so
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
if we allow these people into our
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
schools community centers or whatever
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
else we're subjecting our society to
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
really anything I mean they could be
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
putting cameras in the girls bathrooms
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the capabilities are
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
but the options are endless so yeah as
 
04:25:53.109 --> 04:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
to the point preventative let's make
 
04:25:54.910 --> 04:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we can keep our communities
 
04:25:58.269 --> 04:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
safe as our top
 
04:26:00.750 --> 04:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
priority representative
 
04:26:04.349 --> 04:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr
 
04:26:07.109 --> 04:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
chair with respect to the different
 
04:26:09.070 --> 04:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
scenarios that are being reported in
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
other parts of the US
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
and particularly representative Morris
 
04:26:18.670 --> 04:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate South Carolina
 
04:26:20.830 --> 04:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
experience none of these are things that
 
04:26:24.149 --> 04:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
Americans don't also do so the idea that
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
we are blaming
 
04:26:28.510 --> 04:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
immigrants for drunk driving and
 
04:26:32.910 --> 04:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
assault as if they are somehow
 
04:26:35.790 --> 04:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
different is
 
04:26:35.800 --> 04:26:40.590 align:start position:0%
different is
extremely

04:26:40.590 --> 04:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.590 --> 04:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
oh yes I'm going back to the term
 
04:26:49.870 --> 04:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
specified aliens according to the New
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um uh Health and Human
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
Services office uh that term is not
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
defined and they use the closest match
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
and when they were describing the the
 
04:27:05.109 --> 04:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
financial impact of the bill which is
 
04:27:08.309 --> 04:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
the word alien What refers to any person
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
who is not a US citizen or national and
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
because of that that it can be assumed
 
04:27:16.030 --> 04:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
that it would include all
 
04:27:19.950 --> 04:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
non-citizens this bill doesn't specify
 
04:27:23.229 --> 04:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't include people with
 
04:27:31.710 --> 04:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:35.229 --> 04:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
refugees thank you representative Harvey
 
04:27:38.189 --> 04:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
bolia thank you Mr chair
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
I the bill is um yes it that is true
 
04:27:47.109 --> 04:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
that is not um specified in that way but
 
04:27:50.550 --> 04:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
the refugees have a refugee program that
 
04:27:53.149 --> 04:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
is some of the documentation I gave you
 
04:27:55.109 --> 04:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
the office of refugee and
 
04:27:57.870 --> 04:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
resettlement that's where the refugees
 
04:28:01.109 --> 04:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
go for housing and they have programs in
 
04:28:03.109 --> 04:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
pretty much every state is my
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
understanding uh the the Genesis of the
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
bill is to keep the schools for the
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
students um and to protect that
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable popul pop ation of the
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
students where we've seen a lot of
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
encroachments um we've lived through
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
covid when they close the schools and we
 
04:28:23.309 --> 04:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to close the schools again
 
04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that that is mean
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:36.870 --> 04:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
you repres Corell for other than the
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
fact that this is a mean bill um the
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services did say say
 
04:28:46.349 --> 04:28:46.359 align:start position:0%
that because of the different um things
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
04:28:52.109 --> 04:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
be acting against that Government
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
funding could be withheld and it could
 
04:28:57.389 --> 04:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
be 12 to 18 million per year and they
 
04:29:00.109 --> 04:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
also said that according to rules you
 
04:29:03.950 --> 04:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
can no longer say um indeterminable that
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
cannot be used as an excuse anymore no
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
matter what um former commissioner
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
Steven said who's been out for about 20
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
years um so we could lose 12 to18
 
04:29:19.349 --> 04:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
million a year in a year when our budget
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
is not in good shape and my second point
 
04:29:24.990 --> 04:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
would be that it prohibits the use of
 
04:29:27.229 --> 04:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
public schools it doesn't say public
 
04:29:29.790 --> 04:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools which you know has to be
 
04:29:34.030 --> 04:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
included um because of the statute if
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
you don't mention them they aren't
 
04:29:38.830 --> 04:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
counted so our public charter schools
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
could be used um if if the word worst
 
04:29:44.109 --> 04:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
case scenario happened and we had to
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
house somebody so they would all go to
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.070 --> 04:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
you sure um represent Terry yeah with
 
04:29:54.830 --> 04:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
respect to the fiscal note and the loss
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
of federal funds um I I I would like to
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh point to the current reality that we
 
04:30:04.269 --> 04:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
actually are now beginning to see more
 
04:30:06.269 --> 04:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
people leaving the country than coming
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
into the country so I I don't I'm not
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
quite sure uh upon what premise this
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was developed but the
 
04:30:17.309 --> 04:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
situation has uh changed markedly since
 
04:30:19.149 --> 04:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
January 20th thank
 
04:30:22.349 --> 04:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
you I would just note um there was an
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
article in uh NH
 
04:30:31.109 --> 04:30:31.119 align:start position:0%
nhpr um see the date uh January 23rd um
 
04:30:35.229 --> 04:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
of this year about um flights of
 
04:30:37.950 --> 04:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
refugees headed to New Hampshire um were
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
cancelled after the president's um
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
executive order um we will not know what
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
will happen in the future um there could
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
be uh legal action um related to that uh
 
04:30:56.189 --> 04:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
executive order uh so um so I I will
 
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
support um the motion any further
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Bon yes um
 
04:31:05.710 --> 04:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh what what you're saying is
 
04:31:07.510 --> 04:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
something that's in the future what what
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
a what the Health and Human Services
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
have said to us is that's the funing
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
that they are currently receiving it's
 
04:31:17.109 --> 04:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
unclear I mean I think you're making an
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
assumption that the refugees that we
 
04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
currently have are somehow not going to
 
04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
be here anymore because this money is
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
going towards them and with regards to
 
04:31:28.830 --> 04:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
another comment that was made about uh
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
the housing being available for refugees
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
sure they have as part of the program
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
housing but the same as you and I if
 
04:31:37.109 --> 04:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
there is an emergency in our houses and
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have to seek shelter why wouldn't
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
they be in the same boat as the rest of
 
04:31:44.189 --> 04:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%

Freeman thank you Mr chair and I this
 
04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
this will be my last comment I pulled
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
this right up out of USCIS law so any
 
04:31:56.510 --> 04:31:56.520 align:start position:0%

that is the definition of an alien a
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
refugee is not a definition of an alien
 
04:32:27.790 --> 04:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
a legal alien is not definition of an
 
04:32:30.349 --> 04:32:30.359 align:start position:0%

04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%

representative

04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
McDonald um would the maker like to uh
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
speak to her
 
04:35:21.029 --> 04:35:21.039 align:start position:0%
motion yes I just want to say that I
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
have heard the term evidence-based a lot
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the last two years I like the fact
 
04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
that it's being addressed and that's why
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
this uh representative any comment yeah
 
04:35:34.029 --> 04:35:34.039 align:start position:0%
to say it briefly I like this bill
 
04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
because it incorporates a scientific
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
method into the education system with
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
the concept of
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
falsifiability and then just finally it
 
04:35:43.709 --> 04:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent anyone from using
 
04:35:46.230 --> 04:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
surveys or conducting surveys just that
 
04:35:48.269 --> 04:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
that has to be declared as self-reported
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
data as opposed to evidence based by
 
04:35:50.080 --> 04:35:51.789 align:start position:0%
data as opposed to evidence based by
this

04:35:51.789 --> 04:35:51.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:35:54.310 --> 04:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
definition thank you further discussion
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
anybody representative Woodcock thank
 
04:36:00.029 --> 04:36:00.039 align:start position:0%
you chair Kelli just um surprisingly
 
04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
enough I won't be agreeing with that um
 
04:36:04.590 --> 04:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
my my think my thinking is a couple
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
things the first is um I understand
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
representative uh process for this but
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that we this eliminates
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
the chance for improvement in pedagogy
 
04:36:19.150 --> 04:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
by uh new Innovative attempts because
 
04:36:21.990 --> 04:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
they may not have a whole record of Base
 
04:36:23.629 --> 04:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to go forward in my
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
mind in education over the years if we
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
didn't continue to relook and reimo
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in technology we didn't relook
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
reimo and gets better every day I mean
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
so to say nope we're going to stay right
 
04:36:36.750 --> 04:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
here we are at 2025 and call it a day um
 
04:36:39.551 --> 04:36:39.561 align:start position:0%
and you know the i find I find that um
 
04:36:41.709 --> 04:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of Education or
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
students and I'm not suggesting the
 
04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
content that the content the way the
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
content is defined is one thing but this
 
04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
is pedagogue is how do we teach this
 
04:36:52.670 --> 04:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's the H from ballpark I think
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
you're limiting teachers and their
 
04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
ability to be professional instructors
 
04:37:00.510 --> 04:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative C
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I I agree um with
 
04:37:04.869 --> 04:37:04.879 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock that my concern
 
04:37:07.990 --> 04:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
with this is that it it blocks the
 
04:37:08.000 --> 04:37:09.029 align:start position:0%
with this is that it it blocks the
ability

04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
ability
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
for um school districts to
 
04:37:14.189 --> 04:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
test out new teaching techniques that
 
04:37:16.750 --> 04:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
are being developed I think back to when
 
04:37:19.230 --> 04:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
I was teaching when laptops started
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
becoming or computers in general we had
 
04:37:24.189 --> 04:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
to go to a computer lab initially um and
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
then we got laptops that came to the
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
classroom on carts and that was all very
 
04:37:31.109 --> 04:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
new technology and very new strategies
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
when we started incorporating those
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
things into our teaching style and
 
04:37:36.670 --> 04:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
teaching students work processing as
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
part of their editing process and not
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
just pure editing by handing a written
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
copy that their friends had to decipher
 
04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
their handwriting which you know if
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
student was like me with disg graphia
 
04:37:48.390 --> 04:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
their handwriting was completely
 
04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
illegible um and so I I think about the
 
04:37:53.390 --> 04:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
ways and the speed with which our
 
04:37:56.029 --> 04:37:56.039 align:start position:0%
society is developing in the time since
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
we have added technology to our
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
classrooms things are changing faster
 
04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
than we can think them through and I
 
04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
just feel that this type of a bill
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
stifles the ability if we have to only
 
04:38:09.830 --> 04:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
use established practices we won't be
 
04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
able to develop new practices and so for
 
04:38:14.551 --> 04:38:14.561 align:start position:0%
that reason I can't support this Bill
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
B Bon uh yes I also will not be voting
 
04:38:22.109 --> 04:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
in favor of this there's something that
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
um my work as a member of the
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
professional development uh or what we
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
used to call Professional learning
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
communities in my school district um
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
relied a lot upon what we call Best
 
04:38:34.830 --> 04:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
Practices best practices are what
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
teachers are doing in the classroom and
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
they share those ideas if I'm in a group
 
04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
of fourth grade teachers and we are
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
teaching a unit um I rely on my peers to
 
04:38:49.310 --> 04:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
help um analyze what I'm doing in terms
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
of the way that I'm teaching but also
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
suggest things and that's what teacher
 
04:38:55.949 --> 04:38:55.959 align:start position:0%
mentors do this spill is interfering
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
with with the way that schools and um
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
professionals work with each other so I
 
04:39:04.109 --> 04:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
can't support this
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
spill thank you representative any
 
04:39:10.349 --> 04:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
