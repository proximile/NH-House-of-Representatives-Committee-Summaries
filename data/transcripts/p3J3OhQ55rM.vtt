and it's liable to go quickly which is a
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.310 align:start position:0%

and
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
we're making some some hard decisions
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
rather than just listening
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the hearing mode we're going to make
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
some hard decisions

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
about the amendment
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
it starts with number four on line nine
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking for that on the bill
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
and i see that number four is the
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
effective date so is this is this number
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
four to replace that and
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
just not quite sure where this amendment
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good question does anybody have
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on that rich
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
representative lasallus
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
yes just above that if you look above it
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
it says amend a bill by inserting after
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
section 3
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
the following and renumbering the
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
original section 4 to read his 5. got it
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that we had had was
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
the one year
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
residency has that not changed
 
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.389 align:start position:0%
residency has that not changed
uh

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
i believe it's been it has been changed
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
from five years to one year
 
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.590 align:start position:0%
from five years to one year
okay

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing the changing it from five
 
00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:45.189 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing the changing it from five
or

00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the part about it changing
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
from five years to one year that was in
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
the original bill correct and then the
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't do anything to address
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
that so it would just
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
stay as being reduced from five years to
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
one year
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um my recollection
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
was there are three bills that are all
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
tax credit ones yes and my
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
notes says is there a way to
 
00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
notes says is there a way to
uh

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
connect or combine that three
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
and also for fiscal note on three for
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
the impact
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
so any
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
update on that
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
no the right now the way we've set them
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
up is we're gonna have to take each
 
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.590 align:start position:0%
up is we're gonna have to take each
individually

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
individually
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe they're all ch they're all
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
have are going to be proposed to be
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
changed from a a longer time period to a
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
shorter time period all the same
 
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.470 align:start position:0%
shorter time period all the same
and

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
in our discussion we can
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
certainly uh advocate one versus the
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
other you know staying at five going to
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
one year whatever how how you feel
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
about that but we're not they're not
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
linked together
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
and uh further yes clarification how
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
about the fiscal note for
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
this the impact
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
i want to ask the clerk to make a note
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
of that i i believe
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's not required but we'll make a
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh when we first considered
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
i think part of our discussion was the
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
fact that many municipalities or
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the
 
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the
flexibility

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh at this point uh that they can do
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
essentially what this bill is asking for
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
and i think a large part of our
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
objection was that residential or that
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
the residency requirement
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh which i do think we'll have
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
discussions and other amendments that we
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
have coming up here which changed it to
 
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.350 align:start position:0%
have coming up here which changed it to
three

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
um i still think that i am i i see some
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
improvement with this amendment but the
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
fact that it doesn't change the
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
residency requirement or changes it to
 
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.789 align:start position:0%
residency requirement or changes it to
one

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh gives me cause to to vote against
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
this given that in part of the testimony
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
that the uh sponsor of the bill thought
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
even three was arbitrary so if three was
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
arbitrary but is the standard then one
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
seems even more arbitrary because
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's no basis
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm inclined to vote against the
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um given that municipalities
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
will still have the right to do
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
is trying to allow them to do thank you
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
any other comment about go ahead
 
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.029 align:start position:0%
any other comment about go ahead
uh

00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
i believe this is uh not a tax credit
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is a tax exemption so the the
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
large as uh
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
a tax credit would be so good
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
any other comments on 1055 yes
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative plea
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
my only concern is that
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
while this is just a tax credit every
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
dollar that we save from any single
 
00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:24.549 align:start position:0%
dollar that we save from any single
group

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
gets passed on to other groups
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that knowing all these
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
bills that are coming forward we're
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
heading down a slippery slope i can tell
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
you that i am
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
i was on a committee last session
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
not last year
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
as the chair of
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
state fed
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
relations and and veterans affairs and
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
we had a veterans bill
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
that was similar to um that particular
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
was a credit i agree but we've been
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
doing year after year we continue to do
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
these things and my concern is that we
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
really are passing the burden on to
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
someone else whether it be by
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
reducing their tax liability
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
through a credit or through reducing
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
their assessed value
 
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.789 align:start position:0%
their assessed value
um

00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
we keep saying we want to get more and
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
more young people into our
 
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.270 align:start position:0%
more young people into our
state

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
and we're doing everything we can to
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
stop that by happening by adding to
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
their real estate burden so
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
for that reason i
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
while i feel guilty saying no to this i
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
think i'm going to have to uh
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
pass thank you representative manjuputi
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you know having
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
this population for over 30 years as a
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
therapist and seeing how
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
their lives are impacted
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
one year residency
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
is too short for somebody
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
in this predicament where you know
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
they're trying to figure out where they
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
get the services where they can settle
 
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.510 align:start position:0%
get the services where they can settle
down

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.390 align:start position:0%
down
and

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
if they have to keep moving from one
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
community to the other and also
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of effort
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
so one year just giving one year
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
residency requirement that gives them a
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
false hope of being able to apply for
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
something and by the time they're able
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
to get that it may not be the community
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
that they want to uh be in so
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
you know it takes a little more and i am
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
all for supporting
 
00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:36.710 align:start position:0%
all for supporting
this

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
but i think the time frame and the way
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's worded
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
is not really beneficial to this
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
group very group we are trying to help
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
and with that i will vote against this
 
00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.070 align:start position:0%
and with that i will vote against this
okay

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder we are voting on the
 
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder we are voting on the
amendment

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
for hb 1055 which is an exemption for
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
the blind
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i apologize this
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
may not be germane to the amendment but
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
i just noticed something that i didn't
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
notice before
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
which makes me question
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
some technical aspects of how this bill
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
or might not be enforced which is the
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
communities typically only
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.029 align:start position:0%
 
therefore

00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
somebody who's lived in a property for
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
one year or even three years
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
it would be difficult if not impossible
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
and it might cause a tremendous amount
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
of work for assessors
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
in towns and cities to go back and
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
figure out well what is the true value
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
of this residence
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
right the the uh as i understand it the
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
towns are required
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
reevaluate every minimum every five
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
years but they can do it more frequently
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
if asked to or if they see market forces
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
or someone puts in a request for an
 
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.269 align:start position:0%
or someone puts in a request for an
abatement

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
abatement
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
i realize that i just pointed out as a
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
could be a a source of a problem for the
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
bill and and and because of those
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
technical problems and because of the
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
downshifting of property taxes
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
that some people may not have to pay
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
should this bill passes those will get
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
downshifted to other people in the
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
community i i will need to vote against
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%

00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
well i agree that uh the intent of this
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
is very good it's time to raise the
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
exemption for
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
people in need um i do have a problem
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
with the one-year
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
am also concerned about the downshift of
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
the cost to people the very people that
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
we're trying to attract to the state
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%

representative

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that my colleague
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
to my right
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned and also having worked with
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
this group
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
i know this is a very well intended but
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
it's going to create a lot more
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
confusion and
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh mis
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
wrong expectation
 
00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:37.990 align:start position:0%
wrong expectation
of

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
people who are moving in families with
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh individuals with disability who are
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
moving into the state
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
will have
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
with uh you know discrepancy between one
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
year five-year assessment and tax credit
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
or tax
 
00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.149 align:start position:0%
or tax
um

00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
exemption so i think there'll be more
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
confusion more
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
issue with the process so with that i
 
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.350 align:start position:0%
issue with the process so with that i
would

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
vote against it
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
and hope that next term will have a
 
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.630 align:start position:0%
and hope that next term will have a
better

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%

an amendment to
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
isn't there an amendment to 1055
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
not 1056. uh if there is i don't have

not 1056. uh if there is i don't have
one

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
so 0498 was to 10.55
 
00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:05.669 align:start position:0%
so 0498 was to 10.55
yes

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
zero one three nine eight
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
so zero four nine eight which says it
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
was to ten fifty five is not in that
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
applicable here that was another
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that went with
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
ten fifty five okay
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
okay so we're back to uh representative
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
mcdonald just made a motion to
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
otp for
 
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.190 align:start position:0%
otp for
bill

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
president lasallus makes a second
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative please thank you
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
once again i
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
putting the minimums and the maximums
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
the issue here is those
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
um towns or cities that have the um
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
50 minimum
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
now will have to push it up to 200 and
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to have an effect on them
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
personally the town that i come from
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
this will not have an effect on
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
but we're also pushing the 750 up to 900
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
which does put pressure from
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities to municipalities
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
and once again i just feel that we're
 
00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:24.870 align:start position:0%
and once again i just feel that we're
just

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
passing the burden on
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm and i'm quite concerned
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
who is going to be taking this in the
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
end so thank you
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative manjuputi
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
i you know my concern
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
adding to representative please is um
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
smaller communities are going to share
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
the burden
 
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.430 align:start position:0%
the burden
and

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
larger cities uh like ours
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
that i come from
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
already provides a lot of
 
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.909 align:start position:0%
already provides a lot of
support

00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
but it will affect the high end
 
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:03.190 align:start position:0%
but it will affect the high end
um

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
where it goes from 750 to 900
 
00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:08.310 align:start position:0%
where it goes from 750 to 900
and

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know with that
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
i will have a harder time
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh supporting it and i do understand
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
this will have
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know if the current thing exists and
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
more uh female veterans
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
are able to enroll in the existing
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
current one
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
and this then there's an even
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
distribution of uh veterans across the
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
state with all the communities share it
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
helpful so um
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
i would uh not be able to support it
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out that this is an
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
enabling bill
 
00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.909 align:start position:0%
enabling bill
and

00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
the towns that are
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
interested in providing the tax credit
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
can do so if they want
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
i do agree that
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum is being increased from
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars to two hundred dollars but
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh as was presented during the testimony
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh the fifty dollars is from the civil
 
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.069 align:start position:0%
uh the fifty dollars is from the civil
war

00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
war
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think it might be time to increase the
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
the minimum to uh something that's a
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
little more uh 2000-ish so uh
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
with that in mind i
 
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.510 align:start position:0%
with that in mind i
will

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill thank you very much
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm gonna
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
i think we'll be hearing this a few
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
times but
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
i agree that something from the civil
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
war should probably be updated but with
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
that should have the fiscal analysis
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
that shows us what the impact is going
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
with all due respect this bill should
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
have had a fiscal note to it
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
we understand the process that that
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
would have to go through but when we
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
have to think about the impact that this
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
will have or could have
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
those of us familiar with municipal
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
budgeting we always have to budget for
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario and i don't consider
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
this worst case but you have to consider
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
what will the impact be
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
statewide since we're thinking about
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
this and and we could have done that you
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
know that homework is possible to do for
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
dra which is why if we can do it i think
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
this should have had a fiscal note to it
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
so if somebody asked me what's the
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
impact i could say i don't know
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
and i and i can't go back to people and
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
say i don't know when i know the
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
information was available so i have to
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
um another question mr chair you know we
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
all heard the governor's state of the
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
state and uh if there's a huge
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
veterans campus being
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
raised in
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
franklin 100 million dollars
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
and uh this would be a good opportunity
 
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.829 align:start position:0%
and uh this would be a good opportunity
for

00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
town of franklin to look at how it's
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to impact or how it benefits and
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know seems like that would be a
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
great opportunity to look at how that
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
pans out before we make a statewide
 
00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:07.829 align:start position:0%
pans out before we make a statewide
change

00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
i hate to repeat myself but once again
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is an enabling bill
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
i i think since it is an enabling bill
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
and it can be uh
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
enabled at different values since uh the
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
value is changing from 750 to 900
 
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
value is changing from 750 to 900
uh

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
it it's there's going to be variation uh
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
since it is once again an enabling bill
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
not every town will
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
adopt it it's an interesting thought
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
that you could uh
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
produce a fiscal note for this but
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's a number of unknown variables
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
here which would make it very difficult
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
difficult for it to be anywhere accurate
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
yeah let me add in that i know in my
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
the way that the
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
governing body is implementing these
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
things is
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
as they look at the
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
financial ability to absorb this cost
 
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.510 align:start position:0%
financial ability to absorb this cost
they're

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
taking these
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
tax credits up by 50 a year
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
to kind of phase it in as opposed to uh
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
take it all at once
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative i think
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative clee and mr chair
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
um my understanding from the clerk
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that if
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
a committee wishes to see a fiscal note
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
that is a matter that can be voted upon
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
at the executive session
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
you're very that's very true
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
therefore what i'm proposing for your
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
consideration since we have a raft of
 
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
consideration since we have a raft of
bills

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
to exec today that deal with the
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
specific issue of tax exemptions and tax
 
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.470 align:start position:0%
specific issue of tax exemptions and tax
credits

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
credits
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we consider taking a vote on
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
whether these particular bills require
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes in order for us to
 
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.710 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes in order for us to
responsibly

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
responsibly
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
cast a vote in support or not of them
 
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:30.230 align:start position:0%
cast a vote in support or not of them
okay

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but this
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation that would have
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
to be passed by a town
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
through in the case of in my case a
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
warrant article
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
so the impact the fiscal impact on the
 
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.470 align:start position:0%
so the impact the fiscal impact on the
state

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
would would not
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
there would be no fiscal impact on the
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
state it would be on the individual town
 
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.990 align:start position:0%
state it would be on the individual town
correct

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.589 align:start position:0%
correct
correct

00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair was there someone
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
in front of me
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
two things this this is
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
is in fact enabling legislation however
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
those that already have it
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
must abide by this or they're going to
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
have to repeal
 
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.430 align:start position:0%
have to repeal
this

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
these credits they would actually have
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
to take them away
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
or they're going to have to abide by
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
going from 50
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
dollars to 200
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's also another
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
um added thing in here that
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
um the the term not less than 90 days
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
on active service has been struck
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
truly take a whole lot of individuals
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
that would fall into that category but
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
that also does add to the the numbers
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
that would um
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
would qualify for the uh for the credit
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
but as as enabling
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
we we talk about that the community has
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
to vote in order to have it however if
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
they've already have it
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
then they have to go from
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
they have no choice in it they have to
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
go from the 50 to the 200.
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
their choice is going to be we stop it
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
as far as a fiscal note is it would be a
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note local so it would be an fnl
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
not a just a regular fiscal note
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
because it does affect
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
the truth is it doesn't affect the
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities per se but it affects the
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers within the municipality as
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
they have to pick up the burden
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
so for instance the city of nashua or
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack and so on they're
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
not going to be their budgets aren't
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
going to be affected but their residents
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
will be affected by this so thank you
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um representative
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
klee made the point to that that i was
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
raising my hand to make and that is
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
while this is in fact enabling
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
legislation there are municipalities
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
who have which have already adopted this
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
so if this were to pass then this would
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
they would have to abide by it
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
by the the
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal
 
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.150 align:start position:0%
the fiscal
changes

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.030 align:start position:0%
changes
okay

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
stavis do you want to
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
have another whack at this
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
um could i make a motion microphone
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
well would it be an order to make a
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
motion to request a fiscal note
 
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:51.430 align:start position:0%
motion to request a fiscal note
um

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
i think we need to uh
 
00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:54.150 align:start position:0%
i think we need to uh
dis

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
dis
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
disposition the motion we have and then
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
yes um would it be in order for the this
 
00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:24.950 align:start position:0%
yes um would it be in order for the this
current

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
motion on the table be withdrawn then
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
the other motion can be made any motion
 
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
can be withdrawn okay
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i mean if we do vote on the
 
00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:36.790 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i mean if we do vote on the
motion

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
on the tape table on the bill in other
 
00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:40.230 align:start position:0%
on the tape table on the bill in other
words

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.349 align:start position:0%
words
then

00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
the need for a fiscal note would be moot
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't have the information
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to allow is that if the
 
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to allow is that if the
motion

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
passes then i'm going to open the floor
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
up to see if anybody wants to make a
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
motion to add a fiscal note to any of
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.750 align:start position:0%
these bills
and

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
that has the
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
power to do that
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
where we are yes where is representative
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
my challenge is that my vote on on this
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
bill would be dependent on the fiscal
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
note if there is a a
 
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.750 align:start position:0%
note if there is a a
large

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
in my opinion a large
 
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.030 align:start position:0%
in my opinion a large
tax

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
hit that property tax owners in towns
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
would have to take for this that would
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
influence my vote
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
so it's difficult to to vote otp without
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
having an understanding of the tax
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
implications for the communities that
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
already have this credit i understand
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
but we're in the voting mode now so it's
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
trip

00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
trip
 
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.750 align:start position:0%
trip
um

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
i was going to say that there
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:44:06.839 --> 00:44:08.630 align:start position:0%
would be
no

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
tax implication but
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it's primarily a tax shift
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
it being a tax credit but uh
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to withdraw that
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
statement because the the increase from
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
50 to two hundred dollars is a definite
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh tax impact so uh
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'm corrected thank you
 
00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:29.510 align:start position:0%
i'm corrected thank you
thanks

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking on the thank you mr
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
chair i'm looking you know as we did
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
before on dra there's a 33-page report
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
that that has all of the towns listed
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
with what they already have
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
this information is not hard to get i
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
would not want to be the one to be
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for saying this is the
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
impact it just seems that dra
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i don't know who makes those
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
decisions when the bills are are first
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
assigned but that's the information that
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
we that we are hoping to get from this
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
um may be negligible maybe you know
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
maybe completely negligible but there
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
will be a shall in this
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
i just we
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
hoping for as we've heard before full
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure so that we can be confident
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
in our decision so without the fiscal
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
note i'm going to vote against it's not
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
because i want to vote against the
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
veterans in any way shape or form but i
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
need to know that i've done my due
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
diligence thank you thank you i am
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
confident that because it's an enabling
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
the dra's position is going to be that
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal impact
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
because the town is going to have to
 
00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:36.230 align:start position:0%
because the town is going to have to
choose

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
to implement or not and if they choose
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
not to implement the zero
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
impact and it will be very difficult the
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
dra to calculate the financial impact if
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be as variable as
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
the warren article that appears in each
 
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.710 align:start position:0%
the warren article that appears in each
community

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman except for the fact
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
that towns which already have this tax
 
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.670 align:start position:0%
that towns which already have this tax
exemption

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
will be required to go to the larger sum
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
so while it is enabling it is also
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
compelling for towns that already have
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
the exemption
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
representatives davis
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i would just like to go back to um
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
the time when we
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
heard these bills
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i made a
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
special mention of the fact that none of
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
them had fiscal notes and i believe
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
the clerk made a note or said he would
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
make a note of that
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
and so i would again put forward a
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
motion that before we
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
make a decision
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
that has significant or maybe not
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
significant we just don't know
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on the state and or its
 
00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.309 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on the state and or its
taxpayers

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we have the information at hand to
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
help us make that decision
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
i i hear what you're saying but that
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
motion is not in order at this time
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative majipudi uh thank you
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
i have in my notes from that public
 
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.589 align:start position:0%
i have in my notes from that public
hearing

00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
48 communities out of 250 yard
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
communities are providing less than 200
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
dollar tax credit 17 communities offer
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
750 tax credit
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
just the two ex
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
ends of the bookends and this is from
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
the assassin of
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
hudson so this at least looking at this
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
is 65 communities are going to be
 
00:47:37.839 --> 00:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
is 65 communities are going to be
impacted

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know and it's
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
what percentage of it at least 20
 
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.710 align:start position:0%
what percentage of it at least 20
25

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the communities are
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
little more than at 25 of the
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
communities so knowing that these many
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
communities are going to be impacted
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
i you know
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
doing our due diligence i think having a
 
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.790 align:start position:0%
doing our due diligence i think having a
fiscal

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
note would help
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
me to make that decision saying that
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
i've done everything i can
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
understanding and voted on it and i
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
think we need to do our due diligence
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
from that i would request that that mr
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%

having the finance committee
 
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.790 align:start position:0%
having the finance committee
review

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%

i will make that motion mr chairman
 
00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
i will make that motion mr chairman
okay

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.390 align:start position:0%
okay
and

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh is there a second
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
um so just to clarify
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
um you said for any number of these
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
bills which of them specifically are we
 
00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:37.910 align:start position:0%
bills which of them specifically are we
requesting

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes for we're going to go back
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
to representative lasallus to see
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
when he's made his motion which what
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
does he want it to apply to
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
i i would think mr chairman that we
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
should take them up
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
00:51:03.599 --> 00:51:06.870 align:start position:0%
this particular
bill

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
to have a fiscal note on it
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then at the completion of each bill
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
to say whether we want a fiscal load or
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
not all right so so the motion as
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
clarified is uh on
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
the motion is to add a fiscal note
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
to alert the finance committee to review
 
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.589 align:start position:0%
to alert the finance committee to review
this

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
for financial impact of the communities
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative maturi thank you mr
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
chair i appreciate i certainly
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that that's the direction uh
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
that we want to go clearly we've heard
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
that i just i'm unclear on process
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
getting a fiscal note versus sending
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
this to a second committee for all
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
intent and purpose
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm not saying i'm against what we
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
want to do i just want to make sure
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing it the right way i and i
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
have no idea
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
so because this couldn't be a second
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee bill could it
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.359 --> 00:52:14.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
and to get that clarity too because we
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
might have the same question i think
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the same question on
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of other bills so whatever the
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
process is i think i think you might
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
have some support
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
why don't i do this why don't i take a
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
short recess and we'll get some clarity
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
on the process how's that sound right
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to be in uh
 
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.270 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to be in uh
uh

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
we had a motion
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
on uh 1056 and that motion passed right
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes okay so so we're at the point where
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh just on the calendar here we're at
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
the point where we was going to start
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
hb 1057 shortly
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime we're going to get
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
some process direction and so let's take
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know if it hasn't come through with
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
one already
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
too late gotta vote for it at the
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
executive session which is why i made my
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
motion right
 
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.309 align:start position:0%
motion right
um

00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
i don't think sending it to another
 
00:53:50.319 --> 00:53:52.309 align:start position:0%
i don't think sending it to another
committee

00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
is the way it's done i think it's we the
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
buck stops with us
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know we have the fiscal note or we
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
vote to request a fiscal note and then
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
we vote again on the bill based on the
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
information we have but i think
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
sending it to another so your thought is
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
paul's direction is that we would vote
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
in a fiscal note yeah while it's here
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then we revoke to decide whether we
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
ipl or otp to go with the physical note
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
yes it's up to us okay
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's easier that's easier than what i
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
was going to do yeah so that's i'm going
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
to call him and people are going to tell
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
me the same thing you want me to show
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
we've had that discussion and we're all
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
in that in that direction okay thank you
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure we are on the
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%

okay

00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%

this category if you're twenty-something
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
moving it around

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%

and this one was the tax exemption for
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
the disabled so it was three they were
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%

could do it for the record this time
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
what you want reconsidered and how you
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
want it to be reconsidered
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:15:28.159 --> 01:15:29.189 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
i would like to reconsider 1055
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
in order to give this committee time to
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
obtain a fiscal note which will give us
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
precise information or even ballpark
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
information on what kind of an impact
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
passing or not passing this bill might
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
have either on the state or on the
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
residents of the towns and
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
are forced or choose to adopt this
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
increase in tax exemptions and credits
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to clarify uh as i
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
hear you're you're asking the committee
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
to reconsider
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1055 as amended
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.470 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily i think we have to wait
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
until we get that information
 
01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.750 align:start position:0%
until we get that information
from

01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal we won't be waiting for
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
any of the fiscal notes what they what
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
happens in the process is the request
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
for fiscal notes goes to the speaker's
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
office and then they make a decision
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
whether to
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
get a fiscal note or not
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's different from what the clerk
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
told me
 
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.830 align:start position:0%
told me
but

01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think we've
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
already voted to reconsider that's the
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
vote that we just took right so now
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
we're obligated to vote again on 10 55
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
right the question is do we want to
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
bring another motion before
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
we consider the vote on 10 55 so we've
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
already agreed that we're going to talk
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
it over again
 
01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.350 align:start position:0%
it over again
um

01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
so that's right your recommendation is
 
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.470 align:start position:0%
so that's right your recommendation is
to

01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
my recommendation
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
no my recommendation is not otp my
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that we
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh request
 
01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh request
um

01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
more information about the shifting my
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's what about 55
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
yes 55 million 627 000
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be shifted from one citizen
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
group to another citizen group if all of
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
these bills that deal with exemptions
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
right my thought was that the motion
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
so procedural is that possible you
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
explained to us that otpa when we were
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
voting for woody pa the reason we voted
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
against that was because we didn't have
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note and you're safe
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no we are reconsidering but you're
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
saying we won't get it back so without
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
getting the fiscal note asking us to
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
vote for otpa
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense in my mind maybe
 
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of tunnel vision but just
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
explain to me
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
the other motion now that we have
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
reconsidered in a unanimous
 
01:18:34.159 --> 01:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
reconsidered in a unanimous
reconsideration

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
possible to have
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
um other motion now for example like
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
itl and when it gets to the floor if we
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note float amendment and then
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
overturn it
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
our request there a fiscal note
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
is a is a request
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
and that we're not going to get any
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
full with the full assembly
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't bounce back to us for us
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
to make a decision whether we agree or
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
not with the physical node or what what
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note makes us think of
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
that ours is an open recommendation to
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
the to the speaker
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
that this requires a fiscal note and he
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
can decide whether it does or not yeah
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair so it makes sense to
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
say you know pending fiscal note
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
we voted itl so if the fiscal note comes
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
in as a floor amendment
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
at the session then we have the full
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative matt jory
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm curious um if we have to
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
no we do not
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
could it
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
my follow-up then to that is so in order
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
to avoid the possibility or the the
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
potential of confu of additional
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
confusing about voting on on the
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
disposition of this bill
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
can we send that request
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
to the speaker's office if it is
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
approved we'll get the fiscal note if
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
it's denied we won't and then we can
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
dispose of the bill pending that
 
01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.910 align:start position:0%
dispose of the bill pending that
decision

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
at one of our other
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
we can we can try and see what they see
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
if they get back to us this is
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
unprecedented in my
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
me too and my uh tour here so i i'm not
 
01:20:38.719 --> 01:20:39.750 align:start position:0%
me too and my uh tour here so i i'm not
uh

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not telling you what's going to
 
01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not telling you what's going to
happen

01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
representatives davis i feel a little
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
bit back to the future here because i
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
think that was indeed my original motion
 
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.149 align:start position:0%
think that was indeed my original motion
um

01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
and and if i may mr chair just say a few
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
words about
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
this group of bills
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
i think that it is the responsible thing
 
01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:03.590 align:start position:0%
i think that it is the responsible thing
for

01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
this committee out of all committees to
 
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.270 align:start position:0%
this committee out of all committees to
do

01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
to very carefully weigh and measure the
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
potential impact
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the many many bills that come
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
before us requesting tax exemptions or
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
tax credits for special groups of people
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
over other groups of people
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't get considered here as a
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
matter of public policy for this state
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
it will not be considered anywhere and i
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
think we have a solemn obligation
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
to fully understand
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
the impact of shifting these dollars
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
from one group to another
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
when any bill comes before us that
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
requests an increase in existing tax
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
exemption or a new tax credit
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for letting me speak
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i see your hand up let me
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
suggest this that
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
rather than prolong this discussion
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest that
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
the motions we have on the floor be
 
01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.830 align:start position:0%
the motions we have on the floor be
withdrawn

01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
withdrawn
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.189 align:start position:0%
and that
you

01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
designate me to
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
go forward with the
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the committee wants
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
to see fiscal notes on these three bills
 
01:22:17.679 --> 01:22:18.629 align:start position:0%
to see fiscal notes on these three bills
and

01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
what what that means and we'll get some
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
output out of the speaker's office and
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
i'll bring it back to you tomorrow thank
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes mr chairman i just want to make
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
a point of order we had a vote to
 
01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:33.669 align:start position:0%
a point of order we had a vote to
reconsider

01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
the motion otpa
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
so we can suspend uh someone can
 
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.669 align:start position:0%
so we can suspend uh someone can
withdraw

01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
that motion the the otpa motion but
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's the the only course of action we
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
can do now in in my opinion you can
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
please correct me if i'm wrong is
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
to re-vote on otpa
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
as we are allowed under the the approved
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider or suspend
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
but if we come back or whoever made the
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
motion can withdraw it and the second
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
can be withdrawn but when we do
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
reconvene on this bill
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
our our order of business would be to
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
vote on re take a re-vote on otpa we
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
can't entertain another motion because
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
the only thing we're allowed to
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
reconsider is otpa
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
right but we can withdraw the motion
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
typically we only have four
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
four actions that we can take one is otp
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
one is itl
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
one is otpa
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the fourth one is interim study
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
those are our four options
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
so we're kind of
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
skirting around this a little bit and
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
just delaying it to try to get to
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
whether we want otp or itl this
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are uh yes
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
representative manchputi uh with the
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
reconsideration we can vote it up or
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
down right if we can the reconsideration
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
the motion is still on the table yeah so
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
we could say no so we are not
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
reconsidering and the otpa stays
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
on it what i'm suggesting is that
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
those who made the motion withdraw their
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
motion and it will start fresh tomorrow
 
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
with input that i get from the
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
speakers yes representative
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
we voted to reconsider
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
so now we're back at otpa
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that our choice is either
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
to vote again on otpa vote it down
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
get the fiscal notes
 
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.189 align:start position:0%
get the fiscal notes
and

01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
or could we table it i mean could we
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
table it and pick it up tomorrow the
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
tabling's not in order the tabling's not
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
in order
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
um because we have already voted to
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
i don't think so we we voted can we
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
recon can we withdraw a motion that
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
we've voted on we didn't vote yeah yeah
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
we did they
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we voted to reconsider we called
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know uh thank you mr chair i
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
know everybody's head is ready to
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
explode so
 
01:25:16.239 --> 01:25:17.110 align:start position:0%
explode so
um

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
what you've agreed to take on is to to
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
go forward and to find out what the uh
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is on it
 
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.669 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is on it
i

01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
if i'm not being out of line could i ask
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we ask what the
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of this is on the
 
01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.189 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of this is on the
taxpayers

01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
as was stated all of our
 
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.030 align:start position:0%
as was stated all of our
credits

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
um this the dra puts it on as taxes lost
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
when it's really not its taxes burden
 
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.270 align:start position:0%
when it's really not its taxes burden
shift

01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
shift
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
and 2020 was 55 million 627
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
496. so if we could get more of what the
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
impact is as if it's going to i don't
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
think we can but
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's on the dra report that's right so
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
if we had it formally for all of the
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
members rather than us each having to
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
look it up it would be wonderful thank
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
you okay representative van is correct
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we have voted to reconsider this
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
bill so i'm going to suggest that we
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
vote that down
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
and give and if you
 
01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.990 align:start position:0%
and give and if you
you

01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
get the chairman
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
wherever he might be to go find out
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
find out about the fiscal notes
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
so we're not in an in-between with some
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes and
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
some reconsideration i'm going to
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
suggest that we
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
we vote reconsideration down
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
and then we start fresh tomorrow with
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair i move to continue house bill
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
whichever one we're on
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
10 55
 
01:27:00.239 --> 01:27:03.270 align:start position:0%
10 55
to

01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh i think i need a motion to continue
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be to a date certain
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes so at the risk of not having all the
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
information i would move to
 
01:27:14.719 --> 01:27:15.990 align:start position:0%
information i would move to
continue

01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
until february 28th and keep my fingers
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
and toes crossed that we have something
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
with the risk that if we don't have it
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
why can't we move to continue yes yes
 
01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:36.629 align:start position:0%
why can't we move to continue yes yes
ma'am

01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
if i may make a friendly suggestion
 
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.149 align:start position:0%
if i may make a friendly suggestion
we

01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
we did certainly already vote
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
the the reconsider
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could just put this aside for
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
a minute call the house clerk and ask
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
him to come over
 
01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:51.830 align:start position:0%
him to come over
and

01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
explain exactly where we are in the
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
process and what exactly we need to do
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to move forward i don't think
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
that that would be out of line to just
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
put it
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
aside for a few minutes while he walks
 
01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.310 align:start position:0%
aside for a few minutes while he walks
over

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
from the tunnel and then we could move
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
on to other business while he's on his
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'd be happy to make that
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%

yes at the um
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
public hearing there was a question
 
01:30:54.639 --> 01:30:55.750 align:start position:0%
public hearing there was a question
whether

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
um we should just
 
01:30:57.679 --> 01:30:58.709 align:start position:0%
um we should just
strike

01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
strike
 
01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:00.070 align:start position:0%
strike
um

01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
just not just have it for any any
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
village district that wants to go from
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
three to five
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.629 align:start position:0%
because the
um

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
the current rsa
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
only limits that increase to the towns
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
of merrimack and hooksett
 
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
but there
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
there was an interest in increasing this
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
in another town
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
so my amendment
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
would um
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
allow any village district in the state
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
if they want to go from three to five
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
they can do so at their annual meeting
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then those additional
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
commissioners that would be added if the
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
town if the village district agreed to
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
issue whether
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%

01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%

all village districts to make that
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%

01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
on where we were with the uh with the
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note request
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
come join us paul with a little
 
01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:29.270 align:start position:0%
come join us paul with a little
conversation

01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
we have three
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation in front of us at
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
least three
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
where the committee is feeling like it
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh that there's enough fiscal impact
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
in their opinion that they like to
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
request fiscal notes for those three
 
01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.709 align:start position:0%
request fiscal notes for those three
bills

01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so we were kind of stuck on what the
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
process would be
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh good morning
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
so the situation is that
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
you can ask for a fiscal note um you
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
have to be in executive session and you
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
actually have to take a vote as a
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee to request of the legislative
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
budget assistance office a request for a
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note i would note however we are
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
now past the deadline for early bills
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
so even if you do ask for a fiscal note
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
in order to be assigned to a second
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
committee you will need to suspend any
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
house rules for action
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
so just be mindful of that
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
um that second committee has to suspend
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
the rules no the full house would have
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
if if
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
if a fiscal note is returned stating
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
that you uh
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
if it if it comes back showing it's
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
going to appropriate three million
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
dollars or something like that um then
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh in order to go to a second committee
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
which it would need to uh would require
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
a rule suspension to do that
 
01:38:04.239 --> 01:38:05.430 align:start position:0%
a rule suspension to do that
well

01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
the clerk is here we have questions for
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
him yes
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
mr clerk
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
the question that we have is that we
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
have a set of bills which change the tax
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
exemptions for various classes of
 
01:38:22.239 --> 01:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
exemptions for various classes of
persons

01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
persons
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the dras information it looks
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
to us as though this is going to
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
transfer the burden
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
in excess of 50 million dollars if they
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
all were to pass as now proposed
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
transfer something in the neighborhood
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
of 50 million dollars from one class of
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
persons to another class of persons we'd
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
like to know that it it doesn't affect
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
the state's budget
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
but it does affect individual taxpayers
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
and by extension
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
the towns and cities
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
so our question is how can we get that
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
information so that we can make an
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
informed decision and do i understand
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying is that at this
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
juncture we can no longer get that
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
information not at all um you could take
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
a vote as a committee to request a
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note i would note however when
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
these bills are reviewed and every bill
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
is reviewed by the speaker when they're
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
assigned um every bill
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
is determined at that point whether or
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
not it needs to go to a second committee
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
and historically based on
 
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
based on the text that's in front of you
 
01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:32.629 align:start position:0%
based on the text that's in front of you
now

01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
most of these bills these property tax
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
bills specifically
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't historically go to a second
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee which is why
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
they might not have been assigned us
 
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.229 align:start position:0%
they might not have been assigned us
previously

01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair no i understand why
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't go to a second committee
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to figure out is what
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
are we doing to the citizens sure by all
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
means as i mentioned the
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
getting a request for a fiscal note um
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
is is within your purview to do
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
i i have a procedural question we took a
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
vote on a bill
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended yes and
 
01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.189 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended yes and
it

01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
10 to 9
 
01:40:14.719 --> 01:40:15.669 align:start position:0%
10 to 9
and

01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
then the reconsideration
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
of that bill
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously so now we are sitting
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
at reconsideration
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
when we are looking at reconsideration
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
we either have to vote it down or
 
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.629 align:start position:0%
we either have to vote it down or
reinstate

01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
reinstate
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
otpa isn't that correct
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh no no so if you voted to reconsider
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
you are now at the last motion that was
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
acted on which is otpa
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
um that being said if this is one of
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
those bills that you're looking for that
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
information on um
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
the the chair can recess the executive
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
session on that particular
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation while you're
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
awaiting that
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
the result of the fiscal note
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up just a quick follow-up message
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
yeah so that means the reconsideration
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
can hold and that will stay as on the
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
table as we reconsider
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
because of the situation you're in
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
the recess
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
when you come back the motion is still
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
pending of ought to pass as amended
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative gallagher
 
01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.790 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative gallagher
so

01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
for the chair to
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
while we wait for
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note do we have to motion for
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
the chair to do that or is it just
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
entirely up to his own prerogative
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr clerk
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
i have a question about fiscal notes
 
01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:52.870 align:start position:0%
i have a question about fiscal notes
is

01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between us asking
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
dra for some information some
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know about the the tax implications
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
for this other class of persons
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
um is there a difference between that
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
and a formal fiscal note on a bill
 
01:42:10.239 --> 01:42:11.189 align:start position:0%
and a formal fiscal note on a bill
where

01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's a report from dra that list what
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts would be
 
01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:20.550 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts would be
yes

01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
the if you request a fiscal note that
 
01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
the if you request a fiscal note that
and

01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
the processes the legislative budget
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
assistance office
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
would then contact whichever agency
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for compiling that
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
information the agency would then
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
respond with whatever
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
whatever their estimates would be and
 
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
that would actually be physically
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
attached to the legislation
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
whereas if you requested
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
directly from dra right now and sent an
 
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
directly from dra right now and sent an
email

01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
and just said we're looking for this
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
information it would not be attached to
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
the actual piece of legislation however
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
you could certainly submit it such that
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
it it goes
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
um into the record for the the committee
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so there's really two
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
types like there's information financial
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
information we're getting on a tax
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
impact and then there's a formal fiscal
 
01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.390 align:start position:0%
impact and then there's a formal fiscal
note

01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
clark

01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
clark
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
following up on representative rung's
 
01:43:21.119 --> 01:43:22.070 align:start position:0%
following up on representative rung's
question

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
in the latter case when we're if we were
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
just to ask for information from dra
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
would we still then have to suspend
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
house rules
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
if if
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
if if the information that you receive
 
01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
if if the information that you receive
uh

01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
states that that they think that this is
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to require some sort of additional
 
01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.109 align:start position:0%
going to require some sort of additional
tax

01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
or appropriation
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
or a penalty or something along the
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
lines that would necessitate it to go to
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
a second committee
 
01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.830 align:start position:0%
a second committee
then

01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
but that's somewhat different than just
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
a reapportionment of taxes amongst
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
citizens that's correct right
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
so so in that in that case if that's the
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
specific information we seek
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
not you know how how much is this going
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
to make taxes go up
 
01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.590 align:start position:0%
to make taxes go up
but

01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
tax is going to be shifted from one
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
class of people to another class that
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
should not affect uh that should not
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
affect the problem a second committee
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.669 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
clerk

01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
um no ball tied today
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
the question i have kind of just for
 
01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.149 align:start position:0%
the question i have kind of just for
clarification

01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
in this case where there is no
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
burden to the the city the state the
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
town village district of any sort
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
going to the lba for a fiscal note
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're just going to come back with
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
zero because this is this affects the
 
01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:07.510 align:start position:0%
zero because this is this affects the
individual

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:08.950 align:start position:0%
individual
taxpayers

01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
and not that is
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
would you say that that to be correct i
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
could not say that because
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
even even if you um if you requested
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note they would likely do a
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
deep dive and try to come back with
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
something for you um
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
the at the end of the day
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
are not always about appropriations
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
they're not always about tax and fee
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
increases but there are significant
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
costs associated with various aspects of
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
government and
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
this committee actually gets several of
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
these fiscal notes every year where
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
where the fiscal note will state uh this
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
does transfer one you know
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
one tax base to another um
 
01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:57.109 align:start position:0%
one tax base to another um
but

01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
i i would tend to think that lba
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
would have suggested that right at the
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
beginning um through the process um
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
but again i i don't know the specifics
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr clerk as always your
 
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
your input has been very educational i
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking the time
 
01:46:16.639 --> 01:46:20.790 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking the time
thanks

01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
so with that input from
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
paul smith
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
we have these three bills
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
let's review what our options are we
 
01:46:38.719 --> 01:46:39.510 align:start position:0%
let's review what our options are we
have

01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
10 55 which we've already voted to to
 
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:45.669 align:start position:0%
10 55 which we've already voted to to
reconsider

01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
1056 and 1057 us are still pending what
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
we want to do with that
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
one of our options that we haven't
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
really spoken about yet is we could itl
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
all three of these bills if you're
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh with moving forward and what we may
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
or may not get back from
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
on a fiscal note
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
we're at 10 55 we have a motion to
 
01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:14.950 align:start position:0%
we're at 10 55 we have a motion to
reconsider

01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
saying we voted to reconsider
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
so at this point we're at
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
10 55 with a motion
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
to otp
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
so now the question is
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:36.149 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
may i speak to that motion yeah thank
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
recommend that we
 
01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.430 align:start position:0%
recommend that we
um

01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know the proper terminology but
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
basically that we vote no to otpa
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can take on another motion
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
the burden that all of these will have
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i know i'm supposed to speak to this
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
one particular one
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i apologize my notes here somewhere
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
but when we when we look at the total
 
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.350 align:start position:0%
but when we when we look at the total
burden

01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
burden
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
based on 2020
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
of the shift of taxes we're looking at
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
55 million 627 thousand dollars that we
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
are taking from one group of people to
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
another group of people just in these
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
three bills alone
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
a lot to ask for people when we keep
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
talking about workforce housing bringing
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
younger people in and so on
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
so i think that we do need to
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
turn this particular vote around so that
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
we can bring
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
another motion
 
01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.669 align:start position:0%
another motion
on

01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
and give
 
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
some equal benefits to all of them well
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
it it pains me it truly does pay me
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
to vote any of these down
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
because these are well-deserving groups
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
of people i fear what we're doing to the
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
alternate groups of people
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so i would like you to
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
consider voting no on the ought to pass
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
with the amendment thank you
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
and and let me go ahead representative
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have a question for
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative klee um when you got that
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
figure of 55 million can you describe
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
the process of how you
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
got to that number
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you thank you sir sure um
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
i have it right in front of me here
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
if you go to the dra website
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
and you look at each of the individual
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
reports the very last
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
column in the bottom will tell you what
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
the statewide
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
tax loss is you can actually when you
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
pull up the alpha you can see by
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
community and that is if i just bring
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
this up correctly so for instance the
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
one that i have right in front of me
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
is the veterans exemption and tax
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
credits they don't refer to that one as
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
taxes lost they actually refer to that
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
one as the credits because that's an
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
obvious taxes loss would be more for
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
those that were doing the
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
um exemptions
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
so in this particular one i bring it up
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's 2020
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i go all the way down to the very
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
very bottom of that report it says
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
statewide totals
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
31 million 775
 
01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:14.790 align:start position:0%
31 million 775
637

01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
637
 
01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.149 align:start position:0%
637
000

01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
in tax shift is the best way i can refer
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
to it as but they refer to the total
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
amount of tax
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
credits granted if i went over to
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
let's see the
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is the
 
01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.550 align:start position:0%
i think this is the
um

01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
the elderly and i would look at that the
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
very last column towards the bottom is
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
called taxes lost and if i look at the
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
very very bottom
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
i will see that it was 23 million 228
 
01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.390 align:start position:0%
i will see that it was 23 million 228
727

01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
727
 
01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.350 align:start position:0%
727
000

01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
of tax shift or tax loss as they refer
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
to it
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
each one of these has their alpha
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
if you just were to google new hampshire
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions and credits it will come
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
up and you can find it that way
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
and then it gives it in
 
01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.350 align:start position:0%
and then it gives it in
county

01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
it gives it in
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
alpha you can get in a spreadsheet or
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
you can get in a pdf form
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair would i be correct in
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
stating that the the numbers that
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative klee just shared from the
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
dra website
 
01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.550 align:start position:0%
dra website
that

01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
in fact the numbers would be higher
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that this bill is
 
01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:32.709 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that this bill is
proposing

01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
higher numbers
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure if they'd be higher or
 
01:51:37.599 --> 01:51:41.669 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure if they'd be higher or
lower

01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes i do they they would in fact be be
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
higher because more people would fall
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
into those categories
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
um and those so for instance if we were
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
just to take something like the veterans
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
one where we're changing from 50 to 200
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
all those communities ahead 50 as long
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
as they maintain it they're going to be
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
giving more money so yes these numbers
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
will in fact go up and be higher elderly
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
credit if we take into 60
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
into consideration versus 65 as it
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
stands now we're adding more people to
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
that group so yes in fact it will go up
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
state for my own understanding and
 
01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.189 align:start position:0%
state for my own understanding and
possibly

01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
for others as well that
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
as it was previously mentioned
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
towns and cities are already able to
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
grant these exemptions
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
and many many of them already do
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
and so if we were to vote itl on this
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration motion it would not be
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
like we were taking
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
any exemption or credit away from anyone
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
we would simply be
 
01:52:48.159 --> 01:52:49.030 align:start position:0%
we would simply be
hold

01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
hold
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
stopping the train in the station until
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
we can get better data which i think is
 
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
the responsible thing to do and i'd also
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
just like to put in a word
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about attracting younger
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
people to the state but i'd like to put
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
in a word for those of us who are not
 
01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:04.950 align:start position:0%
in a word for those of us who are not
young

01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
young
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
and for those of us who are struggling
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
to pay our property taxes that go up
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
every year relentlessly and that that
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
just you know do not fall into any one
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
of these categories and i know many
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
people in my community
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
who are in their 60s 70s and 80s who can
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
no longer stay in their homes
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
because of this shifting and raising of
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
property taxes and the combination of
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
those two things
 
01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
those two things
is

01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a killer for older
 
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.270 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a killer for older
people

01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh okay we're at this point we're at
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
hb 1055
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we have a motion on the table to otp
 
01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:52.030 align:start position:0%
and we have a motion on the table to otp
as

01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
amended um
 
01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.669 align:start position:0%
amended um
yes

01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh that motion's already been passed
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
right i don't know what
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
right we're we're in the reconsider
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
point are we gonna reconsider the vote
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to reconsider the uh
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
the last vote we took
 
01:54:14.159 --> 01:54:15.030 align:start position:0%
the last vote we took
so

01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh is there a motion to be made a new
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
so we have a recommendation rather a
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
motion ought to pass as amended
 
01:54:38.239 --> 01:54:39.350 align:start position:0%
motion ought to pass as amended
right

01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes you're all with me
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
all right so uh
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
mr clerk if you would call the roll i
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
just need who who made that motion
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
so we're now voting on otp as amended
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%

no i've gotta give some more forms

you need some more papers
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
the motion is to itl
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
the motion was made by pia monte and

01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
gilman

01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
now by the way while the clerk is
 
01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
arranging us papers if we
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
fyi if we itl this bill there'll be no
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
would it be in order
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
if we send it to the floor with an itl
 
01:58:27.599 --> 01:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
if we send it to the floor with an itl
recommendation

01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the meantime ask for
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
information as the clerk had said with
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
the with the impact not a fiscal note
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
but just the impact
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
and then would it
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to on the floor
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
we could have a
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh we could
 
01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.669 align:start position:0%
uh we could
uh

01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
vote down the itl motion
 
01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:55.510 align:start position:0%
vote down the itl motion
and

01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
pass an otp motion
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that an itl vote kills the
 
01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:12.149 align:start position:0%
i believe that an itl vote kills the
bill

01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
i stand corrected it can be overturned
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
on the floor so so it would be possible
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
if if you had really strong feelings
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
and if the fiscal impact to
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
the municipalities
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
was minimal
 
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
then we could bring it up on the floor
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
explain it
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:59:37.350 --> 01:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
based upon the feeling of the house we
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
could pass it
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent idea representative
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
los alas
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's what we all want to
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
to just have the information so we can
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
make a well-informed decision
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes and to follow up on your earlier
 
01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:55.270 align:start position:0%
yes and to follow up on your earlier

02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's all in your mind
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
but because we are idealing here in our
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
committee we have to request for the
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
financial whatever the fiscal note or
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
impact information so that you know you
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
can fight it on the floor
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
with the information
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
every representative
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm not sure
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily that we have to
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
an impact statement as such i think
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
whoever is going to speak to it
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
on the floor if they decide that they
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
want to speak to it as an ought to pass
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
they could bring up those facts and
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
figures and so on and if they wanted to
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
give it to their
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
to all of the members that would be
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know they could be sent to them
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
through whoever but
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we necessarily have to i
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
think it's more of us individual who's
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
ever going to speak to do our homework
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other input yes representative
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
i just have a i guess a question
 
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
we may have some other bills that are
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
very similar to these tax

credits whatever you want to call them
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%

committee now that we're going to have
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%

records of cost in order to pass these

well it's not not a policy it's a it
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
would be a decision based on what the

and it in that it downshifts
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh an increase in tax credits

there also right we will
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
have to take up the amendment as well
 
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%

have the amendment i don't have any
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
right no that's 170.
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's not 178.
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
do we have the amendment
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
1078 the amendment is
 
02:18:58.319 --> 02:19:01.509 align:start position:0%
1078 the amendment is
0648

02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:08.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
well let's uh let's get a copy of it and
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
spread it around okay mr chairman yeah
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm totally confused are we taking up
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
the gun stock bill now which is 10.78
 
02:19:20.479 --> 02:19:21.270 align:start position:0%
the gun stock bill now which is 10.78
right

02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
right
so

02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
does 1078 have an amendment or is it
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
only 10.70
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
that happens we're talking about 10.78
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
and it does happen
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm told it has an amendment i don't
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
i thought that was 10.70 that happened
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
yeah well you do have an amendment on
 
02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
1070 also i i don't think we have one on
 
02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:43.030 align:start position:0%
1070 also i i don't think we have one on
1078.

02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
1078.
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:50.710 --> 02:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i have a
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
procedural question with regard to
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
committees in executive session
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
is it the responsibility of the
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
obtain these amendments via email and
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
print them out on their own and bring
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
them in or is it the
 
02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
procedure of the committee to provide a
 
02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:13.110 align:start position:0%
procedure of the committee to provide a
printed

02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
printed
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment when we come into
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
the executive session
 
02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:17.910 align:start position:0%
the executive session
yes

02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
yes to what
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
yes to both
 
02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:22.309 align:start position:0%
yes to both
uh

02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
we typically get those
 
02:20:24.319 --> 02:20:25.110 align:start position:0%
we typically get those
uh

02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
when we enter the meeting
 
02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.389 align:start position:0%
when we enter the meeting
but

02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
i understand that some of these come
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
very late in the process so we're going
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
to take the time if if one of us has the
 
02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
to take the time if if one of us has the
amendment

02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure it gets passed around so we
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
mr sheriff i might add on to that
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
typically we get
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
the amendments from the sponsor and
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
they're obligated to print it out for us
 
02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:58.309 align:start position:0%
they're obligated to print it out for us
yes

02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so so we took
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
so we get them from heather
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
or we get them off the table in the
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
corner where the pink cards reside
 
02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:09.349 align:start position:0%
corner where the pink cards reside
or

02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
we get them
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
ahead of time in our emails so there's
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
multiple ways that these amendments are
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
distributed and i think i'd like to make
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
sure that responsibility lies with us
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
collectively to point out the fact that
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
someone has an amendment and someone
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't and we can stop and make sure we
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
all are on the same page yes
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'd like to respectfully
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
request that our committee adopt a
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
standard where whoever is sponsoring the
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
amendment i mean it could be the sponsor
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill it could be someone else
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
that it's their responsibility to
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
provide a hard copy before our meetings
 
02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
our executive sessions um i don't know
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
about all of you but my email is packed
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
and it it would be easy for me to
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
overlook an email that contained an uh
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
an amendment attachment
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
so it's much easier to have it available
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know at the executive session thank
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
you i understand what you're saying your
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:15.910 align:start position:0%
the
committee

02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
is in charge of the bill now
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
so it's their responsibility
 
02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
so it's their responsibility
to

02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
supply an amendment or somebody from the
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
enter that amendment um they can
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
talk with the sponsor
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
but once the sponsor cannot come up and
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
say okay i have an amendment here has to
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
be one person from this committee
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
let me echo that the the uh
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
that once we're in executive session
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
we own the bills we own the bill and we
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
on any amendments associated with the
 
02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.389 align:start position:0%
on any amendments associated with the
bills

02:22:52.389 --> 02:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
i and that's why i want to leave the
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
door as far open as i can
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
to get all
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
and any amendments that are
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
available to us yes representative
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh chairman i sent
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
you an amendment for hb 1177 i sent it
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
to you and i sent it to representative
 
02:23:14.399 --> 02:23:16.469 align:start position:0%
to you and i sent it to representative
maggiore

02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
maggiore
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago so
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
should i assume that that is going to
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
appear in hard copy tomorrow or should i
 
02:23:24.479 --> 02:23:25.590 align:start position:0%
appear in hard copy tomorrow or should i
bring

02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
bring
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
enough copies when i come in tomorrow
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
because we're executing that bill
 
02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:30.150 align:start position:0%
because we're executing that bill
tomorrow

02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
i would say if you make that assumption
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have about a 50 chance of it okay so
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the answer is i should
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
bring in my own hard copies tomorrow as
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
a backup i think you should okay thank
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to um address uh
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte's
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
statement i actually have an amendment
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
in a committee for a bill that i'm not
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
even on um it was a germain bill for
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
something a constituent brought up so i
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
i assume the responsibility of getting
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
that amendment drafted printed and
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
distributed to the community members so
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
there is that other way of getting
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
amendments and it doesn't have to come
 
02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
through the committee right
 
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
a case like that i would hope that
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's a co-sponsor associated with
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
that bill that you can hand that off to
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
that and make it easier for you so you
 
02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
miss one committee to help another
 
02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:23.750 align:start position:0%
miss one committee to help another
committee

02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i made the sponsor aware that
 
02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
i was going to piggyback on his bill
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
i would just respectfully
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
ask or suggest that is it too difficult
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
just to have these amendments printed
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
and on the table when when we come in it
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
just seems very round about you know
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
this person that person
 
02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
i'll reinforce that with heather and
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
you all can help if you know about an
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
amendment coming you can
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
you can
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
make sure she knows about it so that
 
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
when we get to that particular point of
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
the of the
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
process the bill will be there on the
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
table yes representative
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative truleven yes oh
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
i just want to let you know that this
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is from the sponsor one of the
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
he did email it to us and heather has
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
no record in her
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what that's why i've been
 
02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:22.790 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what that's why i've been
saying

02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
that that i don't want to shut off any i
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
if one of us has it has it
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunate but at least we can
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
spread it from there if we all have it
 
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:34.950 align:start position:0%
spread it from there if we all have it
better

02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
if we have it from heather that's one uh
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
then you know
 
02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i don't want to try to penalize
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
any of the sponsors
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh or interested parties by
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
not hearing an amendment because i i
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%

email to everyone in the group however
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who this applies to
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
microphones are on and clicking of pens
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
is extremely distracting when trying to
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
follow along with the hearing thank you
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%

02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
bringing it to the thanks all right well
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for that input uh let's be
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
mindful of the fact that if our
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
microphones are on we have to uh
 
02:26:44.309 --> 02:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
adhere to some amount of level of
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
silence they don't need to be in a cone
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
of silence but you should understand
 
02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:49.750 align:start position:0%
of silence but you should understand
that

02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
our actions comments whispers
 
02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:54.870 align:start position:0%
our actions comments whispers
noises

02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
noises
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
are picked up by these microphones which
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
are very sensitive
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
mine is the one that stays on all the
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
time but if if you're if you're going to
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
speak you should turn your microphone on
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then when you're done turn it off
 
02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:12.630 align:start position:0%
and then when you're done turn it off
please

02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
so we are looking at uh
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
1078 which is
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%

02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
have any discussion until uh
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%

i don't see representative silver here
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%

presenting

02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
i used to have a policy when i was chair
 
02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
that one of the members would have to
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
bring forward an amendment just for that
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
reason so they could talk to it because
 
02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
we couldn't bring other people in that's
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
why it makes it more i'll be asking for
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
so we are
 
02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
now for those of you in the audience who
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
have been very patient
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
house bill 1078 which is
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
relative to budget procedures for the
 
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald do you have a
 
02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:30.710 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald do you have a
motion

02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%

02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
h

02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
h
 
02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%

02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
is the discussion about this amendment
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
before we move forward yes
 
02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:55.030 align:start position:0%
before we move forward yes
representative

02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote in opposition to the
 
02:33:59.270 --> 02:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
amendment just because i think it
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
requires input by the commission members
 
02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
and people we heard testimony from
 
02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:06.389 align:start position:0%
and people we heard testimony from
um

02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know i'm disappointed this bill even
 
02:34:12.550 --> 02:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
came forward i wish that commission was
 
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough county they're so
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
successful i think if it's not broken
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
don't fix it
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
and any amendment that even addresses
 
02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
that without input from
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
um the stakeholders i i just i i would
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
not be able to accept it thank you thank
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
you any further discussion yes
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative lee
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i think during the
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
testimony i had asked a question as to
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not they had been
 
02:34:38.319 --> 02:34:39.990 align:start position:0%
whether or not they had been
presented

02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
presented
 
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
with budgets and so on and asked for
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
input and
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think at one point it was quite quite
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
confusing because certain people said no
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and then i believe we got a follow-up
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
email that showed us that they had in
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
fact been doing
 
02:34:56.550 --> 02:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
what had been asked of them and what we
 
02:34:58.950 --> 02:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
would expect of them so for that reason
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
i i have to vote no on this as well
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you by the way is there anybody on
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
the committee that would like to step
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
forward and explain this amendment to
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:13.990 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%

hb 1087
 
02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
relative to zoning to single family
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
we have a motion
 
02:42:36.479 --> 02:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
we have a motion
um

02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
emotions made to itl seconded by

02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on the on the motion
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative davis
 
02:43:13.269 --> 02:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
um so i support this bill
 
02:43:17.030 --> 02:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
because uh it it does what we all have
 
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
said in various hearings and testimonies
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
that we want to do which is to keep the
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
rural parts of new hampshire rural
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
and increase housing for single family
 
02:43:29.359 --> 02:43:30.710 align:start position:0%
and increase housing for single family
homes

02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
in those areas where they are served by
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
public water and sewer and that is
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill does
 
02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
and so therefore i support it in the
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
hopes that will be one other small step
 
02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
forward in trying to combat the housing
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
crisis that we custom that we currently
 
02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:51.910 align:start position:0%
crisis that we custom that we currently
have

02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
while not changing the rural character
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
of our state
 
02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
a great idea but in my community we have
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
a master plan
 
02:44:07.279 --> 02:44:08.550 align:start position:0%
a master plan
and

02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
our water and silver is pretty much
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
maxed out
 
02:44:12.319 --> 02:44:13.110 align:start position:0%
maxed out
uh

02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
and if we put in
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
four houses in one acre lots that are
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to be one one house we're going
 
02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
to be talking probably 25 30 million
 
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
dollars to
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
upgrade our sewer treatment plant
 
02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
again i think it's a great idea but it's
 
02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:27.670 align:start position:0%
again i think it's a great idea but it's
just

02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
be too taxing on my community to support
 
02:44:33.269 --> 02:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
this bill to change our master plan to
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
go from maybe four single dwellings to
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
16 residents
 
02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:41.670 align:start position:0%
16 residents
representative

02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
this is does not specify for four homes
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
or anything it changes lot sizes which
 
02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:52.150 align:start position:0%
or anything it changes lot sizes which
allows

02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
allows
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
more homes and create density but i have
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
to agree that
 
02:44:59.830 --> 02:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
i i think it would be best to allow each
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities to determine
 
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
how they need to create their own
 
02:45:09.269 --> 02:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
master plan and i can say in nashville
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
we have a master plan as well and there
 
02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
are certain areas that are zoned to do
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
something that would effectively
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
kill six of nashua's current zoning
 
02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
so i i can't support this i think each
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
municipality should have their own say
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:26.309 --> 02:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
represents davis
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
i would just like to follow up by saying
 
02:45:30.550 --> 02:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
that the bill specifically says that the
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
watts cannot exceed existing municipal
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
or community water and sewer
 
02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:38.550 align:start position:0%
or community water and sewer
infrastructure

02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
any any further comments is
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative fan
 
02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes chairman thank you
 
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:46.240 align:start position:0%

02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:47.590 align:start position:0%
and i'd also like to remind everyone
that

02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
state statute allows the community to
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
say you can't do this thing because it
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
does in fact exceed our capacity it's
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
called scattered and premature
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
so again again the bill says
 
02:46:04.309 --> 02:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
you don't have to enact this if your
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
current water and sewer doesn't allow it
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
and even if you don't know that and you
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
find it out
 
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
the existing statute would allow you to
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
to deny it
 
02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
and i'd also like to add
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
we've waited for 40 years for individual
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
towns to allow historically appropriate
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
density i did a survey of a town in new
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire pretty ordinary town in new
 
02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire to determine what the actual
 
02:46:35.429 --> 02:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
historic lot size was
 
02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
and in peterborough the actual historic
 
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
lot size is less than a quarter of an
 
02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:40.790 align:start position:0%
lot size is less than a quarter of an
acre

02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
acre
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's about ads between 6 000 and 8 000
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
square feet in the part of town that
 
02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
does in fact have water and sewer so i
 
02:46:50.309 --> 02:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
just offer that
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
as information that historically
 
02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
not too far off from what our existing
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
lot sizes are and that decisions that
 
02:47:03.910 --> 02:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
were made over the last 50 60 years to
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
require larger lots in an effort to
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
manage growth
 
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
actually have given us
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
a form of growth that is not
 
02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
not sustainable
 
02:47:16.319 --> 02:47:17.190 align:start position:0%
not sustainable
as

02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
representatives davis pointed out it
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
spreads development into the rural
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
district because if you can't
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
use a small lot in the center of town
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
you have to go to the outside and
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
when you create larger lots
 
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
outside of town
 
02:47:38.469 --> 02:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
you are also committing the town to the
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those roads which as i
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
say every time i talk about roads costs
 
02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
us 4.65
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
a center line foot every year
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
for every foot of roads to salt sand
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
plow ditch and mow and that is not
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
including building the thing or repaving
 
02:47:59.269 --> 02:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
it when the time comes
 
02:48:01.830 --> 02:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i am in favor of this bill for all
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
those reasons because it does allow the
 
02:48:06.630 --> 02:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
towns to opt out if their infrastructure
 
02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
won't support it
 
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
and it encourages historically
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate density
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
in the parts of town that do have
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
services thank you additional discussion
 
02:48:18.469 --> 02:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd just like to
 
02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh as a selectmen when i see shell
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
require in any bill
 
02:48:30.309 --> 02:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh i i really get concerned about that
 
02:48:30.319 --> 02:48:31.510 align:start position:0%
uh i i really get concerned about that
because

02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
every one of our towns in new hampshire
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different and
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
a shoe doesn't fit everybody
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
every foot so
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
i i was concerned about that and then
 
02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
when i see that
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
although the bill is well intended and
 
02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
we do have a housing pro
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
problem but i think there's there's too
 
02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:53.030 align:start position:0%
problem but i think there's there's too
many

02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:54.469 align:start position:0%
many
uh

02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:57.030 --> 02:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
individual town difficulties when you
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
designate it a hundred square foot lot
 
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
size for single family home
 
02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a good idea i would like
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
to see it
 
02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
to see it
in

02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:49:11.349 --> 02:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
my community my community is hampstead
 
02:49:13.990 --> 02:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
is mostly all built up
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately as far as the housing
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
problem is concerned we have more three
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand four hundred thousand
 
02:49:23.279 --> 02:49:24.870 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand four hundred thousand
homes

02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:49:27.429 --> 02:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
than we probably can justify with the
 
02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
way things are now but i can't fit vote
 
02:49:32.070 --> 02:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
for this bill mainly because
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
to do a particular planning that they
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
can do on their own if they wish and i
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
don't think the state should be telling
 
02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:44.630 align:start position:0%
don't think the state should be telling
them

02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion mr
 
02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:47.910 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion mr
chair

chair
yes

yes
 
02:49:53.830 --> 02:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i am in support of
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
i want to bring some attention to the
 
02:49:57.920 --> 02:49:59.990 align:start position:0%
i want to bring some attention to the
online

02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:50:03.269 --> 02:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
support and oppose there were 23 support
 
02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
and seven opposing
 
02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:07.670 align:start position:0%
and seven opposing
and

02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
when we have such acute shortage just in
 
02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
my city we have 5
 
02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:15.110 align:start position:0%
my city we have 5
000

02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:50:17.110 --> 02:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
unit shortage
 
02:50:19.510 --> 02:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
so we have to you know we just cannot
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
keep saying we are not going to do
 
02:50:24.550 --> 02:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
anything this is going to affect
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
and it does give the municipalities and
 
02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
that rural towns to
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
do what's best for their community it
 
02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:34.070 align:start position:0%
do what's best for their community it
it's

02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:35.590 align:start position:0%
it's
so

02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:38.550 --> 02:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
if we don't do anything we are driving
 
02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:39.910 align:start position:0%
if we don't do anything we are driving
workforce

02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
02:50:43.750 --> 02:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
housing workforce from our state
 
02:50:47.190 --> 02:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
out and it's an economic
 
02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:48.150 align:start position:0%
out and it's an economic
engine

02:50:48.150 --> 02:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
engine
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
that drives our state's economy so with
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
that in mind
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
i will support this because we need
 
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
more housing thank you thank you
 
02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.070 align:start position:0%
more housing thank you thank you
representative

02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
the primary reason i'm against this
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
is because
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
this would create a statewide mandate
 
02:51:16.469 --> 02:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
it removes
 
02:51:18.389 --> 02:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
the ability of the local planning
 
02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
land use planning
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
to create ordinances that fit
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
the uh needs and desires of the uh towns
 
02:51:30.309 --> 02:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
that they exist in
 
02:51:34.230 --> 02:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to vote no on this bill
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
additional comments
 
02:51:39.429 --> 02:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative lasallus
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
i would just like to
 
02:51:44.309 --> 02:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
make a comment that
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
following up on uh representative van's
 
02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
comment about the
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've been waiting for
 
02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
individual towns to
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
make these changes
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
and and i agree with that uh issue i
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
just this morning

but
 
02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
what is impacting us
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%

if you want me to the amendment
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it came with the hearing it's what
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
was presented as at the hearing
 
03:45:23.830 --> 03:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
he came in with this amendment
 
03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
all right let's formalize this up a
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
little bit uh
 
03:45:29.590 --> 03:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
let's see if we have a motion
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
on 1098
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh mr uh representative ayer do you have
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.150 --> 03:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
is there a second ito
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
i i think we have to adopt the amendment
 
03:45:48.479 --> 03:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
i i think we have to adopt the amendment
first

03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
okay we could just we could just kill
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
the bell and ignore the advent amendment
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's one thing we do but i i have a
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
tendency to want to include
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
rather than exclude so i've got i'm
 
03:46:04.950 --> 03:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
look for a motion to
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
to open the the bill and then we'll well
 
03:46:12.150 --> 03:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
we'll take a motion to
 
03:46:12.160 --> 03:46:13.349 align:start position:0%
we'll take a motion to
either

03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
add the amendment or
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
all right um i will say that the prime
 
03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:33.510 align:start position:0%

sponsor
 
03:46:36.070 --> 03:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh did present the amendment to us at
 
03:46:38.469 --> 03:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
the time of the original hearing if that
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
makes a difference to us
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
i do remember that
 
03:46:44.550 --> 03:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so i'm happy to make an emotion
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%

03:46:48.479 --> 03:46:49.269 align:start position:0%
uh adopt the the amendment
and

03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
we can make a decision on that and then
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
we can vote on the underlying bill okay
 
03:46:56.550 --> 03:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
is there is there a second on uh
 
03:47:00.630 --> 03:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
otp on the amendment right and then
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%

03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
after we've got a second on that motion
 
03:47:07.439 --> 03:47:14.630 align:start position:0%
after we've got a second on that motion

thank you zero six one zero h
 
03:47:34.389 --> 03:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
here we have a motion on the amendment
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%

03:47:38.950 --> 03:47:38.960 align:start position:0%

03:47:41.279 --> 03:47:44.469 align:start position:0%
yes representative
um

03:47:44.469 --> 03:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:44.479 --> 03:47:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
eric

03:47:45.510 --> 03:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
eric
 
03:47:45.520 --> 03:47:46.790 align:start position:0%
eric
gallagher

03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
gallagher
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
to be clear as to what the amendment
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
does it basically just inserts the words
 
03:47:59.349 --> 03:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.429 --> 03:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
it inserts off street
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
not on street oh okay i think because
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
what it's he's what the what the
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and the underlying bill both
 
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
seek to do
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
is to restrict the number of off-street
 
03:48:15.510 --> 03:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
parking spaces that can be required for
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
any individual dwelling unit
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
more discussion on the on the amendment
 
03:48:23.429 --> 03:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
representative van do you want to talk
 
03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
about it some more
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to say that i think that
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
parking regulations are a huge problem
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of housing however i do not
 
03:48:37.189 --> 03:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
recommend that we adopt the bill because
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
i think it does not
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
this isn't let's
 
03:48:46.389 --> 03:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:46.399 --> 03:48:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.600 --> 03:48:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
why

03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
why are we doing this first of all
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
i just don't get it are we regulating
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
traffic in manchester or
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh are we not allowing people to buy a
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
second car and have one placed in an
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
area you know i mean let's let's
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
narrow this to
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
i can actually respond
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
i want to narrow it to the amount this
 
03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment that he's asking
 
03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
about uh i did not bring this bill but i
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
can tell you that
 
03:49:23.030 --> 03:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh the underlying idea here was
 
03:49:26.150 --> 03:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
that when a jurisdiction
 
03:49:26.160 --> 03:49:27.830 align:start position:0%
that when a jurisdiction
requires

03:49:27.830 --> 03:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
requires
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
excessive parking
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
that it it costs more money to build
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
that building
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it uses up land that could be used
 
03:49:39.510 --> 03:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
for housing
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
so wait i i am not in favor of this
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
either the amendment or the bill because
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is the way to manage
 
03:49:46.319 --> 03:49:47.189 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is the way to manage
it

03:49:47.189 --> 03:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
but that's the underlying theory behind
 
03:49:54.150 --> 03:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
it if you take a car space is about 200
 
03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
square feet so if you require two off
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
street parking spaces and you have to
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
have a drive aisle you're now at about
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
750 square feet
 
03:50:05.189 --> 03:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
for parking for that unit which is
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
another unit
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
so that's the the theory behind it i
 
03:50:12.389 --> 03:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
don't think this is the way to do it
 
03:50:14.790 --> 03:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion on the
 
03:50:16.950 --> 03:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
on the floor to uh
 
03:50:21.429 --> 03:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
to adopt this amendment as presented
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:27.990 --> 03:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay mr clark
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
is justifying another meeting if you
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
give me all right he's going to oh yeah
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%

i have questions um representative power
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you can help me um when we had
 
03:58:42.150 --> 03:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
testimony um specifically we had from ms
 
03:58:43.830 --> 03:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
heck at the new hampshire municipal
 
03:58:43.840 --> 03:58:46.469 align:start position:0%
heck at the new hampshire municipal
association

03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
association
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
it appears there were multiple
 
03:58:48.000 --> 03:58:49.670 align:start position:0%
it appears there were multiple
technicalities

03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
technicalities
 
03:58:52.150 --> 03:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
and also from mr
 
03:58:52.160 --> 03:58:53.830 align:start position:0%
and also from mr
nauer

03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
nauer
 
03:58:55.910 --> 03:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
he's supervisor of the municipal bureau
 
03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
at dra
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
he also cited two court cases relative
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
that this would be in conflict with
 
03:59:07.990 --> 03:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
court decisions made in 2016 and 2017.
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering does this only
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
correct that one technicality or or all
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
of them
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
and that is correct the the amendment
 
03:59:19.110 --> 03:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
only addresses that
 
03:59:19.120 --> 03:59:19.910 align:start position:0%
only addresses that
um

03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
the strikeout on line 23. it does not
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
address any of those
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
points you raised okay
 
03:59:29.510 --> 03:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
with that then i'm going to be opposed
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%

04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
so in my book that means a fail
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to uh we'll come back to
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
well mr mr chair mr chair i i
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%

04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
from it
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh at this point uh
 
04:02:47.189 --> 04:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
it fails
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
yeah the amendment failed to be adopted
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
so now we're on the underlying bill
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
we'll go you're right we'll go to the uh
 
04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 197 colon 6 refers to petition
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:29.189 --> 04:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me why it's in statute
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know currently the default budget no
 
04:03:36.150 --> 04:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the house bill 1070
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not sure what the point
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
the connection between the default
 
04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
budgets and what you just said yeah
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
exactly so
 
04:03:58.870 --> 04:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why it's why it's
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
there right now if somebody could um
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a comment comment on
 
04:04:10.150 --> 04:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
that further and give some other in
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair before this comment i just
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
asked you was there a disposition on
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:20.710 --> 04:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
anybody have any comment for
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative power as to
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill which is which is relative to
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
default budgets and official ballot
 
04:04:31.110 --> 04:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
she has a concern about what we're
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
voting on well i was just going to make
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
04:04:39.670 --> 04:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
mr chair i moved before we make a motion
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%

04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me the uh adopting the amendment
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
was a tie so it failed so we are left
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
then with the bill which at this point
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
has no motion unless i am incorrect
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative power has a question
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
about the bill itself
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%

04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:19.040 --> 04:05:20.389 align:start position:0%

where we are in the process so
 
04:05:27.199 --> 04:05:28.229 align:start position:0%

and the the amendment failed
 
04:05:39.510 --> 04:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
so we're back to the base bill
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%

disposition the bill either otp or itl
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
or there's one other option
 
04:05:49.920 --> 04:05:52.229 align:start position:0%
or there's one other option
but

04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:56.150 --> 04:05:56.160 align:start position:0%

okay what's the motion now yes i move
 
04:06:03.189 --> 04:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1070 is recommended for an
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
expedia to legislate
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%

representative to sell us
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
i think this bill
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
is gets right to the
 
04:06:28.560 --> 04:06:30.070 align:start position:0%
is gets right to the

04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
and going over the operating budget
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
if there is no control over what is in
 
04:07:18.150 --> 04:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
the default budget
 
04:07:21.510 --> 04:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
then all that exhaustive work
 
04:07:25.110 --> 04:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
that went in by the budget committee
 
04:07:25.120 --> 04:07:26.630 align:start position:0%
that went in by the budget committee
is

04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
is thrown aside
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
if the default budget happens to be
 
04:07:32.720 --> 04:07:34.229 align:start position:0%
if the default budget happens to be
greater

04:07:34.229 --> 04:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
greater
 
04:07:37.110 --> 04:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
than the than the proposed operating
 
04:07:37.120 --> 04:07:38.389 align:start position:0%
than the than the proposed operating
budget

04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
and we've in my particular
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
case in our town
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
we have an sb2 situation
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
and repeatedly
 
04:07:51.510 --> 04:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
time and time again
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:55.520 --> 04:07:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
exceeds

04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
exceeds
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
the proposed operating budget
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
at fallback position in case the
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
so i really think that there needs to be
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
some sort of control
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
over that
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
that default budget so it is indeed
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
put back
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
to where it was supposed to be
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
the jury
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my concern
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
with this bill uh is parent three less
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
any reductions to an appropriation the
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
governing body
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
made in the proposed operating budget
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's a member of the select board with a
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
in an sb2 town that has an official
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
budget committee i propose my select
 
04:08:58.630 --> 04:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
board proposes a budget and then hands
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
that to the budget committee
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
the default budget then would be based
 
04:09:03.680 --> 04:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
the default budget then would be based
on

04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
the budget that i proposed
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
i see this if this bill passes as a way
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
for a select board
 
04:09:16.389 --> 04:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
to pump that proposed budget up or or
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
flatten it out
 
04:09:17.840 --> 04:09:18.630 align:start position:0%
flatten it out
with

04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
no discretion a proposed operating
 
04:09:21.359 --> 04:09:22.790 align:start position:0%
no discretion a proposed operating
budget

04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:09:25.030 --> 04:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i could propose my budget's 8 million
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
dollars i could propose a 30 million
 
04:09:27.439 --> 04:09:28.389 align:start position:0%
dollars i could propose a 30 million
dollar

04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
operating budget that then becomes a
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
default budget
 
04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
or less it says less any reductions to
 
04:09:34.630 --> 04:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
the appropriate budget excuse me so i
 
04:09:36.149 --> 04:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
could go in there somebody wrote could
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
say i'm going to make that a three
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
million dollar budget
 
04:09:41.110 --> 04:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
and that is the proposed budget that
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
goes into default
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see there being discretion there
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm proposing a responsible budget
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
at that point that we hope then is
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
adopted i would like to see that being
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
what we are considering less or adjusted
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
for any one-time appropriations as the
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
dra has set forth in statute so my
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
concern is over those words proposed
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
operating budget it gives me grave
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:08.880 --> 04:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with this budget you
 
04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
know we've been going through default
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
budget uh nudges at this
 
04:10:19.920 --> 04:10:21.030 align:start position:0%
budget uh nudges at this
sorry

04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh we've been
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
nudging at this default budget idea for
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
a few years
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the idea that the default budget
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.149 --> 04:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
negated because of circumstances such as
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh the retirement of a
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh bond in that one year
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
one year in the de help budget see if i
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
get this straight
 
04:10:47.520 --> 04:10:48.870 align:start position:0%
get this straight
um

04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:51.110 --> 04:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
a proposed budget doesn't have that bond
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
payment anymore
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
but the default budget would be based on
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
the current fiscal year's budget the
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
active budget this is taking three
 
04:11:01.110 --> 04:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
different budgets to make the default
 
04:11:01.120 --> 04:11:02.950 align:start position:0%
different budgets to make the default
budget

04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:11:02.960 --> 04:11:03.990 align:start position:0%
budget
so

04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:04.000 --> 04:11:05.590 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:11:05.590 --> 04:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes the default budget will be
 
04:11:09.110 --> 04:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
higher because you've retired
 
04:11:10.149 --> 04:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
a debt
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
in your proposed budget yep but about
 
04:11:15.349 --> 04:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
04:11:19.349 --> 04:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
less any reduction in appropriation the
 
04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
governing body made in the proposed
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
totally conflicts with line 18
 
04:11:25.600 --> 04:11:26.229 align:start position:0%
totally conflicts with line 18
d

04:11:26.229 --> 04:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
d
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
and the definition of contracts
 
04:11:28.880 --> 04:11:29.910 align:start position:0%
and the definition of contracts
which

04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
contracts previously approved in the
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
amount so approved
 
04:11:39.429 --> 04:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
so even if in your proposed budget
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
you're approving something less
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
the default budget will go back to
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
that year
 
04:11:49.590 --> 04:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
the operating year that you're in it'll
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
go back to that contract price
 
04:11:52.319 --> 04:11:54.149 align:start position:0%
go back to that contract price
so

04:11:54.149 --> 04:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want it in your operating but
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
your proposed budget but you have to
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
have it because it's contract
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
so it's directly
 
04:12:05.189 --> 04:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
it directly
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think makes a circle of the
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
line nine and line
 
04:12:09.520 --> 04:12:10.870 align:start position:0%
line nine and line
eighteen

04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
eighteen
 
04:12:14.630 --> 04:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um i agree with
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
what representative gilman said i'm i'm
 
04:12:27.750 --> 04:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
concerned with the the technical
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
conflicts that this bill creates with
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
language that's already in statute
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's not addressed in the bill
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
i definitely sympathize with represent
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
lasalles because
 
04:12:42.389 --> 04:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
merrimack is a senate bill to town and
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
i think for the past several years our
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
default budget's been greater than our
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
proposed operating budget
 
04:12:49.680 --> 04:12:51.510 align:start position:0%
proposed operating budget
however

04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
at the deliberative session the voters
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
still have they can
 
04:12:59.110 --> 04:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
amend the proposed budget to be
 
04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
lower and that so the voters on the
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
election day still have the choice of do
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
they want the lower
 
04:13:08.309 --> 04:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
even if it's amended a deliberative
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
session if they want that budget amount
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
or the default budget so voters still
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
have a choice
 
04:13:14.239 --> 04:13:15.349 align:start position:0%
have a choice
um

04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
and and i think you know maybe we need
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
to look more at the default budget to
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
make sure there's a clean bill that
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't propose conflicts
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
um but this this bill doesn't really um
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't think it's going to be
 
04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
workable for
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
some of those reasons that
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative gilman brought up thank
 
04:13:31.279 --> 04:13:31.910 align:start position:0%
representative gilman brought up thank
you

04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
yes question
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:35.760 --> 04:13:36.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
on an average how many people do you
 
04:13:38.560 --> 04:13:43.110 align:start position:0%
on an average how many people do you
have

04:13:43.110 --> 04:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh well we have two deliberative
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
sessions we have one for the town and
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
one for the school district and it
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
depends what um
 
04:13:53.110 --> 04:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
what what's on the warrant
 
04:13:54.389 --> 04:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
and if it was last year or the year
 
04:13:56.399 --> 04:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
and if it was last year or the year
before

04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:14:00.630 --> 04:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of people um because there
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
was um
 
04:14:04.710 --> 04:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
i i forget what it was representative b
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
monty there was something
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
that got the attention of people more
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
that they were at the deliberative
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
session there's been some deliberative
 
04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
sessions when the the people that had to
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
be there the school board the budget
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee the attorney the moderator
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
that numbered more than they the res of
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
the voters coming but it really all
 
04:14:23.670 --> 04:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
depends on
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
what's you know what is on the warrant
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
if there's anything specific
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
typically i think one year we had a
 
04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
warrant article
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
to replace the football field with
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
artificial turf those kind of things
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
tends to draw more people but it's
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
yes okay i um
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:23.910 --> 04:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
the default budget
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
for the school board the default budget
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
was 7 million i'd say 900 000
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the actual budget was 7 million uh
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars less so
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
it gave you no option
 
04:15:40.950 --> 04:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
to choose
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what this bill is
 
04:15:50.550 --> 04:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%

to the public hearing there was some
 
04:20:09.990 --> 04:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh question as to
 
04:20:12.070 --> 04:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
garbage bags that might be purchased
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
like hefty garbage bags or something so
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
um this amendment clarifies that the
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
um referring to bags that are used at
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
the point of sale
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.389 --> 04:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
04:20:33.910 --> 04:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:20:33.920 --> 04:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
yes representative
um

04:20:35.110 --> 04:20:35.120 align:start position:0%

04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:20:39.750 --> 04:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
question to the amendment representative
 
04:20:42.070 --> 04:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
who brought the amendment this will
 
04:20:42.080 --> 04:20:43.269 align:start position:0%
who brought the amendment this will
address

04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
the issue of our hefty
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
bags our single use or
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
not right so
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
making it point a sale
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
would be at the checkout counter correct
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment talks about plastic
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
bags and paper bags was that the
 
04:21:15.670 --> 04:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
intention include paper bags
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
i believe it was
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's not an ore situation plastic bags
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
or paper bags it's a either
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
plastic if if a municipality wants to
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
regulate the distribution of plastic
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
bags and paper bags they can but it one
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
regulating one can exclude the other
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
how do you interpret that that way um
 
04:21:42.630 --> 04:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know in my town this isn't going to
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
apply this is enabling legislation but
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
suppose there's a town that wants the
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
the business to ask the customer do you
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
want a bag and if you do want a bag do
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
you want a plastic bag or a paper bag
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's regulating the distribution there
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
might be some towns that elect to ban
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
both paper and plastic there might be
 
04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
some that choose to ban one or the other
 
04:22:11.120 --> 04:22:12.149 align:start position:0%
some that choose to ban one or the other
um

04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
it just
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
is if there's bags made out of plastic
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
or paper it gives the the municipality
 
04:22:23.670 --> 04:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
the option of of regulating that at the
 
04:22:27.910 --> 04:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.920 --> 04:22:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair isn't this the
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation which attempts to
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the single use
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
back by
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh offering the choice of bringing your
 
04:22:43.760 --> 04:22:44.830 align:start position:0%
uh offering the choice of bringing your
own

04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
reusable bags at the point of sale
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
hence the
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
single use plastic or paper is not
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't speak for the sponsor
 
04:23:04.229 --> 04:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
but i suspect the prime sponsor but i
 
04:23:06.870 --> 04:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
suspect that was her intent
 
04:23:06.880 --> 04:23:07.670 align:start position:0%
suspect that was her intent
um

04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
i signed on to this bill because it is
 
04:23:12.309 --> 04:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
enabling and if you look at other things
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
that are in that area the statute we're
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
allowing municipalities to regulate
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlors and
 
04:23:21.910 --> 04:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
noise and
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
political contributions in local
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
elections retail display of martial arts
 
04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
weapons so
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking if municipalities why not
 
04:23:33.189 --> 04:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
enable them to make a decision about
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:38.880 --> 04:23:40.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:23:40.710 --> 04:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:23:45.110 --> 04:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering what your definition
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
of distribution is
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
would that uh uh include
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative yeah i i think
 
04:24:02.790 --> 04:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i think distribution could require
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
sale it could be the giving of the bag
 
04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
um it's just how that transfer of the
 
04:24:10.389 --> 04:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
bag is made at the point of sale to the
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
customer that that process and anything
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
that would be involved in it
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have a
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up the reason i asked that is uh
 
04:24:25.269 --> 04:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
i believe it during the testimony that
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
people were talking about
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
how they uh the paper bags was included
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
because there might be a
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
some thoughts about requiring a 10 cent
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
deposit on paper bags in the future so
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's i don't know if a deposit is a
 
04:24:42.239 --> 04:24:43.110 align:start position:0%
that's i don't know if a deposit is a
sale

04:24:43.110 --> 04:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
sale
 
04:24:45.910 --> 04:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
but uh it it would seem to limit the
 
04:24:48.309 --> 04:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
distribution of paper bags so that's why
 
04:24:51.750 --> 04:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
i ask is distribution just
 
04:24:53.670 --> 04:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
when plastic bags are given to the
 
04:24:53.680 --> 04:24:54.790 align:start position:0%
when plastic bags are given to the
customers

04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:24:58.229 --> 04:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
or does it include sale of paper bags or
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
does it include just deposit on a paper
 
04:25:00.800 --> 04:25:02.950 align:start position:0%
does it include just deposit on a paper
bag

04:25:02.950 --> 04:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
bag
 
04:25:05.429 --> 04:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm reading the word distribution in
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
a broad sense so it would be inclusive
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
of any transaction whether it's given at
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
a cost or not
 
04:25:12.399 --> 04:25:13.670 align:start position:0%
a cost or not
um

04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:13.680 --> 04:25:14.710 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
like i said before my my intent with
 
04:25:20.469 --> 04:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
this was just to allow municipalities to
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
make decisions that they think are in
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
their best interest
 
04:25:27.670 --> 04:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:25:29.830 --> 04:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
i think that the issue that we're trying
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
to do here is allow jurisdictions to
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
make whatever decisions so for example
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
under distribution i would imagine that
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
this would include charging you a nickel
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
for a paper bag
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
charging you a nickel for
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
a plastic bag
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
saying that we're not going to let you
 
04:25:53.110 --> 04:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
use plastic bags anymore whatever the
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
local jurisdiction
 
04:25:59.110 --> 04:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
decides among itself is reasonable
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
is the intent of the bill as i
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
04:26:05.269 --> 04:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
and as representative brung says it's
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation each individual
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
town would have to decide what they
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.080 --> 04:26:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
mr

04:26:13.830 --> 04:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
mr
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i know back in uh
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
i'm dating back i don't know how many
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
grocery stores in my area would say if i
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
brought my own reusable bag i would get
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh five dollar five cents
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
of credit
 
04:26:37.110 --> 04:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
at the check you know so that was an
 
04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
incentive to bring my own bag
 
04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
and uh but it it's not happening so this
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
in that enabled
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
the use of or reduce the use of me
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
getting reusable plastic or paper
 
04:26:54.790 --> 04:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
so that incentive
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
charging five cents for a plastic bag
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
one time use plastic or paper
 
04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
or giving five cents credit for bringing
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
04:27:12.070 --> 04:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'm having a little bit of difficulty
 
04:27:14.070 --> 04:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
with the base legislation it's not the
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment because the amendment didn't
 
04:27:15.520 --> 04:27:16.870 align:start position:0%
amendment because the amendment didn't
change

04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:27:19.110 --> 04:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
but it's the distribution of single-use
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
plastic bags and paper bags to customers
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
i would be more comfortable if it said
 
04:27:27.590 --> 04:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
either or he gave some gave the
 
04:27:30.229 --> 04:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
retailers a
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
an option to use one or the other not
 
04:27:35.110 --> 04:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
right now the way it's written it has to
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.319 --> 04:27:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i actually think that's
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
not what it says
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
i think what it says is individual
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions may regulate the
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
description descrip distribution
 
04:27:50.800 --> 04:27:51.750 align:start position:0%
description descrip distribution
of

04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:51.760 --> 04:27:52.710 align:start position:0%
of
both

04:27:52.710 --> 04:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:27:55.110 --> 04:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
and that's my word single-use plastic
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
bags and
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
paper bags so a jurisdiction
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
and it's the jurisdiction that makes the
 
04:28:01.760 --> 04:28:02.950 align:start position:0%
and it's the jurisdiction that makes the
decision

04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
not the retailer
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction can decide that they
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
legislate against the use of plastic
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
bags that they want to legislate against
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
them by requiring that
 
04:28:17.590 --> 04:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
merchants charge for them
 
04:28:19.830 --> 04:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
or they could legislate against paper
 
04:28:19.840 --> 04:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
or they could legislate against paper
bags

04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
bags
 
04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
the same way or they could legislate
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's what i think is happening here so
 
04:28:31.110 --> 04:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're saying that and and there's an
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
argument to be made that paper bags are
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
worse than them plastic bags they're
 
04:28:36.870 --> 04:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
heavier they use more materials to
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
produce them
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
they don't actually degrade as fast as
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
we think they do
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
so i think that allowing towns to make a
 
04:28:44.800 --> 04:28:45.830 align:start position:0%
so i think that allowing towns to make a
decision

04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:28:49.110 --> 04:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
about both plastic and paper
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to use representatives
 
04:28:55.520 --> 04:28:57.510 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to use representatives
band's

04:28:57.510 --> 04:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
band's
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
method of parsing the the sentence to
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
bring up
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
another issue i think
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
she read
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
regulating the distribution of
 
04:29:08.389 --> 04:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags
 
04:29:11.110 --> 04:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
and plastic and paper bags
 
04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
that sentence could also be read to
 
04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
regulating the distribution of single
 
04:29:15.199 --> 04:29:16.550 align:start position:0%
regulating the distribution of single

04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
plastic bags and paper bags so does this
 
04:29:23.590 --> 04:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
include single-use paper bags
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
yes my my reading of it
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
you can't get any other
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
any other reading out of that
 
04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.469 --> 04:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
letter q
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
regulating the distribution of single
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
paper bags and
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
i'd rather single-use plastic bags and
 
04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
paper bags to customers i don't see you
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
can read it any other way other than
 
04:29:57.670 --> 04:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
both are going to be
 
04:29:59.110 --> 04:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
going to be uh
 
04:30:01.590 --> 04:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
regulated yeah why are we discussing the
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill when we're supposed to be
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment
 
04:30:09.189 --> 04:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
04:30:10.640 --> 04:30:12.550 align:start position:0%
what's that
here

04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
all right never mind thank you sorry to
 
04:30:14.640 --> 04:30:19.830 align:start position:0%
all right never mind thank you sorry to
button

04:30:19.830 --> 04:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
you you've now piqued my interest
 
04:30:24.550 --> 04:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
04:30:36.640 --> 04:30:37.910 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
yes

04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
the one line is all there is and the
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
only change in the amendment
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
was to
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
add at the end of the sentence at point
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
of sale
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
so that it's clear that what we're
 
04:30:53.830 --> 04:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
talking about is the bag you get when
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
you buy
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
your groceries or your cosmetics or
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
04:31:03.269 --> 04:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment says and
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's where we are
 
04:31:05.840 --> 04:31:08.309 align:start position:0%
that's where we are
representative

04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
so we are talking about single-use paper
 
04:31:13.439 --> 04:31:15.750 align:start position:0%
so we are talking about single-use paper
bags

04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
bags
 
04:31:15.760 --> 04:31:16.469 align:start position:0%
bags
so

04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
if there was if there's paper bags for
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
sale at the store other than single-use
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
paper bags how would you differentiate
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
you say that again
 
04:31:31.269 --> 04:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
well since we decided that this this
 
04:31:31.279 --> 04:31:32.229 align:start position:0%
well since we decided that this this
bill

04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
only limits the distribution of
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags and single use
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
paper bags
 
04:31:41.110 --> 04:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
is there if there's
 
04:31:43.110 --> 04:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
paper bags available at the store that
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
are other than single use how would the
 
04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to understand your
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
so at the point of sale
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying if there are paper bags
 
04:32:00.560 --> 04:32:01.510 align:start position:0%
you're saying if there are paper bags
there

04:32:01.510 --> 04:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:32:03.510 --> 04:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
available that are not
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
um single use is that correct that's
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
true um
 
04:32:08.319 --> 04:32:09.830 align:start position:0%
true um
so

04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:12.790 --> 04:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
i you know i i'm trying to understand if
 
04:32:16.229 --> 04:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
there's even anything that exists a
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
paper bag that exists that isn't single
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
use intended for single use
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i get single use paper bags at
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
some places and i reuse them
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
but they're not intended to be a
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
multi-use they're intended it's like
 
04:32:33.910 --> 04:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know i i shop at a grocery store if
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
i get a single-use plastic bag
 
04:32:40.469 --> 04:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's i i reuse that but it's not
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
intended to be
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
multi-use it's only intended to be
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
single use
 
04:32:46.319 --> 04:32:47.269 align:start position:0%
single use
so

04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:49.110 --> 04:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd have to
 
04:32:49.120 --> 04:32:49.990 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd have to
have

04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'd have to be aware that multi-use
 
04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
paper bags are
 
04:32:56.319 --> 04:32:57.110 align:start position:0%
paper bags are
are

04:32:57.110 --> 04:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:32:57.120 --> 04:33:05.910 align:start position:0%
are
available

04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
this this amendment
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
as has been pointed out um
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
while we are talking about single-use
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
plastic prospects so
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
this amendment the only thing it changes
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
from the bill
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
is the words to customers
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
from that to at point of sale that's
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
really what the discussion should be i
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
think the and or
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
single use and so on should be more for
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
i think we should just discuss whether
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
or not the at point of sale and i think
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
that this amendment was just to clarify
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
because there was a lot of confusion
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
during the
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
the public hearing um when it said two
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
customers was it if customers bought
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
leaf bags or customers bought hefty bags
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
in a box and so on so this was just
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
talking about the the bags that
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
are given at a point of sale and i think
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's all this amendment really
 
04:34:02.070 --> 04:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
talks about the bill itself does talk
 
04:34:04.709 --> 04:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
about the and and the single use etc but
 
04:34:06.310 --> 04:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
the only change from this to this is
 
04:34:06.320 --> 04:34:07.269 align:start position:0%
the only change from this to this is
those

04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
very very words at the end
 
04:34:11.910 --> 04:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
two customers versus at point of sale
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
and i think the at point of sale is the
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm clarifying so regardless of how you
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
feel about the bill
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
to pass the amendment would at least do
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
clarifying and then however the bill
 
04:34:25.830 --> 04:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
turns out it turns out
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair representative klee
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
hit my point
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
did you have a comment um
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
i i just don't understand that they have
 
04:34:55.600 --> 04:34:58.551 align:start position:0%
i i just don't understand that they have
these

04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
stations set up to collect the plastic
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
bags and they oh sorry come on yeah
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
collect the plastic bags and they're
 
04:35:10.470 --> 04:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
using them for
 
04:35:13.510 --> 04:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
say for example the tracks uh
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
boards that
 
04:35:17.269 --> 04:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
they use for decks and stuff
 
04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
i mean those are extremely expensive and
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we not uh
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
use these uh
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
collection stations
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
more uh
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
frequently than and they know i know
 
04:35:32.629 --> 04:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
it's up to an individual
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
but why wouldn't they be
 
04:35:37.830 --> 04:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
used more often than not you know i mean
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
if if they're promoted for right even at
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
the transfer stations they could put a
 
04:35:47.590 --> 04:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
10-yard dumpster or an 8-yard dumpster
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
there specifically for those
 
04:35:50.400 --> 04:35:51.189 align:start position:0%
there specifically for those
and

04:35:51.189 --> 04:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
i think it would be a good
 
04:35:53.439 --> 04:35:54.789 align:start position:0%
i think it would be a good
avenue

04:35:54.789 --> 04:35:54.799 align:start position:0%
avenue
 
04:35:56.551 --> 04:35:56.561 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:09.029 --> 04:36:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
oh boy this feels like deja vu all over
 
04:36:13.439 --> 04:36:15.109 align:start position:0%
oh boy this feels like deja vu all over
again

04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:36:18.390 --> 04:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
um in the last session we had
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
a plastic bag ban bill that was
 
04:36:20.400 --> 04:36:21.750 align:start position:0%
a plastic bag ban bill that was
essentially

04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
the same as this one except that it was
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
not enabling legislation it was a
 
04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
statewide ban on the use of single
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
plastic bags
 
04:36:30.639 --> 04:36:33.670 align:start position:0%
plastic bags
um

04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is fundamentally different because
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
it's just enabling the fact of the
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
matter is that
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
cities and towns could probably do this
 
04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
already if they wanted to it just would
 
04:36:48.789 --> 04:36:48.799 align:start position:0%
make it easier when interacting with
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
retail outlets if there was something in
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
statute that enabled them to do it if
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
they so ch chose to do it
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
we are not talking about instituting a
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
plastic or paper ban
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
bag ban
 
04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
we are simply talking about allowing
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to choose to go that
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
route if their voters wish to do
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion yes
 
04:37:15.279 --> 04:37:17.429 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion yes
representative

04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate for me to call the
 
04:37:19.039 --> 04:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate for me to call the
question

04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:37:20.400 --> 04:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:24.070 --> 04:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate but i may not choose to
 
04:37:25.590 --> 04:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh correct it
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
live to call the question okay
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
i i hear you but i want to make sure
 
04:37:32.629 --> 04:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
that we have completed our discussion on
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
this this is a
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
rather controversial can be
 
04:37:35.920 --> 04:37:40.310 align:start position:0%
rather controversial can be
controversial

04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.320 --> 04:37:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:37:41.189 --> 04:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know i drive around quite a bit
 
04:37:43.600 --> 04:37:45.029 align:start position:0%
i don't know i drive around quite a bit
and

04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
i think in
 
04:37:47.600 --> 04:37:48.310 align:start position:0%
i think in
all

04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i i just don't see these plastic
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
bags causing
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh so much pollution and things like
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
that i mean we had someone last year
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
police from the the river
 
04:38:00.639 --> 04:38:01.670 align:start position:0%
police from the the river
um

04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
i think i saw one
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
in a tree in the wintertime
 
04:38:06.879 --> 04:38:08.070 align:start position:0%
in a tree in the wintertime
one

04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it boils down to the fact that
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
people are basically responsible you
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
have some that are irresponsible and
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that are going to
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
pollute with these plastic bags
 
04:38:21.119 --> 04:38:22.470 align:start position:0%
pollute with these plastic bags
but

04:38:22.470 --> 04:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know maybe increasing the fines on
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
them or something like that maybe an
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
alternative than then putting a border
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm putting a an order fin that it's
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory to use plastic bags
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
i don't uh i don't think that this isn't
 
04:38:39.189 --> 04:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
mandatory this is enabling sorry
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
this is not mandatory on anyone
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
you have to i'm sorry mr question
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:47.760 --> 04:38:48.551 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
sorry to be so formal but we
 
04:38:50.719 --> 04:38:51.990 align:start position:0%
sorry to be so formal but we
we

04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
lose our
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:39:00.320 --> 04:39:01.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
with with due respect this is not a
 
04:39:03.680 --> 04:39:05.830 align:start position:0%
with with due respect this is not a
mandate

04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
it was the mandate in the last session
 
04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
that went down in flames
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
this is enabling legislation it's simply
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
a if you want to
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
you might consider
 
04:39:19.590 --> 04:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
but it is simply not a ban
 
04:39:26.310 --> 04:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.510 --> 04:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:39:29.429 --> 04:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
it's on the way to the
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
next session you get a ban on it you
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
know what i mean
 
04:39:35.429 --> 04:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
so why even open the door now
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know is what i'm getting there
 
04:39:38.480 --> 04:39:39.350 align:start position:0%
you know is what i'm getting there
uh

04:39:39.350 --> 04:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
we had a comment is it representative
 
04:39:41.760 --> 04:39:42.708 align:start position:0%
we had a comment is it representative
wrong

04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to address mr
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
piamonte's concern um i i think we
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
we have to look at the bill at the face
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
value it's enabling legislation i voted
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
against the statewide ban
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
04:40:00.550 --> 04:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't think i i i i'll pretty much
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
bet this would never fly in merrimack
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm not going to assume that i know
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
better than other communities
 
04:40:10.470 --> 04:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
other communities in merrimack 2 we have
 
04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of responsibility on solid waste
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
management and we have we spend a lot of
 
04:40:17.510 --> 04:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
money on solid waste management
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we hear in testimony how sometimes
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
these bags cause expensive repairs on
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:40:27.430 --> 04:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
the sorting machines and stuff
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
merrimack would probably absorb that
 
04:40:31.030 --> 04:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
repair cost but there might be a town
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't i want them to be enabled
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
to make this decision if they want to if
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
they don't want to like my town they
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
won't but it just it's enabling
 
04:40:39.520 --> 04:40:41.030 align:start position:0%
won't but it just it's enabling
legislation

04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
i and i you know i want to reiterate
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to be careful about
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
presuming that we know what's best for
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
other for communities i think they know
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
what's best for themselves
 
04:40:54.080 --> 04:40:56.628 align:start position:0%
what's best for themselves
representative

04:40:56.628 --> 04:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the things that came up in
 
04:41:01.510 --> 04:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
testimony was that portsmouth has i
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
believe it was portsmouth has in fact
 
04:41:04.080 --> 04:41:05.430 align:start position:0%
believe it was portsmouth has in fact
enacted

04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
04:41:05.440 --> 04:41:06.230 align:start position:0%
enacted
a

04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:41:06.240 --> 04:41:07.350 align:start position:0%
a
bag

04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
bag
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
ruling about what kind of bags they can
 
04:41:12.628 --> 04:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
use and they did it
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
knowing that they were way out on the on
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
the you know tippy end of the branch and
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
maybe there was not statutory authority
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
to do that so what this does is
 
04:41:25.350 --> 04:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
gives those communities which wish to do
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the statutory authority to do so
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um two responses one
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
to representative piermantes the
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
recycled decking plastic decking
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
that each community has chosen how to do
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
their recycling if it is a single stream
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
these plastic bags can contaminate the
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
stream and the whole recycling
 
04:41:56.878 --> 04:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
stream and the whole recycling
of

04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
bulk is rejected
 
04:42:02.708 --> 04:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
and some communities do sort it and
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's more expensive but it
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully cl you know gives them a
 
04:42:07.520 --> 04:42:09.350 align:start position:0%
hopefully cl you know gives them a
cleaner

04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
cleaner
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
stream of recycled plastic and these
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
single use plastic bags
 
04:42:15.600 --> 04:42:16.390 align:start position:0%
single use plastic bags
do

04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
lend itself for that particular
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
recycling and vermont our neighboring
 
04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
state vermont does that
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
this is an enabling legislation gives
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
each community to
 
04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
choose how they want to do it in
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
nashville we have a mixed stream and we
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
have you know we've been doing recycling
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
curbside but mixed stream has created
 
04:42:41.920 --> 04:42:42.788 align:start position:0%
curbside but mixed stream has created
some

04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:42:46.868 --> 04:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
issues because the recycled material is
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
being rejected because of some mixed
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
especially the plastics and don't
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
put everything in one
 
04:42:55.600 --> 04:42:56.868 align:start position:0%
put everything in one
so

04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
i think this at least helps
 
04:43:03.430 --> 04:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
each communities to be responsible for
 
04:43:04.470 --> 04:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
ways solid waste
 
04:43:08.070 --> 04:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
and also i want to bring people's
 
04:43:08.080 --> 04:43:09.270 align:start position:0%
and also i want to bring people's
attention

04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
to online support and oppose i know it's
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
a small number but 118
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and 11 in a
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
position so there is a need or at least
 
04:43:27.030 --> 04:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
the citizens have spoken to some extent
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
in my view thank you
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you additional comments
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
04:43:35.830 --> 04:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
i know this is going down on a limb but
 
04:43:35.840 --> 04:43:37.110 align:start position:0%
i know this is going down on a limb but
uh

04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
would you consider
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
the plastic bags that
 
04:43:47.430 --> 04:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
well i use them to put dirty shoes in
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
so again i'm getting used no they're not
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
well i i do believe that
 
04:44:10.868 --> 04:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
plastic bags that bread comes in are
 
04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
single-use bags and they are at the
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
point of sale so that's not what we're
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.628 --> 04:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
my last comment is that
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
the mixed stream issue is definitely an
 
04:44:29.910 --> 04:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
issue and i know in my community
 
04:44:32.708 --> 04:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
these types of bags in your
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
recycling buckets
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
what happens at the recycling center
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
they reject the entire bucket and they
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the community gets an up charge
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
every time that happens
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
04:44:50.550 --> 04:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
locally is the
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the factory stream as i'm told
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
is these bags get
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
caught in the in the crunching phase if
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's the right term and they jam up
 
04:45:03.750 --> 04:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
the machines so i am
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to that whole issue of mixed
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
streaming and and
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
making the communities pay more
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
because of the mixed stream that's not
 
04:45:16.560 --> 04:45:17.590 align:start position:0%
because of the mixed stream that's not
well

04:45:17.590 --> 04:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:45:17.600 --> 04:45:19.190 align:start position:0%
well
supervised

04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
supervised
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
on the other hand i i still haven't
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
reconciled in my mind how two
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
communities side by side
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
relatively the same size let me use
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
londonderry and hudson they're about the
 
04:45:33.510 --> 04:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
same size communities
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
if one town has
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
a restriction as voted in the
 
04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
restriction for plastic bags and
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
paper bags but the other town said no we
 
04:45:45.510 --> 04:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
what does that mean for the business
 
04:45:48.560 --> 04:45:49.510 align:start position:0%
what does that mean for the business
of

04:45:49.510 --> 04:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:45:51.910 --> 04:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
that those two towns are competing for
 
04:45:54.310 --> 04:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
what will we be driving
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
customers to hudson if if londoner takes
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
the the option or
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
and that that's a concern that i have
 
04:46:05.750 --> 04:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
when we when we leave it to be enabled
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
like this
 
04:46:07.040 --> 04:46:08.868 align:start position:0%
like this
is

04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:46:11.110 --> 04:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
we may see businesses
 
04:46:13.750 --> 04:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
be being caught
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
at a disadvantage because their
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
community is going to choose how to
 
04:46:20.470 --> 04:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
disposition these bags whether it be
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
plastic or whether they be paper
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative davis so there is
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in the statute that dictates
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
what businesses might need to do or not
 
04:46:31.440 --> 04:46:32.470 align:start position:0%
what businesses might need to do or not
do

04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:46:34.628 --> 04:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
if if a business in a neighboring
 
04:46:36.628 --> 04:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
community just to
 
04:46:38.550 --> 04:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
go with your example
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
decides not to
 
04:46:42.788 --> 04:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
ban these single-use bags and the
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
neighbor next door does
 
04:46:45.990 --> 04:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about what the
 
04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
businesses in that community have to do
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
they can go along they can decide not to
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
use single plastic
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
bags anyway it's a private business the
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
state doesn't tell them what to do
 
04:46:58.638 --> 04:47:00.150 align:start position:0%
state doesn't tell them what to do
true

04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:47:02.550 --> 04:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative power thank you mr
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
chair to be clear this this bill be well
 
04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
can i speak to the bill or the amendment
 
04:47:07.760 --> 04:47:10.150 align:start position:0%
can i speak to the bill or the amendment
uh

04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:12.868 --> 04:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
have we made a motion on the amendment
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes we have so just please talk to the
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
amendment at this point
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
so speaking to the amendment that would
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
limit my comments to the
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
phrase at point of sale is that correct
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay so i will defer once again
 
04:47:35.590 --> 04:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay i think uh yes representative
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
i just um i could i could understand the
 
04:47:42.390 --> 04:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
chairman's point about the uh the stream
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
issue i can i can see that
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
but my question is the practicality of
 
04:47:51.430 --> 04:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
how this could be implemented
 
04:47:51.440 --> 04:47:53.110 align:start position:0%
how this could be implemented
because

04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
if you have two convenience stores
 
04:47:56.080 --> 04:47:57.590 align:start position:0%
if you have two convenience stores
conv

04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
conv
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
to me grocery stores are not an issue
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
people people bring their own bags to
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and so
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
paper and plastic is no longer a big
 
04:48:08.080 --> 04:48:09.350 align:start position:0%
paper and plastic is no longer a big
deal

04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
deal
 
04:48:10.550 --> 04:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
to me
 
04:48:10.560 --> 04:48:11.350 align:start position:0%
to me
but

04:48:11.350 --> 04:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:48:13.750 --> 04:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
convenience store when you just bop in
 
04:48:16.230 --> 04:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
and get two or three items
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
and if they say do you want a bag okay
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
they don't give you an option
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
of paper or plastic they say do you want
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
a bag okay and in most cases the bag
 
04:48:30.628 --> 04:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
that they offer you is a plastic bag
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
they don't offer you paper and plastic
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
so a convenience store
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
to me it would would really be hit on
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
this because they have to offer
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when people go into a
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
convenience store they're not going to
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
bring their own bag you know you're
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to just go in and pick something
 
04:48:51.920 --> 04:48:52.628 align:start position:0%
going to just go in and pick something
up

04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:48:55.110 --> 04:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
and and if there are too many items to
 
04:48:57.510 --> 04:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
carry out you're going to need to put it
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
in a bag so what kind of bag are you
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to put it in well
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
from a practicality standpoint
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
convenience stores are going to want to
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
offer plastic bags because they take up
 
04:49:11.910 --> 04:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
less room and they're cheaper and
 
04:49:11.920 --> 04:49:12.948 align:start position:0%
less room and they're cheaper and
everything

04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:49:12.958 --> 04:49:14.070 align:start position:0%
everything
so

04:49:14.070 --> 04:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how
 
04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
if a town a municipality
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
said no more plastic bags
 
04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
were done with plastic bags so how could
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
that be implemented in a convenience
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.520 --> 04:49:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:49:43.350 --> 04:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.670 --> 04:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
to address representative lasalle's
 
04:49:45.680 --> 04:49:46.788 align:start position:0%
to address representative lasalle's
point

04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
i i think that language in the amendment
 
04:49:51.670 --> 04:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
that talks about regulating the
 
04:49:54.550 --> 04:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
distribution i think that general enough
 
04:49:57.510 --> 04:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
that a town may make a decision
 
04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
that if if they are
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
going to let's say
 
04:50:02.160 --> 04:50:03.430 align:start position:0%
going to let's say
require

04:50:03.430 --> 04:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:50:05.750 --> 04:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
grocery stores to
 
04:50:08.628 --> 04:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
um ask if if a customer wants a bag in
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
the first place or if they're going to
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
say no plastic bags at all they could
 
04:50:14.550 --> 04:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
exempt convenience stores there's
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
nothing in this that says that it's
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a blanket regulation i think
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
it gives them
 
04:50:21.190 --> 04:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
to decide okay we're going to regulate
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
the distribution
 
04:50:27.910 --> 04:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say for everybody it
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
could just be for stores of certain size
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
very similar to what's already in
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
statute if you look at
 
04:50:34.240 --> 04:50:35.670 align:start position:0%
statute if you look at
one

04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:50:35.680 --> 04:50:36.310 align:start position:0%
one
n

04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
n
 
04:50:38.070 --> 04:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
regulating noise
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
in merrimack anyway
 
04:50:43.110 --> 04:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
we don't ban noise we do regulate it for
 
04:50:45.510 --> 04:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
certain hours
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
and you know so some businesses it might
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
create a lot of noise at night they're
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
they're out of luck but
 
04:50:52.080 --> 04:50:53.030 align:start position:0%
they're out of luck but
um

04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
towns have a lot of different noise
 
04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
ordinances so i would expect that
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
you know adding item q about the bags
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
there could be a lot of different
 
04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.030 --> 04:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think i'm going to move the question
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
we've had plenty of discussion
 
04:51:15.360 --> 04:51:16.310 align:start position:0%
we've had plenty of discussion
and

04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
if my memory serves right which it might
 
04:51:22.230 --> 04:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
not we're at the point where we have
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.160 --> 04:51:28.868 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:51:31.270 --> 04:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
and uh that that the motion is off the
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
path amendment after we had to uh adopt
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh so the motion is to adopt the
 
04:51:40.830 --> 04:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
