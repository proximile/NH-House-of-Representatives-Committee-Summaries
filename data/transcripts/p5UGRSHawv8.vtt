gr representative Lon um I I guess I

mostly wanted to say thank you for
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
coming back for this hearing just so we
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
can make sure that if there was anybody
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
who wasn't part of the conversation they
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
have a chance but wonderful work thank
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
you thank you it was a very interesting
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
um study in how to draw a
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
Weber and my understanding Mr chair is
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
that we now have passed out um
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
1198 which is where the source of my
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
confusion was which is repres
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and
 
00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:31.990 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and
representative

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
gr's further effort on this and then
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
there is one small further tweak that
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for so I wonder if it
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate at this point for
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative gr also to talk about the
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
differences between
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
0908 and 199
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
1198 just so that all of the people who
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
are here who are interested have a
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
chance to hear those differences and and
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
weigh in if they choose to do so sure
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so during the um
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
the last hearing on this bill there had
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
been concerned about the kind of
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
medication that AA could administer in
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
relationship to injectable M injectable
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
medication and of most concern was
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
injectable medication that would be
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
drawn via VIA a a vial so something that
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
has to be determined and measured by the
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
administrator of the medication it was
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
agreed by the commission and by the
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee the at hog committee and all
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
those involved that indeed that could be
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
something that is that a call up would
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
be prevented to do so they would be
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
um for example use medication that is
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
that is already though the where the
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
syringes are dose such as EpiPen and um
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
but things that had to be drawn for a vi
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
from a vial would not be allowed so the
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
language that representative uh Merchant
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I had come up with is on page two
 
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.150 align:start position:0%
and I had come up with is on page two
line

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
32 where it says the Adit the criteria
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
for the administration of non-injectable
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
medication in the process of
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
approving and then again um line
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
35 colon medication administration shall
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
be limited to non- injectable medication
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
unless self medication is self-
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
administered so when we reviewed this
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
with the with the committee the issue
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
was that um criteria for the
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
administration of non- injectable
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
medications it has to do with the
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
administration of all medications not
 
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
just non- injectable ones because
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
epipens would be considered injectable
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
and then Administration shall be limited
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
to non- injectable medication unless
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
such medication is self-administered
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
well the whole purpose of this um bill
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
is if medication is not
 
00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:18.759 align:start position:0%
self-administered so we um asked that we
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
take those two um words out of the
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm sorry I keep looking
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
at my phone because the house Community
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
Services Community Services is printing
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
up my the amendment yes just just thank
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair just for clarification what
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
what the amendment that is being
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
prepared does is it simply strikes the
 
00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:44.509 align:start position:0%
prepared does is it simply strikes the
word

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
noninjectable and self in two places no
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
no it correct it it on line 32 it takes
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
out non- injectable okay and in line in
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
line 36 it takes out self administered
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry thank you very much for
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
that sure and then just to be sure that
 
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
rule making is parallel to statute we
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
are adding that part to rule making and
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
just the same exact line is being put in
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
the rule making which is
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
be it is there's a rule making section
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
that was added to this because we need
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
rule making and in that Ru making that's
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
where that Clause is put so that the
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
rules clarify as well the rules and the
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
statute duplicate each

about it medication shall be limited to
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
self-administered medication not
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawn from a vial that language is
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
also on line six um and then it's
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
mirrored in the ru making and the ru
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
making Authority is lines 30 through 36
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
on page two of this and my question was
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
if you were looking to um standardize
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
that language it sounds like um it
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
sounds like they still won't be
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
standardized between the two um
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
because you sounded like you were
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
removing self administered from page
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
line 36 are you removing it from line
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
six as well yes I am actually in my yes
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay perfect and then the non-
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
injectable is removed on both both page
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
32 I don't see self injectable on oh no
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
non injectable is is is okay on line 35
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
but we're we're repealing it on line 32
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes other
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative Palazo thank
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you to for taking
 
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
my question uh coming back to to the
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
intent of this amendment we already have
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
very complex system with many positions
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
that require certification and uh it
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
looks where adding kmer a new position
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
making system even more complex so can
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
you briefly talk why you think uh this
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh added complexity is justified by
 
00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:49.710 align:start position:0%
uh added complexity is justified by
added

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
benefits if I understand your question
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
you're asking you're asking why this
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
position is um is being request Reed in
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
line of right because the Assisted
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
Living fac so in
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
um in facilities where people are being
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
cared for there's different levels of
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
care and assisted living facilities have
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
the least they they Al obviously have
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
regulations but they are the least um
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
regulated of All Care Facilities because
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
the people there are capable of taking
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
care of themselves
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
um is considered a home for them and it
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
could be that they are there because
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
they can no longer drive or there are
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
many reasons why they're there um but
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's not nursing care and so they do not
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
have nursing staff
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily but they do have dedicated
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
people who are capable of helping them
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
with Administration with the
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
administration of medication and this is
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
a position that's been created for those
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
individuals um they would have to though
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
take um a nurse a nurse a medication
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
class which is similar to the class that
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
lnas get it's a 40-hour class and and it
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
was and it's been it would be
 
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
administered and put together by the
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
Nursing representative Merchant thank
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you represent gr for
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
question the intent behind
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
self-administered medication was the
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
fact that when I heard during testimony
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
they want to be able to use an insulin
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
pen and insulin pens of
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
self-administered so that's kind of the
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
root of the word self- administered
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
there are things like Auto injectors and
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
things of that nature that phys a
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
patient can use to self- administer but
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony from the
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
Residential Care people sometimes the
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
patient doesn't have the dexterity to do
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
the self- administration so someone has
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
to do it on their behalf so that was
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
where the Genesis of self administ came
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
from um and I think one of the thing I'm
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is that not withdrawn
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
from a vial helps to protect someone
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
basically at that point in time taking
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
something out of a vial like in a
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
hospital if you have insulin it's done
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
by two people um injectable medications
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
are problematic if they're not done
 
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
correctly that's my concern so again
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
back the same thing is that if it's in a
 
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
auto injector a pendant injector and so
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
forth those are things
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
designed to be self- administered but
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
back what I said before if the patient
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
can't do it because of dexterity
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
problems arthritis and so forth it still
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
allows the person to assist that
 
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
patient well by putting unless the
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
medication first of all we all agree
 
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
that any medication taken from a vile
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
cannot be done by a comma that's
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
something that is agreed by everyone
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
in and if you put in self admin unless
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
if you put in self- administered
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the person who's we the reason why
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're they need the comma is that they
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
can't they can't do it themselves so by
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
putting that in you're limiting the what
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
the um comma can do and also know that
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
this is going through Ru making this is
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be the end of the but by
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
the end of the conversation but by
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
putting it in here you limit the um
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
ability to Define what the comma can do
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that's I think that should be
 
00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
decided for by the Board of Nursing and
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
the um uh Assisted Living folk and the
 
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.950 align:start position:0%
the um uh Assisted Living folk and the
Nurses

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
Nurses
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
Association and
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's representative pmer and then
 
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
that's representative pmer and then
representative

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
Weber so I just wanted to say why I
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
think this is a very important bill the
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
number of times I've been stuck in the
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
hospital not being able to discharge a
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
patient because there's no one available
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the assisted living facility to give
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
medications taking up a bed in the
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
hospital over the weekend having this
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
poor person sit in the hospital exposed
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
to all of us um so I really think this
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
is a kind of critical um piece in the in
 
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.029 align:start position:0%
is a kind of critical um piece in the in
the

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
puzzle representative Weber and then
 
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.510 align:start position:0%
puzzle representative Weber and then
representative

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
Lon so so my question is um and I'm
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
really very glad that representative
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
Palmer gave us the broad scope here
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
because what it sounds like to me that
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're discussing here with the
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
Amendments is a teeny tiny
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
piece and if I'm understanding
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
correctly everybody agrees that um
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
anything that has to be drawn from a
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
vial or mixed or anything is completely
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
out of the question the only thing we
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
are trying to do is make it clearer or
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
at least give Ru making Authority yes
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
sir so that if a patient has a
 
00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:16.710 align:start position:0%
sir so that if a patient has a
onetime

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
onetime
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
premixed ready to go
 
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.950 align:start position:0%
premixed ready to go
self-administered

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
self-administered
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
medication already in a container like
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
an EpiPen or but with whatever they need
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
that if they do not have the physical
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
dexterity in their fingers that the
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
calma would be able to help them with
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
the administration of a medication that
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
has no mixing or dosing or determining
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
it's just there and ready to go and are
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
we and and that
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
that the the rules for that would be
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
done by Ru making where the people who
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
job it is unlike ours most of us to
 
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.669 align:start position:0%
job it is unlike ours most of us to
administer

00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
administer
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
medication will have the input as to the
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances as to how that happens is
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct and well
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
said Thank you and and I just wanted to
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
say thank you to everybody who's here
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
who has worked on this because I know
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's been an incredibly long
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
slog and um we'll keep working thank you
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and then
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative pushman um thank you U my
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
question question is about the this
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
parsing of the language if we have the
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
language in your Amendment and then
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps if the committee report
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
expresses some of those specific
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
concerns about how we craft it would
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
that give us sort of the direction and
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
the flexibility in Jael car to make sure
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
that they're appropriately protective
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
and to put those that into rules as
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to statutes yes I know that as a
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
member of jail car public comment and um
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
is all part of the packet that we get
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
and you can believe I'll be looking for
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
that representative pushman and then
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um can you tell me how this um
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm just trying to think how
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is going to work with um say a
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
patient who has on sliding scale insulin
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
and they have um a pen that you need to
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
turn the knob on is is that something
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to be permitted through
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
this certification or not not
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily no CU that's a whole
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
different thing okay you're talking
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
about a dial pen a dialing pen yeah no
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
not necessarily I mean that's sort of in
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
between the drawing up of the vial and
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
the EpiPen where everything is preloaded
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
so that may not may or may not be I
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't know okay so this is pretty much
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
only pre-filled auto injector one time
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
well that's the one that everybody
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
agrees on that's correct okay thank you
 
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.230 align:start position:0%
agrees on that's correct okay thank you
representative

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.990 align:start position:0%
representative
Weber

00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
and I was just going to ask isn't it
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
true that if we actually manage to vote
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
this today and get it to the house floor
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
and get it through the house it also has
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
to go through the body that we cannot
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
mention so if people are concerned that
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
there is more clarification needed we
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
have not one but two opportunities one
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and then the rul making so
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is to keep it moving
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
get the ru making authorization which
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like it's there but if
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
there are people who are not comfortable
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
with it we still have another
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work on it you mention
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned 30 lashes with a wet
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
noodle uh representative Paz off uh
 
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh can you help me
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
with amendments so we have hearing on
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
specific Amendment but we have two
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
amendments in front of us and did I
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
understood correctly that there's yet
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
another amendment being printed so
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
what's your preference do you want us to
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
adopt all three amendments in the order
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
they were received or can you help me
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
well there are the First Amendment um
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
would be fine to adopt it's up to you
 
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
you know 1198 would be fine but that was
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
the one that doesn't really discuss
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
injectables uh the Second Amendment 1198
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
discusses injectables but it's rather
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
strict and it's not something that um
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
would give a lot of leeway to the
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
rulemaking so the Third Amendment which
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
is the one that has my name and
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's name on it is the
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
one that I would prefer you um adopt
 
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.830 align:start position:0%
one that I would prefer you um adopt
but

00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's your bill you know I so but I hope
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
that you will consider the input that I
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
represent the 26 people put together
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:18.919 align:start position:0%
position an amendment I'm waiting it's
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
like watching a baby getting born right
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
you're thinking is it ever going to come
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
out Mr chairman yes representative
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
Merchant are we since we're not going to
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
exact on this until maybe later could we
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
then at that point in time move this to
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
um except wait for the amendment to come
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
in later not we can't I mean again this
 
00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:42.039 align:start position:0%
hearing is only on the non-gain
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
amendment not all of the Amendments uh
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
so much of what we're talking about is
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
fine but it's really the focus is on
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
0908 because that's the non gerain
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment did I answer your question by
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
the way or so basically we have to have
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
a hearing on the next Amendment no no
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay no this is the only hearing we need
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
so therefore what I'm trying to because
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know how long it's going to take
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
for ol us to get to us if we could
 
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.110 align:start position:0%
for ol us to get to us if we could
representative

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
Weber having
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
had a hearing required on the non-gain
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
amendment that some of us don't think
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
wasn't needed but uh we have two tweaks
 
00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:26.519 align:start position:0%
um either of which or or both of which
 
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
can be introduced our executive session
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
but we don't have to have another
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on those they're they're very
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
close to what already happened so um and
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
and it's up to the chair but he may want
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
to take up bills in certain orders
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
depending on the people who are in the
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
so yes representer
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
Shapero I have a question of the chair
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
since this is um this is a hearing that
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
seems to be somewhere between a hearing
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
and an executive session with discussion
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if there are other
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
people who are going to speak at the
 
00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
hearing and if we should kind of move on
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah if we if we don't have any more
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
questions for representative groda um
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative go thank you I just want
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
to make one more comment I'm
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
sorry I originally there was no there's
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with the First Amendment
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
with the non gerain amendment that we
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
are having a hearing on now 1198
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
we can certainly add rule making and the
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
other components to it in the other body
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
and and I would certainly support that
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
um but as soon as we get that other the
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
third amendment as soon as we get the
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
amendment from the one that's from
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and I I will make
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we have it that you all have
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
it okay but I would encourage the
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
committee to give the rulle making as
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
much Authority as possible thank you
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%

00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:00.919 align:start position:0%

welcome back uh we are now going to open
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
the executive session on several bills
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
and in deference to our guests lining
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
the the walls of our committee room uh
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
we'll start off with uh hb1 1568 FN uh
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lon do you have a motion
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr chairman I move in study and
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
after a second I'll speak to it
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative palaza do you have a
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
second I second representative Leon uh
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um this I
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is a really pressing
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
problem of unreimbursed care for
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patients um and I recognize
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
it's also complex and challenging some
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that we probably would
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
need to address would be whether the
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
response originated through a 911 call
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
or some other way so that we can
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
understand and have an idea on what is a
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable one to reimburse as opposed
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
to somebody coming over for something
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
quite trivial and wasting your time um
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
that the patient's consenting to the
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation um that there's an agreement
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
that the person doesn't need to be
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
transported I think there's a whole lot
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
of things that need to be addressed and
 
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
fortunately for us we're not the only
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
people who have been looking at this
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
topic and um it I expect to see a bill
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
that actually deals with this in a much
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive way hit our committee
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
very soon as um that there's uh some
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
pretty full agreement over that other
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
body about a much more elegant solution
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
to this problem and rather than the fact
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
that we weren't able to really have an
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
idea of how to approach it and they've
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
put together something wonderful I think
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
is a good reason for us to move interim
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
study on this bill and excitedly look
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
forward to getting to work once it comes
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
over to us um it' be senville 409 looks
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
really good and it's uh 70 out of
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
Finance after it had passed a Voice vote
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
in the Senate so this isn't punting the
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue um um I just think it's I think
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
that they've have a better start and we
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
should move to that work instead
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant who was the
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
second it please um representative Paz
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
off thank
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman I'm I'm very
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
glad that we all support this in theory
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
um my position is
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
that I am not understanding why this
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
bill which is very simple and in my mind
 
00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:01.349 align:start position:0%
bill which is very simple and in my mind
very

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
clear um has been infused with a lot of
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
confusion and difficulty and it's all
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
complicated I don't think it's
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
complicated I think the bill does
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
exactly what's needed and for that
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
reason I will be opposing an uh interim
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
study and um hoping to move something
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
else thank you representative Shapero
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh from from what I know about Senate
 
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.390 align:start position:0%
uh from from what I know about Senate
Bill

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
409 um I would agree with representative
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
Leon that that one is maybe more
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and more um detailed um
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
and and will give us better guidance
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
moving forward but at the same time in
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
principle this this bill 1568 which is
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
very simple and lets us allows us to
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
take a stand saying that we support
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
um for um Emergency Medical Response
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
um this is a this is a policy that we
 
00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
can um endorse here and now and both
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
bills will end up in finance committee
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
and um I would I would think that
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
um I would think that
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
we understanding that the finances
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
this bill have not been well vetted um I
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
think as a policy decision we can agree
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
to support this and send it ahead to
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
finance committee and that um let others
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
deal with the intricacies um so I would
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
also um not vote for a interim study but
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
vote for um vote vote in order vote
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
against interim study in order to make
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
another motion and support that thank
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
you other discussion representative Lon
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um I I'm not
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
really in the business of passing
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
messaging I try and pass bills that
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
actually will achieve what we're looking
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
to do the details were so sparse on this
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
that this wasn't even a second committee
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
bill because there was no way to get a
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
handle on what the cost would be um I
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
fully support all of our First
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
Responders I just want to make sure that
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying um yes we support
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
you so we'll push this through we'll
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
look to something that's a very
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive one that we can all get
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
behind and so there can be some clarity
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
so that um everything is directed a
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
little bit closer and we can get this
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
done sooner rather than later um by
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
doing that other
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%

motion

00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeahman yes uh thank you Mr chair um
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
so looking at uh at this legislation um
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
the reason I think I'm going to support
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation is because I think what
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
it does is it is it puts forth a kind of
 
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh a minimum standard uh for for patient
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
care and informed consent and I think
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
that um if you look at the provisions
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
that are in the legislation um it's a
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
very low lift so we're very fortunate in
 
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
this committee to have a lot of uh
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
healthc Care Professionals um who are
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
part of our our our team here and I
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
think if they ask the question of
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
themselves is there anything that is
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
contained in this uh that they would not
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
want to do um no I think they would all
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
say yeah this all of the stuff that is
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
contained in here kind of makes sense
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
and I said it's it's kind of a minimum
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
bar so as I said it's it's it's a pretty
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
low lift so the question for me anyways
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
when I was considering you know where to
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
go with this is is it necessary though
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
to to put it in the statute and I think
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
my answer to that question is yes
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
because I think if you look at the way
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
that healthc care has progressed in the
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
last 30 years um you're seeing a
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
development of of a very very broad um
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
administrative uh infrastructure and I
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
think that kind of changes uh the way
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
that that Health Care is delivered now
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
in contrast to the way it was delivered
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
30 years ago I I think of myself you
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
know 30 years ago when I was engaging in
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
a healthcare profession I had a very
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
different experience than I did now both
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
with respect to follow-up care with
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
respect to the kind of discussions uh
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
that that I would have um with the
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
doctors um and you know in contrast with
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
that um I was down in
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
Brazil and I had a pnea thorax and so I
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
had to go in and I had to receive care
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
in Brazil and the amounted I didn't
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
speak a word of Portuguese really so
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
they had the doctor and the doctors
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
didn't speak Portuguese there were all
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of discussions and all through the
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
process and after the amount of
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up care was just incredible and
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
when I look at a couple years later I
 
00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:43.799 align:start position:0%
had a hernia surgery here in the United
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
States there was nowhere near that level
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
of discussion and and even when I was
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
asked it just really wasn't available to
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
me and the same thing I encountered you
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
know with the follow-up care so I asked
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
myself the question um
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
if I look at Brazil's doctors and nurses
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
and and the doctors that we have now
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
versus the ones 30 years ago are they
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
better in Brazil are the doctors from 30
 
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
years ago better than they are now no I
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
don't think so I I think healthc Care
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
Professionals today are just as
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
committed as they were in the past uh
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
they have a sense of mission they have a
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
sense of person uh purpose and they're
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
they're patient centered but they have
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
this administrative infrastructure that
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
has grown up now in healthcare and what
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
that administrative infrastructure I
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
think tries to do is it tries to treat
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
Health Care as a process and once it
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
does that it looks for efficiencies and
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities to introduce lean and I
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
know this because you know I'm an
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
engineer and that's what I would like to
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
do with my processes but I think it's
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
very hard to introduce the concept of
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
lean to a discussion between uh a doctor
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
and a patient I mean sometimes it's
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a f minute discussion
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's going to be a 30 minute
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and when I talk to both
 
00:51:08.789 --> 00:51:08.799 align:start position:0%
patients and doctors I hear from both
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
sides um there's some frustrations about
 
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
the limitations around that and so again
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
do you need to have something coming in
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
from the outside necessarily in the form
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
a statute and as I was thinking about
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
that I thought back to the early
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
environmental movement and I remember
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
back being a kid growing up going to the
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
reversing falls and just looking at the
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
pulp effluent coming down the river um
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
and all the smog that was in the air and
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
there needed to be an outside influence
 
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
to kind of move that I think maybe the
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
environmental movement has gone a little
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
bit in One Direction but the intention
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
when it when it first started off was we
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
need to bring in an outside influence to
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
kind of move things back towards the
 
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
center and and I see I see that that's
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
kind of where this legislation has value
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
because it does kind of set from the
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
outside from statute that minimum
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
threshold that you have to maintain it's
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
a very low bar um that I don't think
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
most health care providers would object
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
to and it's a I think going to be a
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
valuable tool both for patients and for
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals and so um I
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
hope everybody will support
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
it representative kushman did you wish
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
to speak to do your motion um I don't
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
really have anything to add to that I
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
think uh representative McLean um
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
presented it perfectly thank you thank
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
you representative U TZ and then
 
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.710 align:start position:0%
you representative U TZ and then
representative

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
Mel uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
representative McLean because I think uh
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
reminding us of the administrative
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's been growing and
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
some frustrations and limitations is
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
part of what's been happening with
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and this bill has absolutely
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with an ability to impact
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
that um this bill is introduced without
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
any evidence of the need for it it would
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
be administratively burdensome it's the
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
standard practice of care as much of the
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
physicians in the room have already
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
explained and the way you improve
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is not the legislation there
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
are many many means by which to try to
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
make things better both um within each
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
individual uh practice organization or
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
overall uh you know as a sort of um the
 
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine as a whole with
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
guidance and all that and I think that
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
if I had Clarity on any evidence that
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
there was a need for this I might feel
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
differently but as someone who does
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
teach quality improvement and um has
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
worked in you know trying to improve
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
health for a very long time I I really
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
am scratching my head about this and um
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
would definitely be voting against it
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and then
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
representative Lon thank you Mr chairman
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
um I agree with both of you um if I can
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
do that we don't understand how you can
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
do it now I have to explain it I'm not
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to say it without explaining I
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
mean I superficially I thought that this
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill was a waste of time for the every
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
reason you just said I mean everything
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
that's in here we already have to do
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's however we've seen a what we
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
call Corporation or invasion of the
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
medical industrial complex into healthc
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
care where within the next 10 years
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
we're all going to be employed by a
 
00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
corporate entity of some sort I see this
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill as a protecting not just the
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
patient but the doctor from that and I
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
will share an example with you yesterday
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
I had nothing better to do in my o time
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
than to look at inform consent that we
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
were requiring the patient to sign and
 
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
that I had to sign too and um these are
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
brand new hot off the presses designed
 
00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:45.559 align:start position:0%
by the uh risk management people with
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
very little input from the doctors and I
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
looked at this thing and I said this is
 
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
an absolute joke I said I can't sign
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
this in good faith so what we did was
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
with every patient I saw all 12 of them
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
I had to go through it and cross that
 
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
out cross that out cross out this
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply that doesn't apply add
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
other stuff by the time we got done what
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be a 20 minute visit
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
turned into a 45 minute visit and that's
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing now is risk management
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
people designing these these things and
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
that is just totally wrong what we need
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
to do is go back the clock 30 years and
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
and and do what we did 30 years ago we
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
actually explain things to people and
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
not let people in Risk Management Do It
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
full for us and I think that this bill
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually protects doctors for the
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
longest time I tried really hard to come
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
up with a reason and not vote for it and
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
I am going to vote for it for that
 
00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
reason thank you representative Le okay
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.630 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
primer

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
primer
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
so I I think that I started off with
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
this same thing which is that it's kind
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
of redundant since we basically follow
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
the same things what I'm afraid of is
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
that instead of corporate medicine
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
telling us what to do this the state
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
will tell us what to do which and I
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
don't who's making the rules here and
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
who's going to decide I mean so there's
 
00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:13.109 align:start position:0%
who's going to decide I mean so there's
line

00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
um 15 C it and it says the burdens risk
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
and expected benefits of all options
 
00:56:21.549 --> 00:56:21.559 align:start position:0%
including foregoing treatment so
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
now I mean I would sort of argue that if
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
you have the corporate medicine they're
 
00:56:26.589 --> 00:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
just going to go there well there's this
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
law we don't want to get sued and who's
 
00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
made the list of all of the op of all of
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
the complications all of the options
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
that need to be documented for this
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
procedure so I mean I'd want this before
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
agreeing to support this I'd want a lot
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
more clarity on exactly how it's going
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
to work and I'm I'm sort of figuring
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to end up being that my I
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
mean I work in the darath hitok system
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that there's going to be a new edict
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
Beyond what we already do with peer
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
review that's going to you know be yet
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
another layer of stuff in in getting
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
consent for anything than we have to do
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
now and it's going to take 10 more
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
minutes and the people who are paying me
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
aren't going to give me any more time to
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
do it they're going to expect that it
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
gets done and if it takes if I can't
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%
leave till 8 o'clock at night now
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
admittedly I don't do a lot of
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
procedures so it's not as big a burden
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
for me as it will be for a surgeon but I
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
I would only support looking at this
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
further I wouldn't support passing it
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
today representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm really having a hard time
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
with this discussion so this is directly
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
from the American Medical Association
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
from their ethics this is what is
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
required of doctors today our
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
administrative rules say that you need
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
to follow the ethics if it's going to be
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
burdensome to comply with this if it's
 
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
going to be different than what's done
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
today when our administrative rules say
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
that you need to follow the medical
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
ethics guidelines from the AMA then that
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
proves just how necessary this bill
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
is representative Parmer
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
so given that we follow the ethical
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines or
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
consent the problem is that the way
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
things work these days in the system I
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
work in is that once you have a new law
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
the lawyers all get involved in that law
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
and they make the the steps that you
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
have to go through to now follow the law
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
the end result should be the same it
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
should be that we are explaining to
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
patients what we're doing what the
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
complications are what their options are
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not arguing that but what I'm
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
saying is that putting it into law will
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
make extra steps it's already hard
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
enough to recruit Physicians to New
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as it is and every one of
 
00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
these little steps um adds to the
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
administrative burden and you know I I
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
can sort of see that that it sounds like
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
I don't want somebody looking over my
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
shoulder and telling me what to do they
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
already are I'm on our peerreview
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
committee at the at the hospital we
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
already watch very carefully what people
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
are doing and um and so does the Board
 
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.230 align:start position:0%
are doing and um and so does the Board
of

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
Medicine I just think that putting
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
putting it into a law without for me
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
without sort of more clarity about how
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to work and how we're going
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
to avoid unintended consequences of
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
making Physicians lives just more
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
difficult without actually making things
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
safer for
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
patients thank you other
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
discussion rep representative
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
mlan representative Merchant had his
 
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
hand up first sorry representative
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
merchin thank you Mr
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
chair one of the things I looked at is
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
in the patient Bill of Rights which
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
deals with residential facilities and
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
also hospitals deals with most of this
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
so there could be a question about a
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
conflict between that Bill of Rights and
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
this try to create another Bill of
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
at constraints um in essence if you're
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
taking care of a patient and you don't
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
have informed consent there are
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
standards that are going to have to be
 
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.789 align:start position:0%
standards that are going to have to be
met

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
met
 
01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
you have insurance companies will be
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
breeding down your neck if you don't
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
meet those standards called liability
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
you can get sued um so I think it's
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
self-governing we don't need to have a
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
statute to enforce the standards that
 
01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
are out there whether it be Joint
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
Commission whether it be AMA um there's
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
enough in the marketplace now that's
 
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
enough in the marketplace now that's
going

01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
to protect the patient from that kind of
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
activity and to have redundancy in the
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
statute and when you put in statute it's
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
very difficult to change so things down
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
the road and come up we you want to
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
change things you can't go through Jael
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
car and Ru making to make the
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
modifications will allow you back to the
 
01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
legislative process so for all those
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
reasons I think the intent has Merit but
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
I think having something in statute
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with this is an Overkill thank
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
you other discussion representative
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
Nagel I'm just offering a solution I
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
mean we're hire in all these quote
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
position extenders or whatever term we
 
01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
want to use for nowadays you know when
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
my son had his surgery done in Colorado
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
the doctor spent two minutes with us and
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
he was brilliant I mean my son had a
 
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
horrible fracture and the guy did
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
amazing job but he only spent two
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
minutes of it with us and 30 seconds of
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
it was spent telling us how wonderful he
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
was then you know and in the end he was
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
so it was great but but his his
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
physician assistant spent 30 minutes
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
with us doing this at a substantially
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
lower cost to both the hospital the
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
system and us and we got all the care we
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
needed we got all the questions we
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
wanted answered and I'm struggling
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
because at least in my practice they
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
don't do that and I said well why are we
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
hiring you that's the point I mean I
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
don't see that the doctor needs to
 
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily do this you have other
 
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
people within your office that can do
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
that but we've had several bills come
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
before us where patients are saying
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
they're not getting this and that's
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's the impetus Behind these bills
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
coming forward like the circumcision
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
Bill and you know the other bills there
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
was another bill in there also
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
and and I see I'm not I I'm going to get
 
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
in trouble saying this but I see this
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
every day where in that two-minute visit
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
patients aren't getting this and and
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
they have the right to get it they're
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
paying a lot of money now between
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly High deductibles incredibly
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
High co-pays and time away from work and
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
this and that and the other come see the
 
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
doctor and then they don't get this
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
information and I I I it's a really
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
troubling thing to me and I don't like
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
the idea of putting in statute either
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
but we a stand has to be made that we
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
got to stop doing that the you know
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
we're here for you people are paying for
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
our services they are customer we are a
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
provider of a service and they have the
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
right to have that heard and if this is
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
the only way it's going to get done and
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
that this momentum in the wrong
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
direction is needs to be stopped and
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
fine that's that's why I'm supporting it
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
I it took me like well I don't know when
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
you brought the bill up but I mean I
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
remember one of the lobbyists and I
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
looked at it say why is this a bad Bill
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
we couldn't figure out why and um you
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
know but I came around to the thinking
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
that it's it's unfortunately needed and
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
and issues that happened yesterday which
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
is why I'm kind of like ticked off right
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
now but issues that came up yesterday in
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
my practice this finally just said
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
something's got to get done
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lon and then
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative TZ um thank you Mr
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
chairman um so the patients Bill of
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
Rights was brought up that is not
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
binding on providers the patients Bill
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
of Rights is for the licensing it is for
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
the facilities so the patients Bill of
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
Rights doesn't impact what the providers
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
have to do it does throughout the
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
contracts and that sort of thing we have
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
another bill today that I'll be
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
recommending for inter room study
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to tell the doctors
 
01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
what to do within the facilities
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
language for patients Bill of Rights so
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that that any
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
protections we put in are actually
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
impacting the group of people who are we
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
we are attempting to speak to so we
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
can't speak to Physicians directly
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
through the patients Bill of Rights and
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
second I don't know how this is bizarre
 
01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
world in some places the party you
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect to be the free market
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
one is pushing for it here I feel like
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
um the you know one party has
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
traditionally been for The Underdogs and
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
here we are fighting for The Underdogs I
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
know I've always been for The Underdogs
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
but I don't know why we're not putting
 
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
patience over systems and I think that
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
this bill puts patience over systems
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative tez and then
 
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.630 align:start position:0%
representative tez and then
representative

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.190 align:start position:0%
representative
Shapiro

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr CH I um I think there's
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
a few things I think uh representative
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
Nagel I think you need to have some
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with your
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
co-workers um because as an organization
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there's some you know
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
like improvements that could happen
 
01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
based on your own observations that
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're sharing with all of us here I
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
would I would add that if we really want
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
to incentivize improved care there's
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
many other ways to go about doing that
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
we could say um we we we have
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
a a a survey where we assess uh patient
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
satisfaction with you know the process
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
overall like being informed
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
understanding the process of consent you
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
could incentivize that at at
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
organization levels and then
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
organizations would work together to
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
figure out okay do I add a extender an
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
educator or do because right now burd
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
putting the burden on the um provider in
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
the encounter where as representative
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
Palmer pointed out you're still going to
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
be expected to only see the patient in
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
20 minutes which basically means it's
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
going to be an even crappier job excuse
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
me for my uh blunt language if now
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
there's more administrative burden to
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
doing what is already happening which as
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative Mel explained it's about
 
01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.670 align:start position:0%
representative Mel explained it's about
the

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
conversation and as also representative
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
Murphy has described it's about the
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
relationship so you have a relationship
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
you have a conversation and this is
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
introducing a lot lot of um
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
administrative complexity that again the
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
lawyers the administrative types are
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to it's just going to create a lot
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
of additional burden that is not
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to improve patient care
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
it is going to make everything a lot
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
harder and I've seen no evidence of
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
anything where this is
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
beneficial representative Shapero and
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
then representative work Mr chairman
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
could I assert a point of personal
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
privilege please sure okay I really
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
resent the characterization that this is
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
one set of people prioritizing patients
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
over systems and another set of people
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
prioritising systems over patients you
 
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
may believe that that is the result but
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
I think that you have attributed motive
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
to a whole bunch of people in this room
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
who are very concerned about patience
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
patient care patient rights and we have
 
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
reached a different conclusion and so I
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
think that the assertion that one set of
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
people is defending systems and not
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
patience is completely uncalled for and
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the P privilege I
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
apologize I did not mean the offense
 
01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
that came from that I just need I want
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
us to make sure that we understand who's
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
at the root of each of these choices and
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
and I do understand that what we're
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
looking at is we're discussing the
 
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
results not the
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
intent representative Shapiro and then
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant yes I I would
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
just like to takey back on what
 
01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
representative Tes said um which is that
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
informed consent in my mind is really
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
about a relationship a conversation it's
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
something that um probably many
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
providers are not that good at we're not
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
trained in that well um and it's also
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
affected dramatically by the um changes
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
in health care and the speed up and the
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
productivity demands I think there's
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of things that are
 
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.030 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of things that are
broken

01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
broken
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
um you know personally I'm not you know
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
although it's been broadly categorized
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
as people are hearing from their
 
01:08:40.269 --> 01:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
constituents that this is a problem this
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
is not the problem that I'm hearing
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
about and I hear about a lot of problems
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
in medical care um but I think this
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
is maybe one of those things that's more
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
of an art than a science that some
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
Physicians some medical people are very
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
good at I I don't see this as a solution
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
to um the problem of people not having
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
the time or not having the ability to
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
have um delicate sensitive
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
conversations um with people about what
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
their care is going to entail I'm also
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
concerned specifically
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
um line 9 through 10 about assessing the
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
patient ability to understand what we're
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
talking to them about um which of course
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
is part of the responsibility of every
 
01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
provider you don't want to just talk to
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
people and
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
um regardless of whether they understand
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
what you're saying or not um so um any
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
any provider I think would be have that
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
in back of mind but I think this
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
particular language opens providers up
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
for um lawsuits I mean like how does one
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
assess that someone fully understood
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
what you were talking to them about do
 
01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
they have to get a
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
um you know in some cases if someone has
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
dementia do they have to get some a
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
specialist in in dementia care to figure
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
out if they understand and I think just
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
the specific language uh is a concern to
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
me because
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
um it kind of creates the expectation
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
that a provider um in the course of a
 
01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.310 align:start position:0%
that a provider um in the course of a
short

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
conversation and let's face it we don't
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
have time for extremely long
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
conversations um is going to be able to
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
fully assess whether someone comprehends
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
um all aspects of that informed consent
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity this bill is written
 
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to apply to Physicians
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
insurgents but there's no reference to
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
the same issue with natural paths um Nur
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners and dentists um oral
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
surgeons they also have the same issue
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
um if you want to talk about it that way
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
so I think about the narrow scope we're
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
talking about one type of health care
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
provider and not talking about other
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
people that we possibly could have the
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
same issue with number two when you
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
start looking at the issue here this is
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
coming from my own experience I know
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
some wonderful wonderful surgeons that
 
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
technically are phenomenal me I would
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
trust my life to them anyone's life to
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
them they're just phenomenal surgeons
 
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
but they may not have the best bedside
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
manner so trying to regulate bedside
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
Mana which is a sensitivity which is a
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
lot of what this bill is all about I
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
think is going the wrong direction um so
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
therefore what I'm trying to get to is
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not being comprehensive we're
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
taking one type of healthcare provider
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
and trying to have that informed consent
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
apply to them only when there other ones
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
out there could be just as devastating
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
if not more
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
so and also looking at and saying is
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
that if we're talking about trying to
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
control bedside behavior and
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
insensitivity interaction with the
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
patient I think it's more like someone
 
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
said an art and the science and we have
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
to allow for that flexibility and try to
 
01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:07.229 align:start position:0%
to allow for that flexibility and try to
legislate

01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
it uh representative King King thank you
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I'm very curious about what
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Nel has been talking
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
about um my question for you is do you
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
find that
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
um there because time constraints and
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
money and issues like that that um that
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a perverse incentive not
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
to provide as much um um informed
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
consent because you know if you were to
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
really spend the time not necessarily
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
the doctor but maybe your staff were to
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
really spend that extra time that you
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
know you're able to see less patients as
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
a result which means less income for the
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
firm and if you know that your
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
competitors so to speak are cutting
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
corners on that that they are going to
 
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
get a greater market share in the long
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
run and so um you know this happens a
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
lot in all sorts of Industries you know
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's like for example we don't let you
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
know athletes take steroids because if
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
we do let if we let a few of them take
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
steroids then the rest in order to
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
compete with them we're going to have to
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
take steroids too and so it's sort of
 
01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
like a race a race towards a really bad
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
outcome and I'm just wondering if you
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
think that part of the reason why so
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
many don't give the informed consent
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
that they should
 
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.510 align:start position:0%
that they should
is

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
because they just know that they've got
 
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
to keep up with expectations and how
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
much money they have to make and if they
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
knew that there was a Level Playing
 
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
Field that okay I can spend the time
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
with the patient that's necessary to get
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
them informed consent because I know
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm not going to lose
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
market share by doing that is that does
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
that make any sense am I thinking about
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
this correctly thank you um I I'm going
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
to probably plead the fifth a little on
 
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
this one but I I you know I can speak
 
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
for me I can't speak for everybody else
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
um I've been very fortunate in my career
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm in a private practice I can do
 
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
what I want nobody's ever told me um
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
what I have to do um my wife is a nurse
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
practitioner and um I've seen what
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
happens when um certain entities take
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
over practices she's been in and how
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
things change dramatically um however my
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
wife's probably the most God wonderful
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
people I've ever met in my life um my
 
01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
wife is always stuck to her guns and her
 
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
morals and it has cost her jobs because
 
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
she takes more time than other people do
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
and that bothers me a lot um with that
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
said um you know I I've always included
 
01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
the informed consent from every visit
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
from the beginning we start to the the
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
minute we end so the education goes to
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
the entire time and I spend a lot of
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
time with people but I'm like really
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
lucky I also kind of was on the ground
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
floor of creating a procedure that
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
generated an awful lot of Revenue that
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
paid me an awful lot of money so you
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
know it's not like you know over 37
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
years so it's kind of like I'm not any
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
the right person to ask I can't speak
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
for other people I don't know why they
 
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
do what they do um I think what
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative merchin said some of it's
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
just personality one of my best friends
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
right now um when I first arrived he was
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
one of the most prominent doctors in
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
state and um he um he had a reputation
 
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
for a horrible bedside manner but he
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
amazing surgeon and um
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
um you know patients really couldn't
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
stand talking to the guy so I got to
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
talk to him a couple months or I don't
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
know it was like two years ago and he
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
looked at me and he says Dave you go
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
since you said crappy I can say this um
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
um he said I was really a prick wasn't I
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
and I go yeah yeah you really were and I
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
said but that's all right because you
 
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
use people around you to help convey the
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
information you weren't doing and and so
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going off on a tangent on what
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
you said but um to answer your question
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's up to the individual you do
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
what you think is right if you bow to
 
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
pressure that's you have to live with
 
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
that that's all I can say representative
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
kushman and then representative mlan
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so most of the
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
concerns here are kind of moot because
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
this is again already in administrative
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
rules so any legal concerns that are are
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
being raised about attorneys are going
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
to start looking at it and then you know
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
that where were they because admin
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
ministrative rules have the force of law
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I mean this is a very simple bill
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
that supposedly Physicians are already
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
doing and it's just putting it in
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
statute so that we have it concrete so
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
if the AMA changes and says you don't
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
have to provide informed consent at all
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
in their ethics which is very unlikely
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
but it's in statute and it's it's the
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
standard for our
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
physicians um you know it it's already
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
there it's it's clearly workable
 
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing preventing doctors from
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
using their power of Delegation to carry
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
this out there's nothing preventing a
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
standardized form from from offering
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
this um required information to the
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
patient and as long as there's you know
 
01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for feedback and questions I
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's very simple it's very
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward and it's doable and it's
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
already expected so I'd appreciate um
 
01:17:20.189 --> 01:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
your support thank you representative
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
mlan and then representative Leon thank
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um as as a lay person but
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
as a patient um I look at this and I
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
think this is a pretty light lift I I
 
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
look at it and I think that this is
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually just the floor and I I
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
understand and I respect you know uh and
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
I kind of agree with representative
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
Merchant's comments about you know the
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
fact that this is not you know fully
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and and and I acknowledge
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
that but I I don't think we want to let
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know the perfect be the enemy of the
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
good and you know we can can always come
 
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
back in in the future and and add to
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
this but I think you know in spite of
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
the the the good work that that
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative tez is talking about
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
that's being done I think just look at
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
the evidence around us we are on a
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
trajectory where things are becoming
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
more and more and more perfunctory in
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
spite of all those best efforts and so I
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
think you know we're at a place where
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
the the time is here to say we need to
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
have an outside push and that's what
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
this provides you know and I'll go back
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
to the example of the environmental
 
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
movement you don't want to go back we I
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
worked at a coal generation uh facility
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
back in Canada and we had these
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
electrostatic precipitators but the cost
 
01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
of using them was very high well an
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
outside agency came in and said you're
 
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
putting too much stuff up the stack and
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
these are this is the rule change well
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
guess what they fired up those esps like
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
no business there comes a point in time
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
when you've got 30 years of internally
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
trying to push it in a Direction but in
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotally in my experience as a
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
patient I'm not seeing it and the
 
01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
discussions I had with other people
 
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
they're not seeing it and if it was
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
going up and down up and down and
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
seawing okay maybe but it just seems to
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
be this so you have to introduce
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
something from the outside and that's
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying cuz I'm not a fan of
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
going the statutory route myself but I
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
think there has to be an outside impetus
 
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
and that is I guess that's what I'm
 
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
asking the folks maybe potentially
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
reconsider thank you very much
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lon and then
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um thank
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
you and M as well um thank you Mr
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
chairman in 2009 I broke my leg
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
skydiving I broke my femur um an
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
uncomplicated only a femur fracture my
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
first stop was at a hospital in New
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where they told me that I
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
needed to consent for surgery the next
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
morning they couldn't tell me what
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
procedure they were going to do they
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't tell me what surgeon it was
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
going to be and they wouldn't let me
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
wait until I met the surgeon because
 
01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
they were going to have to already be
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
putting me under for the surger surgery
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
before I had a chance to meet the
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
surgeon I know a little bit about
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgery and so I knew that
 
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
depending on what kind of procedure I
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
had was going to dictate the rest of my
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
life quite frankly between limb length
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
differences and everything else I had
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
enough knowledge to get myself out of
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
that hospital and have myself filmed for
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
a procedure for somebody who had
 
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
invented one of the intermediary nails
 
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
so not everybody gets that opportunity I
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
Pro I I don't know if I'm the only
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
person in the state who was told you
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
need to consent to this even though you
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't know what the procedure is that's
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
what I was told I was told that I was
 
01:20:47.629 --> 01:20:47.639 align:start position:0%
going to be denied care for at least a
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
day if I didn't consent ahead of time
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
happening it shouldn't be happening
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
and it really should be simple to put
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
this into statute so that hopefully that
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen in the
 
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
future okay representative wber defers
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
to representative freedus I'm sorry
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative frus I didn't see a hand
 
01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
up thank you chairman for here letting
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
me speak um I'm wondering in this what
 
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
is the patient
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility I have have had several
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
procedures done one in which the office
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
gave me a video to watch and watch the
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
whole thing when I finished watching
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
that I thought I don't think I want to
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
do this there were too many suggestions
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
of what the results might be or whatever
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday I met with a physician's
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
assistant and I bet I talked to him
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
about 20 minutes new relationship but
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be an established
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
relationship right away so I guess we
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
need to trust that our relationships are
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
going to get us the information that we
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
need and that we have access to
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
information on our own
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
is thank you representative
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
Weber so my comment was just without
 
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
wanting to stifle anybody's debate um I
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
wonder if we could all consider among
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves whether continuing to say what
 
01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
is basically the same things again and
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
again is going to result in a change uh
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
or not or or or whether we should
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps proceed to a vote but I also saw
 
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
I believe I saw representative McKay's
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
hand and he has not spoken yet so uh I
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
certainly I I just call upon your
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
thought processes it's lovely to debate
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
each other but if if I thought things
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
were changing I would not have made the
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
comment representative McKay would you
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
like the last
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
word thank you Mr chairman I'll be very
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
brief uh I've been on this committee for
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
a very very long time I've always
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
opposed any
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
prescribes practice of any kind licensed
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
um I was a licensed clinical social
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
worker I I don't want the
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
legislature uh telling me if I was still
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
in practice how to
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
practice and this I don't see that this
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
is NE necessary I think of Physicians um
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
already know what's best for the patient
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
and are going to tell them what they
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
need to know and and not what they don't
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
need to know I've had some recent uh
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
encounters with my with several doctors
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I was complaining to myself that
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
why aren't they telling me what I need
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
to know now I know what they didn't tell
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
me what I needed to know because now I
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
know it and I can deal with it now I
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
couldn't have them I I think that
 
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
physicians's U uh practice is being
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
invaded by this kind of legislation and
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
we've seen it over and over again over
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
the years and therefore I'm opposed to
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
you all right uh representative t as I
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
enlisted something new I'd like to move
 
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
to the vote yeah uh thank you Mr chair a
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
little bit new I um have spent over 20
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
years of my life trying to improve
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
health care quality and access and
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
making things better um I am a family
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
doc we very much value and I think there
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
are some differences by you know
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
specialty as far as temperament
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
personality and maybe bedside Manner and
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
how much time you spend with patients
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
but in general I think we care
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
fundamentally about patients um patient
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
centeredness their autonomy their
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
ability to make decisions and good docs
 
01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
currently in like who are trained now
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
are trained to think of it as we're
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
there to be almost like a coach right
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
the decision is yours we provide
 
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
information we support you um and even
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
with that appreciating that this is
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
current you know should be just the
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
practice because it's the guidance I I
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
agree um with the point that was raised
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
previously that there are some things in
 
01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:25.719 align:start position:0%
here that for example assessing patients
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
ability to understand you know we are
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
all of us if you were all my patients
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
I'd have you know 30 different
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
experiences we all have different levels
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
of Education we have different levels of
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
experience um 40% of the US population
 
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
has low health literacy that includes
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
everybody not just people who are very
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
low educated that means the ability to
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
understand and use the information and
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
the instructions resulting from the
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
health encounter Healthcare is
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
complicated and complex and so like
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
ideally Physicians take all of that
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
especially since we're just pointing out
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
Physicians here they take all of that
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
into consideration and we're conflating
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
here what I think is bedside manner
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
patient education and understanding of
 
01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the thing is and then
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
specifically informed consent which
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
tends to usually be more about
 
01:26:20.189 --> 01:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
procedures a surgery a you know fixing
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
my broken leg and I think that is my
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
concern because
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
is it you can't just you know you can't
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
just standardize everything the same
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
like Health Care depends on continuity
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
good healthare depends on continuity on
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
relationship on building the trust the
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
understanding the sharing of information
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
and supporting patients to make their
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
best decisions their choices not just
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
telling them limited information and so
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
again uh I have a lot of concerns about
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
just in general everything the approach
 
01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.109 align:start position:0%
just in general everything the approach
to

01:26:52.109 --> 01:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislating uh what is already uh good
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
practice as opposed to finding other
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
ways to incentivize Improvement in
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
healthare overall thank

um interim study
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
because I think there is concern my
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
concern would be how often is this
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
happening how much of a problem is it
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
and if it is a problem then maybe maybe
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
we need to look at this more but I I
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
would that's what I would support you're
 
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.560 align:start position:0%

motion believe there's an amendment I

01:30:52.920 --> 01:31:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:52.830 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%

e

01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
sure we've got a bunch of Senate bills
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
meet this is the last these are the last
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
house bills yes they all have to be done
 
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:12.669 align:start position:0%

today

01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we we uh because of the
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
difficulty of these bills we we
 
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
continued them as long as we could but
 
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
the deadline is now so
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant did you want to
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
make a motion about to pass on this or I
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
do but given the fact it is a relatively
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
long Amendment um whether to delay
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on this amendment to a little
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
bit later another go to another bill if
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
we can so people can digest I be helpful
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
time all right so we'll uh we'll take up
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
1300 later on we'll leave it till the
 
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
end if that that
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
works um how about uh hp5 1585
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you want to
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
talk about that
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
one are you ready for that one actually
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to representative
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
Merchant on that one um and I know that
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
he has an amendment on that one as well
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
but it is a less onerous Amendment and I
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
would also ask Mr chairman I I noticed
 
01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
that the prime sponsor of House Bill
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
1300 is here so I wonder if we could
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps take that up after this one so
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have to sit here all all
 
01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm we can be flexible on
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
that so representative Merchant I when
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
back um and last night the amendment on
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
1300 was emailed out to people it was it
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
was sent to the
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
Gary the 1300 amendment was emailed out
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
last night just so you know to the
 
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.550 align:start position:0%
last night just so you know to the
committee

01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
members okay so representative Merchant
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
did you want to make a motion on the
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
amendment for 1585 I'll make a motion I
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
to pass okay and just to clarify this is
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh I know there's a number of amendments
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
floating around on this it's a it's
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
2024 1246 h
 
01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.669 align:start position:0%
2024 1246 h
1246

01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
way I'll second okay and and
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
seconds okay representative Merchant
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the critical piece
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
that was changed um it's more for
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
clarification than anything
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
else after working with uh
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative grer and other folks um I
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
think this is a little more clarity to
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
it if you look at page two on lines 3
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
through six what I trying to get to now
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
is that many of the injectables come in
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
what they call self- administered Auto
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
injectors pen injectors things to do
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
with insulin and so forth Etc so the
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
intent is be sure that we're not drawing
 
01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
from a vial but the device that's being
 
01:35:20.109 --> 01:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
utilized is actually filled by the
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer not somebody else so it's a
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's a safeguard it's really trying to
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
be sure that you're in the residential
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
care facility you have somebody's being
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
trained but when you get into injectable
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
medications my concern is that that's
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
where a lot of mistakes can happen so to
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
minimize that possibility by having
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
pre-filled um as a self injector you
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
basically help the patient put to pen to
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
the body if you will push the button
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
basically auto injector so what this
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill Amendment does to the bill under 3
 
01:35:54.669 --> 01:35:54.679 align:start position:0%
through six and also underline 35
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
through 37 is to clarify that so that's
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
all it's doing it's just being very
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
clear we're talking about Auto injectors
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
and not talking about um something
 
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
else representative L did you want to
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
speak to you a second or uh no I think
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
we've discussed it pretty well okay
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
representative um Shapiro and then
 
01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:17.669 align:start position:0%
representative um Shapiro and then
representative

01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
TZ I just have a quick question I have
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
um three amendments from the original
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill or at least they have part of one
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
and two full ones so are we is the
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
suggestion to um adopt all three
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendments or two of them or just the
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
last 46 just the last one okay for
 
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
representative we they're all amendments
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the entirety they have little tweaks
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
and so there's no need to adopt more
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
than one and
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
um I will thank you let representative
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
Merchant go on speaking C representative
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
T has had a hand up thank you I I just
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
had a question so I I listened to um the
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
prior hearing and heard the discussion
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
about the um why we uh don't want the
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
colas drawing up their own meds but what
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
about or are there other instances where
 
01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
maybe a pharmacist or a a privately
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
licensed level nurse could be filling a
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
syringe with the a correct amount of
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
medicine and leaving it to be
 
01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
administered by the comma um it's
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
possible although the way the bills
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
written in all the Amendments so far if
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's drawn from a vial that's prohibited
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
so whether the pharmacist does it
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
whether somebody else does it and gives
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
it to the calmer um that would in my
 
01:37:43.709 --> 01:37:43.719 align:start position:0%
opinion not be
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
permissible I mean I know that's how
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's written but that's why I'm asking
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
would we want to allow it if if you had
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
the appropriately credential an
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
experienced person doing it correctly
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
but leaving it so the person could
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
administer it should we allow
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
that representative Weber did you have
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
something to add to this or I'll
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
clarify I I would only comment that this
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
bill has been the subject of yeah about
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
six months worth of
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
meetings and what you are discussing is
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
something that a level of discomfort was
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
expressed throughout consistently
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
throughout those meetings for multiple
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
multiple parties so while it might be
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay my sincere hope is that this bill
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
now represents what all of these people
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
are comfortable with and yes there may
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
be things in the future that we need to
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
add but my sincere hope is that members
 
01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
of this committee would agree on this
 
01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
amendment which is the best that has
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
come up yet move things forward
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there will be more
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
discussion in a place I cannot mention
 
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
but mention anyway and further
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
discussion under rulemaking which is now
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
included specifically in this amendment
 
01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:20.679 align:start position:0%
and and so this gets us further forward
 
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I I don't want to let the perfect
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
for one be the enemy of the good for all
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
I get it thank
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Shapero I just
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
want to say quickly that um probably a
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
year ago representative Weber and myself
 
01:39:44.669 --> 01:39:44.679 align:start position:0%
got an email or call from our County
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home administrator suggesting a
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
bill like this and it it ends up it
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
didn't even apply to nursing homes but
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a long long circuitous journey
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I give a tremendous amount of credit
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
to all the people who've worked on it
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
and I think we've come up with something
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
good and that we can feel really good
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%

01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
chair this came to us um from
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
a fellow representative and the intent
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill is that there are times in
 
01:44:13.589 --> 01:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
which a patient may not be able to get
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
into a clinical trial or be able to
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
utilize certain things that are out in
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
the marketplace would be a biologic drug
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
a device and so forth under
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
compassionate use so this is really
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
modeled more after the federal law um to
 
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
allow it also to occur within the state
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
law so it does two things one is it
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
allows the opportunity for patients with
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
the advice of the physician to utilize
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
things that may not be in the normal
 
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
course uh Capac use and so forth and
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
number two given the fact that this is
 
01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
going into that Arena it provides a
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
certain level of protection to the
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
provider so therefore the provider if
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
they're willing to work with the patient
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
on this and they're agreeable to it
 
01:44:54.669 --> 01:44:54.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to provide some level of
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
protection to the provider going into
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
uncharted waters that have been fully
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
validated through through scientific
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
studies and evidence and so forth but
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
there's a intent by the patient who's
 
01:45:07.589 --> 01:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
been informed that this is a possibility
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
to help you to give you an example of
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
something I have a dear friend um who
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
actually has gone to Japan and has spent
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
several thousands of dollars because the
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
treatment that they can get in Japan is
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
not available here in the United States
 
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's an example and he's actually
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
trying to work with people federally to
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
modify certain things to allow for more
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
of this to occur so all this spill
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentally does is allow that
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a patient who's been
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
informed as full consent and also to
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
provide some level of protection to the
 
01:45:41.589 --> 01:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
provider from
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
liability and I want to say thank you to
 
01:45:45.550 --> 01:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
both representative Lon and
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative Nel who and actually most
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
of this Co representative Leons I want
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
to say thank you for a lot of the work
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
you put into it making this uh possible
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
to bring forward representative wayon uh
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you very
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
much representative Merchant for all the
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
hard work you put in it as well and
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh Nagel so our our
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
terminal patient rates try law was
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
passed in 2016 and that was before the
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
federal U right to try was passed um
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
over time it's moved from sort of uh
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
more the compassionate use to more and
 
01:46:17.589 --> 01:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
more following along the right to try
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
pathway and our existing law is in
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
conflict in some areas with the federal
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
law any of these manufacturers of drugs
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
biologics or devices are worried first
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the FDA is going to
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
allow them to continue making their
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
products available so that will always
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
be the first thing that they look to our
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
statutes because they were in Conflict
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
may have been one of the reasons why it
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
was hard to access this I do know that
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
um when people that I know that were
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
trying to place compassionate use they
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
ended up placing it into offices and
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
into facilities in Massachusetts as
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to in New Hampshire when the
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
person was able to practice in both I
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was because of the laws
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
around the right to try or because those
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
institutions were just a little bit more
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
accepting of having these um quite
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
frankly one of them said the person had
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
to go um halfway across the country as
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
well uh so this by standardizing it and
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that our terms are
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with what is now federal law
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
is a good way way to provide this access
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
um it does change it from terminal to
 
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
life-threatening disease because when it
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
was first passed none of this was done
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
on the federal level and everybody was
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
trying to move that momentum towards it
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
the life-threatening disease is a
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
disease or condition where likelihood of
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
death is high unless the course of
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
disease is interrupted or those with
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
potentially fatal outcomes where the end
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
point of the clinical trial that they
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
used to study it was survival so you're
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
talking about that that's just a a more
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
elegant way I believe of saying terminal
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
um and it also points back because we
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that as we focus on
 
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
this um right to try this um this
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
compassionate use we're also not um
 
01:47:58.350 --> 01:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much crowding out expanded use
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
because the the manufacturers can
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
provide expanded use as well which is
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
where the physician U requests access to
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
investigational drug device or biologic
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
and that one's done by an Institutional
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
review board um that otherwise would not
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
be underneath these statutes because
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's a whole different process and this
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
also points to the off label use because
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
if it's available on the market the
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
doctors are already protected from
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
licensing uh Penal
 
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
simply because it's off label we passed
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
that two years ago um and I want to
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank the sponsor for bringing this
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
because it was a harder LIF than any of
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
us thought but I think this actually is
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
a really nice solution representative
 
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant and thank you Mr chair
 
01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
following up on resent Lon um I was
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
initially opposed to change a word
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
terminal to lifethreatening
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
but given the fact that so much has been
 
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
developed in the markets if you will
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
with drug therapy specifically that even
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
cancer today is turning into a chronic
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
disease so it's not terminal actually
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
any disease is terminal ultimately but
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's lifethreatening so therefore you
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
want to change the word from terminal to
 
01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
lifethreatening to allow for that
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
broader interpretation of the law
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I I just wanted to again thank
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsor it was really great that you
 
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
brought this is a really important issue
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
um as of Friday we were in a quandry and
 
01:49:22.109 --> 01:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
we had basically were going to interim
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
study and we felt horrible about that
 
01:49:27.149 --> 01:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
but we felt there were so many problems
 
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
with this language and personally every
 
01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:31.719 align:start position:0%
one of us has a terminal illness it's
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
called life so I I've really I've really
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
struggled with that whole I look through
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
definitions all over the place and I
 
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
didn't really like any of them and I
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
think that was a brilliant way to look
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
at it as life-threatening as opposed to
 
01:49:48.189 --> 01:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
that and um representative Lyon
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
basically put everything we were talking
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
about on paper and you saved the day and
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
that was awesome and I think we have a
 
01:49:56.669 --> 01:49:56.679 align:start position:0%
good bill now representative Weber and
 
01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
Palmer thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
you all for your work on this I too was
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
one of the ones who came to it
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
saying um and and this is one where uh
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
like like the previous Bill a lot of
 
01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:14.149 align:start position:0%
like like the previous Bill a lot of
talking

01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
has uh persuaded me that the guide rail
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
guard rails that are in this bill and
 
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
and the parameters that expressed in it
 
01:50:30.669 --> 01:50:30.679 align:start position:0%
are um are good ones and that um I'm so
 
01:50:33.310 --> 01:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
pleased that we're able to come to a
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
place where I can say yeah we really
 
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing this and and and it's
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
taken me a while to get here but I
 
01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of those who kept talking
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
and kept working because it's a much
 
01:50:47.069 --> 01:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
better place to be
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
in representative Palmer and then
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative mlan so I last last night
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
we we were talking about this and I
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
initially had had significant
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
reservations and then as we were talking
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
I remembered the AIDS epidemic and
 
01:51:04.109 --> 01:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
compassionate use of act and then my
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
grandfather getting Kadin from France in
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
the 1950s for a blood clotting disorder
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
that and I might not have ever gotten to
 
01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
know him if if it weren't for these sort
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
of sneaky ways in of getting treatment
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm now now I'm now I'm now happy
 
01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.189 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm now now I'm now I'm now happy
representative

01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair um you know I I
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
believe in the importance of right to
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
try but the one question I have and you
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
probably already covered it but it was a
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
lot for me to digest is what does this
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
legislation do for us beyond the federal
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and I know there was a lot
 
01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
was kind of thrown at me just a couple
 
01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
minutes ago but could you just kind of
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
convince what what does this do beyond
 
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
the federal right to try representative
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant and then representative Lon
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
part of it that as representative Lon
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
said there was conflict between the
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
federal so the state law can be more
 
01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
restrictive than federal law but it can
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
be more lenient so if we don't remove
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
some of the restrictions we have in a
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
state law to allow for more use at the
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
federal level that's what the Bill's
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
trying to do is allow for the state law
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
to be in constant with the federal law
 
01:52:18.270 --> 01:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
to provide more accessibility because
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
the way the current law is written it's
 
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
more restrictive than the federal law
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative L did you want to add
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
something to that u i if if
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
representative mlan has another question
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
I yeah just just quickly so does this so
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
now from a restriction level we're at
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
par so we are so there's no
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
okay um and and further what this does
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
is it protects those providers who are
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
doing this from any adverse adverse
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
things from the licensing board for
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
doing this so because they're they're
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
regulated by the State Licensing Board
 
01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
we need to make it clear that the State
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
Licensing Board won't come after them if
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing this the appropriate way
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and just some of this other language
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
it was just confusing and conflicting
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
and my husband's helped place um
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
compassionate use of drugs and to have
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
right to try that sort of thing and the
 
01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
way that our statute was written was
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
just really really cumbersome and legal
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
departments just weren't comfortable
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
with it so now by by removing those
 
01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions we have that but we do need
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
to have those Protections in place
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
against the licensing uh penalties so
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
that's why it's important for us to have
 
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
in there well thank you very much for
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
the answer and and all the good work on
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative Shapero
 
01:53:31.950 --> 01:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm in reflecting
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
about this bill I'm kind of
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
thinking about all the debates and
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
conversations we've had about limiting
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
what people can do over the years in
 
01:53:45.069 --> 01:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
this committee and so it's really
 
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
refreshing to have a bill that's kind of
 
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.069 align:start position:0%
refreshing to have a bill that's kind of
expanding

01:53:50.069 --> 01:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
um what people can do and um and all of
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
us have had people close to us who've
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
been in situations where this might come
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
in really handy and so um I'm really
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
glad to support this
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill representative Lon um thank you and
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
I want to thank representative Shapiro
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
and everybody who was here two years ago
 
01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
because we did we expanded access for
 
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
FDA approved drugs devices and biologics
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
through our off label so we had already
 
01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
done that there and if it wasn't for
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative licki bringing to us this
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
to us we wouldn't have realized the
 
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
conflict in the statute so yes we
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes see the rir time of the other
 
01:54:30.669 --> 01:54:30.679 align:start position:0%

01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.119 --> 01:57:55.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I know it's confusing because you
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
it's easy to confuse those two
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
especially where they I sent an
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
transposed do we have one Amendment
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant or
 
01:58:16.069 --> 01:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
two one what's that we'll start with
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
that one just one so 1220 is the only
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
one well 12 no yeah 1220
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
242 20h is the one I'm okay bringing to
 
01:58:37.709 --> 01:58:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
around um any more copies on that side I
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:51.040 --> 01:59:19.950 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:59:19.950 --> 01:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
so I'll make a motion on
 
01:59:27.069 --> 01:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
house amendment to house bill 16007 it
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
would be Amendment
 
01:59:28.639 --> 01:59:30.790 align:start position:0%
would be Amendment
2024

01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
2024
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
122h and I make a motion to repres
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
seconds yes he would you like to speak
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
to your motion yes I would thank you Mr
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
chair I had a very long conversation
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
with represent Celli myself repr majer
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
um also Seth King we had a call and
 
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
based upon that triy to come up with
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
language that we could sort of thread
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
the needle and the discussion was how
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
thick the thread was or how wide the
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
needle was um but we anyways we found
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
something to um settle on in further
 
02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:09.189 align:start position:0%
something to um settle on in further
discussion

02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
I found that there um could be some
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
other situations so I support the
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
amendment but I may depending upon the
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
discussion at the bill level as
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
amended May ultimately change my mind I
 
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
talked to representative Celli about
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
this but the fundamental thing we're
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do I think the intent of it is
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
that when a child is born and the
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
parents particular the mother feels that
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have the resources or The
 
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
Temper whatever the reason they are they
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
want to have the child taken care of by
 
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else that they have a safe
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
place to do it historically it's always
 
02:00:49.069 --> 02:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
been through a handoff warm handoff um
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
part of it though is trying to protect
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
and make this is anous as possible and
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
baby box does that so the parent doesn't
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
actually have to engage with another
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
human being which gives up their U
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
ammity which is concerning um so in
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
essence with the baby box it does allow
 
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
for the child to be placed somewhere
 
02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
safe in a sort of an incubator that is
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
monitored 24/7 so the intent of this was
 
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
to basically say that if you do as a
 
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
parent place the child into the baby box
 
02:01:23.950 --> 02:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
that you will have a certain level of
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
immunity um from Criminal prosecution
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
and part of that is you don't want to
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
have the mother being torn between do I
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
give up my child or do I try to face the
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
possibility of some sort of criminal
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
prosecution for whatever reason so this
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
was a way to try to minimize that
 
02:01:42.910 --> 02:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
tension between the two and say at this
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
point in time if you're willing to give
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
up the child then at that point in time
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
there's a certain level of protection
 
02:01:51.149 --> 02:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
for you so that's what this amendment
 
02:01:52.589 --> 02:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
does um
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make it 100% exclusive I'm
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
not an attorney I wish I was at times
 
02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:02.709 align:start position:0%
not an attorney I wish I was at times
but

02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
well it it would help a lot of times I
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
think a lot of things we get into from
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
the legal ease part of it is
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
that represent of Weber it's it's a it's
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
a tough when you're trying to write a
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
law to understand what the terminology
 
02:02:19.149 --> 02:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
is a lot of it comes into legal ease if
 
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
you will and I'm not really trained in
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
that Arena so it has put me at
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
disadvantage but anyways that's what I'm
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
trying to put forth with the committee I
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
do ask the committee to support the
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
amendment I may not support the bill as
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
amended but I would like the committee
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
to Le support the amendment
 
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:35.589 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
representative

02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
Shapiro as one who went to law school
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
and was told that every word in every
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
statute was a pearl polished to
 
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
Perfection by
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
legislators uh coming here was a shock
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh but even even before I came to the
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
legislature I was a fan of people
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
writing in English that could be
 
02:02:59.470 --> 02:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
understood by uh people who did not have
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
law degrees and I'm all for it um I
 
02:03:04.990 --> 02:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
think with respect to the language of
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment it does make the bill
 
02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
better and I'm going to vote for the
 
02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.430 align:start position:0%
better and I'm going to vote for the
amendment

02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
because uh it it does not address all
 
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
the concerns that I
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
have that arise from the extension of
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
the period of time to 60 days which is a
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
long period of time uh if a child is
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
being abused
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
neglected um or in in some cases
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
beaten um I don't want to get us to a
 
02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:41.790 align:start position:0%
beaten um I don't want to get us to a
point

02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
where that child is put comos in a baby
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
box and uh there are no
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
consequences um
 
02:03:54.910 --> 02:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
I think all of this is pretty attenuated
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
logic but um for various reasons that
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'll get to when we get to the
 
02:04:01.390 --> 02:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill I'm not in favor of the
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
bill I very much in applaud the intent
 
02:04:06.669 --> 02:04:06.679 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's going to do what
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
people want it to do but I will vote for
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment because I think it makes
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
the language marginally better and then
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
we can go on from there representative
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
Shapero okay thank you Mr chairman all
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
this talk about lawyers
 
02:04:26.669 --> 02:04:26.679 align:start position:0%
and U and uh polished pearls and so I
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
still don't understand what this
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
um so um like others have said I have um
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
questions about the underlying bill as
 
02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
well um but I really applaud all the
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
people who worked on trying to parse
 
02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:47.709 align:start position:0%
people who worked on trying to parse
this

02:04:47.709 --> 02:04:47.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
exclusionary um area of the bill um it's
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
kind of like a moral dilemma that
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
there's no good answer to so I I give
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
people an um representative King for
 
02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
starting us off on um exploring how to
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
solve such a difficult dilemma but now
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
that we have a solution I don't fully
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
understand it so um if there is somebody
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
who could tell me does this mean that
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
um that evidence that evidence was
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
gathered through this process cannot be
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
grounds for charges of abuse and
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
neglect well then it says or criminal
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
prosecution so what can it be used to
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
charge someone with representative
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
Weber well first of all I was never a
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
criminal attorney I was an elder law
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
attorney so uh I I think there have been
 
02:05:43.069 --> 02:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings first of first of all
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
it was written in the original bill as
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
an exclusionary rule you cannot use it
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
and this has at least moved us in the
 
02:06:00.549 --> 02:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
direction that it might be used um what
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about with the way the
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill is written
 
02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:06.870 align:start position:0%
bill is written
now

02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
um I think it's still
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
it it still means
 
02:06:20.549 --> 02:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
that a parent who may have been abusive
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
to a child or over a significant period
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
of time as long as 2
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
months uh May Escape prosecution because
 
02:06:32.549 --> 02:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
it says here as a direct result of
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
apparent acting in accordance with this
 
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
chapter and to me and this is just me
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm not giving a legal opinion I'm
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
giving a plain English opinion um as a
 
02:06:46.270 --> 02:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
direct result means you wouldn't have
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
known about this except that somebody
 
02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
surrendered that child and I think all
 
02:06:55.549 --> 02:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
of us are very much in favor of allowing
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
parents to surrender a child if they are
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
convinced that they are un unable to uh
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
raise the child we want the child to
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
have the best opportunity at life but I
 
02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
also don't think that uh this
 
02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:14.549 align:start position:0%
also don't think that uh this
language

02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
allows the deterrent effect that I think
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
we need if in fact I'm I I just see the
 
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
one horrendous case coming down the road
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
and nobody knew about this child nobody
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
reported this child so it isn't like I
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
think in this case if if say the
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
neighbors had already called DCF and
 
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
said really concerned about the kid down
 
02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:38.709 align:start position:0%
said really concerned about the kid down
the

02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:41.229 --> 02:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
street and then the child was
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
surrendered you still have the neighbors
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
and and them talking about their
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
concerns cuz that's not a direct result
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
of the surrender but if nobody had ever
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
said anything about this particular
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
child and their fears for this child and
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
the child
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
arrived very heavily abused clearly
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
abused uh clearly voluntarily abused or
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
or severely neglected either one I think
 
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
that this means that that's the end of
 
02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
the story and I'm I'm not comfortable
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
with that and and it's one of the
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
reasons why I'm not comfortable with
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
going from five days to the 60 days so
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
but that's not what we're talking about
 
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
in the amendment so other people may
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
have other interpretations because it
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how much we polish the
 
02:08:36.669 --> 02:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
pearls people see them differently um
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's mine that's my concern
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt and then
 
02:08:41.199 --> 02:08:42.790 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt and then
representative

02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
Lon uh thank you Mr chairman so I I
 
02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:47.109 align:start position:0%
Lon uh thank you Mr chairman so I I
think

02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
um my my reading of it my interpretation
 
02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
of the language
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
actually does fall on the other side of
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
the the center line I I guess um the way
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
I read this it it says
 
02:09:04.549 --> 02:09:04.559 align:start position:0%
that any evidence obtained as a direct
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
result of a parent dropping off their
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
child shall not be
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
grounds and to me that that suggests
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
that there may still be an investigation
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
and other grounds may be determined
 
02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:22.709 align:start position:0%
and other grounds may be determined
sufficient

02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
I believe that in the vast majority of
 
02:09:31.149 --> 02:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
cases where a child is dropped off and
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
it seems very very clear that there has
 
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.069 align:start position:0%
it seems very very clear that there has
been

02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
abuse it is it is likely that an
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
investigation would ensue if
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
possible that leaves me concerned that
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
sufficiently removing the disincentive
 
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
to drop off the child um having said
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
that I do know that a lot of work went
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
into this and I know that that legal
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
council was was closely involved in the
 
02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
process of of drafting this language so
 
02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
um I will be voting for the amendment um
 
02:10:08.669 --> 02:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
but I I guess I just wanted to offer
 
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
that alternate interpretation
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I think this really is
 
02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
about all of those hard cases you have
 
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
an infant and the parent strikes them
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
and they're in the car and what do they
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
do they go to the hospital maybe that
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
parent's not going to do that do they do
 
02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:33.639 align:start position:0%
they kill the child or do they go to a
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
safe drop off and say I and say I lost
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
my cool I can't do this I'm giving this
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
baby up because I just did this and I
 
02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
can't trust
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
myself it's a horrible thing to have to
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
think about but our question is do we
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
want to make it so that child has a
 
02:10:52.750 --> 02:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
chance to live because the parents able
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
to drop them off um at this point I I
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
fall on the side of giving that
 
02:11:00.910 --> 02:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
protection because I am more important
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
in that CH more concerned about that
 
02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
child and that child's life than I am
 
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
about that prosecution because that's
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
what it comes down to um and I want to
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
save that life it's there's so many of
 
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
these other externalities that I wish we
 
02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
could control for but if we could
 
02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
legislate about that or if we could fix
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't have to worry about
 
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
these situations you know it's it's
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
really a hard Challenge and I understand
 
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
why people fall on both sides of this
 
02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
but I think it's more important that a
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
parent can say what have I done and
 
02:11:33.310 --> 02:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
relinquish the child and save that
 
02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.830 align:start position:0%
relinquish the child and save that
child's

02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.830 --> 02:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
life other
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
discussion saying no other discussion
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the all a
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%

representative coo uh yes I move otpa on
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
U house bill 16007 with Amendment uh
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
2024 1228 is there a second second
 
02:13:09.069 --> 02:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
representative Leon seconds would you
 
02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your
 
02:13:15.229 --> 02:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
motion um yeah I I I think I'll keep it
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
brief because I think we've we've said
 
02:13:19.870 --> 02:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
it all before this bill is intended to
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh to save lives
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
um I think there are a number of thorny
 
02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
issues that that emerge um I don't think
 
02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
that we can solve all of them but I
 
02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
think we can take our existing uh our
 
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
existing law and move the ball forward
 
02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
and potentially save more lives in the
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
process so I urge my colleagues to vote
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
Weber and while I have exactly the same
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
objective which is saving more lives I
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
truly believe we got it right when we
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
passed the safe haven law that we passed
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
um I I feel that having the short period
 
02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
of time and a warm
 
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
handoff is just something I in my gut
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable with and I
 
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
cannot give
 
02:14:18.910 --> 02:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
it an intellectual
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
explanation um but
 
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I feel comfortable with and
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
and this bill as it is been brought to
 
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
us I don't feel comfortable with I'm
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about the longer period of
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
time I'm concerned about the fact that I
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe that
 
02:14:40.589 --> 02:14:40.599 align:start position:0%
anybody who
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
is truly disorganized and unable to
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
control their behavior and is truly
 
02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.709 align:start position:0%
control their behavior and is truly
desperate

02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
desperate
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
is going to be organized enough to find
 
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
the place get to the
 
02:15:00.830 --> 02:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
place uh and and do all of that and
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
I I just think we got it right the first
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
time and so that's why I will be voting
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
no but I do recognize and applaud the
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
work the
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
concern and the effort that goes into
 
02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
concern and the effort that goes into
this

02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
because we all want babies to be raised
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
in safe caring loving environments so
 
02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I recognize the concern
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
around shortening the time period but we
 
02:15:38.109 --> 02:15:38.119 align:start position:0%
also need to think about some of the
 
02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
babies that are born they're a little
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
medically complex and it takes over a
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
week for the mom and baby to be
 
02:15:45.549 --> 02:15:45.559 align:start position:0%
discharged from the hospital with that
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
if they get home in two or three days
 
02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
into it they just realize that the the
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
supports they thought that were going to
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
have aren't there and they hit that
 
02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
crisis point you know why are we going
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
to say that somebody that some people
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
get to have a few days at home before
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
they have this opportunity versus other
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
people who have a longer stay don't have
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
it you know it's one of those areas it's
 
02:16:09.390 --> 02:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
challenging because I do agree that two
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
months does open up a larger window but
 
02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
honestly that first week doesn't seem to
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
be with the other the new moms that I've
 
02:16:19.629 --> 02:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
spoken with that's not really the where
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
the dip hits when you're going through
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
that because you're still on the
 
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
adrenaline you still have people showing
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
up to help if you have a support network
 
02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
but if your support network is fleeting
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
and they're gone two weeks into it
 
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
that's where you may actually be hitting
 
02:16:36.270 --> 02:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
more of your crisis mode and that's
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
where it actually becomes a little bit
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
more important for some to have some of
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
this access um and and I know that
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's some concern around the boxes
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
themselves too but just because there's
 
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
you know I worked in medical devices
 
02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
these aren't medical devices so it's not
 
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
limited to just any certain approved
 
02:16:54.429 --> 02:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
design obviously that's one where
 
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
anybody who's doing one of these baby
 
02:16:57.990 --> 02:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
boxes would make sure that what they're
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
doing meets the intent and the
 
02:17:01.709 --> 02:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
requirements of it but you know it's not
 
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
like we're creating any sort of Monopoly
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
I mean catch me later at one o'clock I'm
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
fighting the monopolies I'm fighting uh
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
fighting against that whole sort of
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
model so um hopefully you understand
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
that that I see this an opportunity not
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
just to have one type of baby box but to
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
have this as um as an opportunity
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
because some people are just so
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
incredibly ashamed to say that they
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
can't take care of their kids and to
 
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
face another human they'd rather not
 
02:17:31.709 --> 02:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
exist than face another human and say
 
02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
that they failed their child and do we
 
02:17:36.270 --> 02:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
really want that parent and that kid in
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
a situation where they'd rather not
 
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
exist than have to admit that they
 
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
failed and I think this baby Box gives
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
gives a way to save those lives and
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
allow them to to make a better safer
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
choice and move past it representative
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
Canon and then representative kofalt
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
Merchant um I haven't spoken up a lot
 
02:17:59.230 --> 02:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
about about this particular bill but I
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
am a co-sponsor um and I value the life
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
of a child and um my intent when I was
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
asked to co-sponsor This was um will it
 
02:18:11.469 --> 02:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
save the life of one more
 
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
child um uh I recognize that there's
 
02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
some potential problems with um
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
with the bill as it
 
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
stands um but that's a fairly complex
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
topic is do we do we cover all of the
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
aspects of it um my gut feel is um that
 
02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
it would be much better to pass this and
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
get something put into place and if
 
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
there's a problem that maybe we need
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
that state needs to revisit and iron out
 
02:18:48.030 --> 02:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
what the problems are with this but if
 
02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
it saves the life of a child I I think
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do and and I
 
02:18:55.389 --> 02:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
would vote for it thank you
 
02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Kofa thank you Mr
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
chairman so just um as a point of
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
reference um looking at other states in
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
New England and the time frame that they
 
02:19:09.389 --> 02:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
allow Connecticut is uh 30 days Maine is
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
31 days Massachusetts is s New Hampshire
 
02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
is seven Rhode Island is 30 days Vermont
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
is 30 days so um that's just a point of
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
reference that I think a number number
 
02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
of others have have deemed that to be a
 
02:19:25.709 --> 02:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
very reasonable time frame I think U
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
many of them for the reasons that uh
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative Leon outlined um and you
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
know it may be that the other body wants
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
to uh to to cut this back to 30 days but
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
30 days certainly I think is is
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely reasonable and um does have
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
the potential to save more lives
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and then
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative fedus thank you Mr chair
 
02:19:54.990 --> 02:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
I wanted to uh say thank you to
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli who's in the
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
audience um for working and trying to
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
find a way to thread the
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
needle sometimes uh is a little more
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
challenging than others this is one of
 
02:20:06.349 --> 02:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
those challenging
 
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
times I went back and did some research
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that came out of
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
the Yale School of Law in
 
02:20:18.349 --> 02:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
medicine is the issue of restricting it
 
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
to a parent particularly to a mother um
 
02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
to a parent particularly to a mother um
was

02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:20:24.030 --> 02:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
problematic and what it really comes
 
02:20:26.429 --> 02:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
down to is that sometimes you have
 
02:20:29.469 --> 02:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
mothers who live in areas that a rle
 
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have transportation they
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the way to get to a baby box
 
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
number two you have mothers who probably
 
02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:35.870 align:start position:0%
number two you have mothers who probably
don't

02:20:35.870 --> 02:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
have the WHERE forall if you will um to
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the law and therefore
 
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
you have to rely upon somebody else to
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
bring the child to a baby box or to a
 
02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
safe haven this law does not allow for
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
that it only allows for the parent and I
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
I do understand the other side of the
 
02:20:54.429 --> 02:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
issue that you could have somebody as a
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
grandparent that could kidnap the child
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you will um but I think we need to be
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
sure that if we're really talking about
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
the child and protecting the child that
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
we have multiple ways to get the child
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
to a baby box not limit it only to the
 
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
mother or to the
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
parent the other issue I have is what I
 
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
call Gross physical abuse um or gross
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
neglect which is different than abuse or
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
neglect um again those terms are back to
 
02:21:20.319 --> 02:21:21.469 align:start position:0%
neglect um again those terms are back to
the

02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
legal ease uh I think defined when you
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
talk about gross abuse if you have a
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
child who's been grossly abused and when
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
you go from 5 days to 60 days that's a
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
long time to abuse a child and sometimes
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
you get to the point where you're at the
 
02:21:40.110 --> 02:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
end of the rope and you really have a
 
02:21:42.990 --> 02:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
child that has been abused to a point
 
02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
where it's
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
almost non-reversible um you could have
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
a child with a shaking the child and
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's been shown again with person who
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
takes a child and shakes them because
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
they just are so frustrated with the
 
02:21:59.230 --> 02:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
child is the trauma in the brain is
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
phenomenal so what I'm trying to be sure
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
of is that if that is
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
occurring at that point in time whoever
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
is doing that we're not protecting it
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
now the way this is done with the parent
 
02:22:12.990 --> 02:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
If the parents doing it they get get out
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
of jail free card if it's somebody else
 
02:22:16.510 --> 02:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
not the parent which is a good thing
 
02:22:18.670 --> 02:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
about limiting it to the parent then
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
they don't so I'm trying to look at this
 
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
and saying how do we protect the child
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
not just to have the child come to a
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
safe haven but the journey from birth
 
02:22:31.389 --> 02:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
the safe haven that they don't come to
 
02:22:33.790 --> 02:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
the safe haven in such a way that they
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
really are still alive but they're not
 
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
going to be able to really live and
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's the what I struggle with that's
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
the Quant I'm in um so therefore I think
 
02:22:43.389 --> 02:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
the 60 days is problematic because of
 
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
that uh third days would be better the
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
short of the window I think is better um
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
but right now we don't have uh language
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
and they are talking about gross abuse
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
or gross neglect so therefore I would
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
not be able to support the bill
 
02:22:58.750 --> 02:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative frus and then
 
02:23:01.469 --> 02:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
chair um my thought is about the warm
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
handoff the fact that you're putting
 
02:23:10.389 --> 02:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
this baby in a box like mailing a letter
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
what about the mother is there any
 
02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
intervention for the mother any
 
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
intervention for the future of the child
 
02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
so I would voting itl that we would drop
 
02:23:22.349 --> 02:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
the baby in the box thank you
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King and then
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative Shapero thank you Mr
 
02:23:27.309 --> 02:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
chair I've already spoken a lot about
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
this bill the first day we um looked at
 
02:23:34.030 --> 02:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
it um so I will try not to repeat myself
 
02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:35.230 align:start position:0%
it um so I will try not to repeat myself
but

02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:23:38.670 --> 02:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
um I did I spoke with a representative
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
from Cornerstone after that day and um I
 
02:23:44.269 --> 02:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
came to the conclusion that you know my
 
02:23:45.870 --> 02:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
original Amendment which was going to
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
scrap the exclusionary clause Al
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
together that was also faulty because um
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
and I understand now that you know if if
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're Prosecuting people for what I
 
02:24:01.469 --> 02:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
would consider victimless crimes um as a
 
02:24:03.309 --> 02:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
result of this then what's going to end
 
02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
up happening is that there will be too
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
many people that would be afraid to use
 
02:24:08.590 --> 02:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
the baby boxes it would get a bad WP and
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
then they wouldn't get used and I
 
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
understand that completely um so my my
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
original amendment of just getting rid
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
of it was too far um however my original
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
concerns which was just articulated by
 
02:24:23.269 --> 02:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant remain which is
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of not just you know a poor
 
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
parent but somebody who really
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
intentionally abuses children um and the
 
02:24:35.230 --> 02:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
idea of protecting that is not something
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
I can support under any circumstances
 
02:24:41.269 --> 02:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
still I was hopeful that um this
 
02:24:43.389 --> 02:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
amendment which I did vote for because I
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
I do think that um the bill should be
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
presented as intended by the author and
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
such um but the the amendment
 
02:24:54.429 --> 02:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
uh it does not thread the needle um and
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't um you know
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
ideally what it would do is it would let
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
people so to speak off the hook for you
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
know drug crimes um but people who
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
really intentionally abuse children um
 
02:25:11.150 --> 02:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
they would not be off the hook and and
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
so I went home as I was driving home the
 
02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
other day thinking about it I couldn't
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
quite wrap my head around why um why it
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
just felt so wrong to me the idea of
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
letting somebody off the hook um and you
 
02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
know that we often hear it's better to
 
02:25:28.429 --> 02:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
have a an alive baby than than a dead
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
baby and I can understand that
 
02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
completely however um that's not
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
actually how we we act in society so for
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
example if somebody were to kidnap a
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
child and they had that child for a
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
couple of months would we would the law
 
02:25:47.469 --> 02:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement come out and give a Clarion
 
02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
call to the entire State and say look if
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
you just bring back the baby there will
 
02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
be no prosecution whatsoever would we do
 
02:25:56.269 --> 02:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
that no we would not do that and you
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
might be able to say well maybe we
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
should just let the kidnapper off the
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
hook because um it's better to have an
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
alive baby than a dead baby never mind
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that who knows what they've
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
done to that baby in the last couple
 
02:26:10.269 --> 02:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
months so we don't we don't do that nor
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
should we and it also was kind of along
 
02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
the lines of like um you know hostages
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
we don't negotiate with terrorists
 
02:26:20.670 --> 02:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
because the moment you do that yes you
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
might save the life of that one hostage
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
but then you're going to send that
 
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
Clarion call out to every other
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
opportunist who will now say hey look I
 
02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
all have to do is kidnap somebody
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
they'll give me the million dollars and
 
02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
let me go scotf free therefore let's
 
02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
start doing that and my concern is is
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
that when we
 
02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
let people who abuse children off the
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
hook we are opening up Pandora's Box to
 
02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
let all of the wouldbe opportunists take
 
02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of this there was an article
 
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
in in the news just the other day some
 
02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
lady was pimping out her newborn child
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
to sexual predators so this is something
 
02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
that really does happen and my fear is
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
that if we put something like this in
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
the law we're basically saying you can
 
02:27:03.510 --> 02:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
do whatever you want to a child for 61
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
days as long as you bring it back no
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
questions asked and I can't go with that
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
I think we need to send a strong signal
 
02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
that if you abuse children we will come
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
after you we will prosecute you under
 
02:27:14.510 --> 02:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
the fullest extent of the law zero
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
tolerance for people who abuse children
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
period so that's why I can't support
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
this thank you thank you representative
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
car thank you Mr chairman so I've gone
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
from agreeing with representative King's
 
02:27:30.030 --> 02:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
um feelings about accountability when he
 
02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
first brought it up so eloquently to um
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
today agreeing with representative kof's
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
um statement about the immunity not
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
going far enough um and so I've I
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
realize how difficult an issue that is
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
and I've been all over the map but my
 
02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
real my concerns at this point with the
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill or other than that which are
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm uncomfortable with this um being
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
written for Safe Haven baby boxes which
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
are essentially um you know specific
 
02:28:08.830 --> 02:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
company and um I've talked to
 
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli about that and
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
he suggested that there are other
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
possibilities to look into which I think
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
is a good thing so I'm I'm I'm
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with it being written for
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
a particular company I'm really
 
02:28:23.269 --> 02:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the whole idea of
 
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
putting children in a box I think the
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the significance of anonymity is
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
probably a little overblown here and
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
that um you know things go wrong I mean
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
we have scientists and computer
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
scientists who will develop these boxes
 
02:28:42.990 --> 02:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
in a way to um make them as safe as
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
possible but nobody expected Co um you
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
know nobody expected some of the um
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know dramatic um things that have
 
02:28:57.269 --> 02:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
happened like nuclear meltdowns we just
 
02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't have control over te we technology
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us the control that we
 
02:29:04.349 --> 02:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
think it has so I am much more
 
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable with someone handing off a
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
child to Al live person um I am I I do
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
think that extending the time to 30 days
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
or even 60 days is a good idea I think
 
02:29:19.269 --> 02:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
we should keep in mind that this isn't
 
02:29:22.950 --> 02:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
the only way that people can come to
 
02:29:24.670 --> 02:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
terms with not being able to take care
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
of their child and getting help
 
02:29:29.389 --> 02:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
including putting their you know
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
terminating their own parental rights
 
02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:33.150 align:start position:0%
terminating their own parental rights
and

02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
um creating the opportunity for other
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
parents to take care of this baby um
 
02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
this law is not the only way that that
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
happens that happens with people coming
 
02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
to DCF or coming to the attention of DCF
 
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
getting involved with DCF and saying
 
02:29:51.870 --> 02:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
saying that they you know they're really
 
02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
not capable of taking care of a child
 
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
and child goes into forcer home and is
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
eventually adopted so we shouldn't think
 
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
that this is the only mechanism for
 
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.590 align:start position:0%
that this is the only mechanism for
someone

02:30:04.590 --> 02:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
someone
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
um for someone coming to their senses
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
that they are not able to be the parent
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
for a child there are other options as
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
well so for for all those reasons plus
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that when we were trying to
 
02:30:21.269 --> 02:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
when we were trying to interpret what we
 
02:30:24.429 --> 02:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
wrote as the in the new
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment we all agreed that we weren't
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
sure what it meant um so I don't I'm not
 
02:30:32.349 --> 02:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
really comfortable with passing a I'm
 
02:30:34.510 --> 02:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
not I think this is well intended I
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
don't think it's ready for us to pass so
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against it
 
02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you I wanted to
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
note that this is not set for any
 
02:30:48.910 --> 02:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
particular company's uh
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
boxes if I may Mr chair representative
 
02:30:53.550 --> 02:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
Merchant I just checked on that because
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
I was concerned about that too but that
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
is a patented
 
02:31:00.990 --> 02:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
name it's a patented name yes
 
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
ma'am representative McKay and then
 
02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative kushman thank you Mr
 
02:31:10.349 --> 02:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
chairman 20 years ago is the first time
 
02:31:14.110 --> 02:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
I remember this legislation coming
 
02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
before us uh so it's pretty remarkable
 
02:31:20.590 --> 02:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
that 20 years later it's still here
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
which which to me means there is a
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
tremendous need uh for this kind of
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and and it's difficult to
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
get that uh somebody talked about the
 
02:31:36.590 --> 02:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
symbolism of a box and it certainly
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
reminded me of a
 
02:31:41.410 --> 02:31:41.420 align:start position:0%
coffen and uh we can't
 
02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:42.870 align:start position:0%
coffen and uh we can't
[Music]

02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
be driven Off The Track by being
 
02:31:49.990 --> 02:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about those kinds of things uh
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
I think there's a great need uh uh to uh
 
02:31:58.349 --> 02:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
in addition to what is available to
 
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
protect these children this is the
 
02:32:05.309 --> 02:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
first opportunity I think we've had
 
02:32:08.269 --> 02:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
since 20 years ago to do that and
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm going to vote
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative kushman
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um well my
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion I'm not sure if having the
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
name even though it is a patented name
 
02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
we're not using
 
02:32:29.269 --> 02:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
it to sell a different product or
 
02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
something like that it's it's it's also
 
02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
a descriptive
 
02:32:36.510 --> 02:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
name um and not necessarily used in that
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
manner but I don't know how th that
 
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
those kind of laws work um with us
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
having this in Statue but my suggestion
 
02:32:46.630 --> 02:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
is that we if this gets through this
 
02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
committee and then through the house
 
02:32:52.590 --> 02:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
that we ask this the other body to maybe
 
02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
change that name once it gets there Mr
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
chair representative I respond to
 
02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
Fishman I I concur what you're saying um
 
02:33:03.469 --> 02:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
but the certain words that we use like
 
02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
Kleenex Pica um that are patented names
 
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore if we refer to it that way
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're in essence which is my concern
 
02:33:14.590 --> 02:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
here as a state we're endorsing a
 
02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
particular manufacturer of a product and
 
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
not allowing the free market to do what
 
02:33:19.150 --> 02:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to do if somebody else
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
wants to come back into the market and
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
compete against
 
02:33:25.510 --> 02:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
it rep representative kofalt and then
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel I don't
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
know okay all right thank you Mr
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so so my intent in supporting
 
02:33:36.990 --> 02:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
this and my understanding of this is
 
02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
that it is not endorsing the use of one
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
company's product in particular so to
 
02:33:47.550 --> 02:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
the extent that that is um you know
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
helpful to anybody who may want to
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
interpret this in the future that is my
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
intention U my understanding is that
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's currently one company that um
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
that makes these boxes but that there
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
are private con charitable concerns that
 
02:34:07.469 --> 02:34:07.479 align:start position:0%
have come up with um designs and are
 
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
building these boxes in some other
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
states so I think that there are I
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
believe three designs out there one of
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
which is the is the safe haven box um
 
02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
referred to here representative Nel and
 
02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
then representative Lon I guess since I
 
02:34:24.030 --> 02:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
researched it I wanted to bring it up
 
02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
but I I I really didn't understand the
 
02:34:29.790 --> 02:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
60-day thing where that number came from
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
if there was any scientific evidence I
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
have a graph with all 650 States and
 
02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
what their rules are 60 would definitely
 
02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:37.640 align:start position:0%
be an
 
02:34:41.790 --> 02:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
outlier uh the mode is 30 um most of the
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
states are in the 29 to 28 to 31 day
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
range um one's 360 four days so if you
 
02:34:53.469 --> 02:34:53.479 align:start position:0%
pick 60 that that's an extreme obviously
 
02:34:53.479 --> 02:34:54.750 align:start position:0%
pick 60 that that's an extreme obviously
North

02:34:54.750 --> 02:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
North
 
02:34:57.710 --> 02:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
Dakota um but there's only a handful
 
02:35:03.550 --> 02:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
that are are over 30 so so I I I I mean
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
again I don't you guys know process
 
02:35:07.309 --> 02:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
better than me the Senate can certainly
 
02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
change that I just don't know how you
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
feel about that or the other body sorry
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative Leon then representative
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
Weber uh thank you Mr chairman I think
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
through all of our discussion in
 
02:35:17.469 --> 02:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
committee it's been very clear that we
 
02:35:20.349 --> 02:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
aren't looking to endorse any specific
 
02:35:22.510 --> 02:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer um I think that that's
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
something that easily we can ask to
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
change and I think the other body knows
 
02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
how I feel about the government handing
 
02:35:31.710 --> 02:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
out relationships with for-profit
 
02:35:34.349 --> 02:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
companies so I definitely promise that
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
I'll be going over I'm assuming this
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
makes it through and and and making that
 
02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
clear that we never had any intent for
 
02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
that to be that the specific company and
 
02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
that perhaps a different name may make
 
02:35:47.550 --> 02:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
sense um but I don't think that that's a
 
02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:48.630 align:start position:0%
sense um but I don't think that that's a
reason

02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
to I'm not even going to make the pun I
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a reason to not do
 
02:35:56.349 --> 02:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
this um I think that that really you
 
02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
know this isn't a partisan thing we have
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
people that we have people on both sides
 
02:36:03.630 --> 02:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
that are very heartfelt about
 
02:36:05.309 --> 02:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
specifically what they think is best
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
here but I think that I think that we
 
02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
should see and try and get this through
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
because I think that this can save kids
 
02:36:14.349 --> 02:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
and this will still have further
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
deliberation even after it leaves us and
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
even after even if it makes it through
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
the floor representative Weber and then
 
02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:22.190 align:start position:0%
the floor representative Weber and then
representative

02:36:22.190 --> 02:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:36:25.710 --> 02:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chairman and uh um I
 
02:36:27.550 --> 02:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
thank representative Leon for those
 
02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
words and I I can count so um I'm hoping
 
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
that whoever writes uh what I suspect is
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to be a majority report on this uh
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
will say specifically that the members
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee were pretty unanimous
 
02:36:44.990 --> 02:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
and that I mean my assumption is that
 
02:36:46.990 --> 02:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
we're pretty unanimous in not wanting
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
this to be specific and that will be a
 
02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:50.349 align:start position:0%
this to be specific and that will be a
fur

02:36:50.349 --> 02:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
fur
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh representation of the intent behind
 
02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:54.670 align:start position:0%
uh representation of the intent behind
the

02:36:54.670 --> 02:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:57.389 --> 02:36:57.399 align:start position:0%
bill I want to go
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
back to what we have in statute now and
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
although it has been a long time since
 
02:37:05.710 --> 02:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
Revisited I think we got it right the
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
first time around and what I am
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about is the
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
issue of the warm
 
02:37:19.309 --> 02:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
handoff and and the short handoff and I
 
02:37:21.790 --> 02:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
understand understand that
 
02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I understand the issue of the shame
 
02:37:27.150 --> 02:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
and the concern about somebody who just
 
02:37:30.389 --> 02:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
can't bear to actually have another
 
02:37:32.830 --> 02:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
person see them do this or acknowledge
 
02:37:38.309 --> 02:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
that they're doing this but I am very
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about a couple of things one
 
02:37:43.950 --> 02:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
is who knows who's dropped this baby off
 
02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
I mean some of us want more people to be
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
able to drop a baby off but I'm
 
02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
somebody perhaps good-hearted perhaps
 
02:37:55.469 --> 02:37:55.479 align:start position:0%
less good-hearted dropping a baby off
 
02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:02.349 --> 02:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh how does that work the other thing
 
02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about is if we have what
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
is called a warm handoff you have to
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
hand it the baby to a person there is
 
02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
also somebody there who can be concerned
 
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
for and care
 
02:38:21.790 --> 02:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
about the parent doing the handing off
 
02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
and perhaps you know one of one of the
 
02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
things that's my concern is again I I
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
think we're all concerned about the same
 
02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
things I think we come to different
 
02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
conclusions about how we deal with them
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
but the parent who is in despair because
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
they're new at this the supports they
 
02:38:40.590 --> 02:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
thought they had aren't there life is
 
02:38:43.269 --> 02:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
currently really awful they're worried
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
they can't do this
 
02:38:50.110 --> 02:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
um for some people
 
02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
the act of talking to a live person may
 
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
show them that there are things out
 
02:38:58.590 --> 02:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
there that will help them and that will
 
02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:00.630 align:start position:0%
there that will help them and that will
help

02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:39:03.990 --> 02:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
them maintain their relationship with
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
this child if that's what they want to
 
02:39:07.550 --> 02:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
do and I I I understand that there
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
reasons on all sides for wanting
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
different things I just I think that
 
02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
having the intervention of a live
 
02:39:19.950 --> 02:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
person is really key for me
 
02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:22.190 align:start position:0%
person is really key for me
and

02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
um that's why I don't like being
 
02:39:28.110 --> 02:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
disobliging but because I do recognize
 
02:39:30.429 --> 02:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
the concern that comes out of everybody
 
02:39:34.269 --> 02:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
on this but that's my sticking point
 
02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative
 
02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
mlan yeah thank you Mr chair I mean I've
 
02:39:40.910 --> 02:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
been back and forth like a pingpong ball
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
on this thing uh because so many good
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
points are being raised by both sides
 
02:39:47.950 --> 02:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
and but for me I think at the end of the
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
day I think where I'm finally landing on
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
this is ultimately there's just too many
 
02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
what ifs I a th% support the intention
 
02:39:59.950 --> 02:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill but I guess for me there's
 
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's so many what if and I really
 
02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the clarity in my mind in
 
02:40:07.630 --> 02:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
terms of how these would play out but I
 
02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
would almost at this point be leaning
 
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
towards expanding it out to the 30 days
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
because I think there's value in giving
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
that extra time you know but maintaining
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh the warm handoff but I guess at the
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
end of the day no matter where you come
 
02:40:23.349 --> 02:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
up there's just so many wh ifs that I
 
02:40:25.309 --> 02:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't think this is is is ready to go at
 
02:40:27.110 --> 02:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
this point so I think my conscience is
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
not going to allow me to to support at
 
02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
this time okay we've pretty well covered
 
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
it uh I'd like to move to a vote unless
 
02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
somebody has anything radically
 
02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
new last The Collector call a roll
 
02:40:42.670 --> 02:40:42.680 align:start position:0%

Angst and and some of the points about
 
02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
um extending the time and some I I think
 
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
there are things that we are all really
 
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
quite in agreement about uh I would move
 
02:42:26.910 --> 02:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
interim study so that we could really
 
02:42:29.550 --> 02:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
work on this some more and figure out
 
02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
exactly which components we're agreeing
 
02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
to and which components uh we continue
 
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
to have doubts about so I think it's
 
02:42:41.150 --> 02:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
worth pursuing I know that the goals are
 
02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
are truly important so those are my
 
02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
reasons for intern study I'll second
 
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:48.880 align:start position:0%

um okay and finally uh last bill to
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
consider this morning is HP 1067
 
02:44:32.309 --> 02:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative L do you have a motion um
 
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I move inter room study
 
02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
is there a second second representative
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
Merchant seconds do you wish to speak to
 
02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
a motion um yes please um so this bill
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
seeks to address the problem of women
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
denied hysterectomies primarily because
 
02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
the physician believes that she'll want
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
to have more more children even if she
 
02:44:52.510 --> 02:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
emphatically says otherwise by not
 
02:44:54.190 --> 02:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
allowing this as a reason to Desy a
 
02:44:56.349 --> 02:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
procedure it also requires that a
 
02:44:57.950 --> 02:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
provider refer somebody seeking
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary St sterilization to a willing
 
02:45:03.269 --> 02:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
enabl provider and lastly there's
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
protection for patients who changed
 
02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
their mind even though it was
 
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
appropriately documented that they
 
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
wanted the sterilization so while this
 
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
is a very real and important issue of
 
02:45:14.269 --> 02:45:14.279 align:start position:0%
inappropriately denied care you know
 
02:45:16.910 --> 02:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
this is a really big problem to overcome
 
02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
most importantly because it's in the
 
02:45:20.990 --> 02:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights the patients Bill
 
02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
of Rights does not have bearing on the
 
02:45:26.590 --> 02:45:26.600 align:start position:0%
individual action of Physicians if we
 
02:45:29.469 --> 02:45:29.479 align:start position:0%
were to say um I had actually drafted
 
02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
some language for an amendment to say
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
that the reason if the the patient was
 
02:45:36.990 --> 02:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
not otherwise contraindicated for the
 
02:45:39.630 --> 02:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
procedure and if it was simply because
 
02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the number of children or their
 
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
providers saying thinking that the
 
02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
person woman woman wouldn't want more
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
children even though she says not that
 
02:45:48.510 --> 02:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
if she is otherwise appropriately
 
02:45:50.429 --> 02:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
indicated there's not BMI issues there's
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
not bleeding issues there's nothing else
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
and that is solely the reason that that
 
02:45:56.790 --> 02:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
can't be a reason because quite frankly
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's discrimination about the number
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
of children that you think that somebody
 
02:46:02.910 --> 02:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
should have um I I had some language
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
that I thought actually was quite good I
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
sent it into OS and then I realized
 
02:46:09.910 --> 02:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're in the wrong section of law we are
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the patients Bill of Rights and it's
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
binding on facilities and it was too
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
late to do anything we can't have
 
02:46:17.110 --> 02:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
another hearing because it wouldn't be
 
02:46:19.309 --> 02:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
Germaine I had another bill where it was
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
drafted in the wrong section I lost my
 
02:46:23.469 --> 02:46:23.479 align:start position:0%
bill to interim study because actually
 
02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
my bill was killed it was ited because
 
02:46:29.070 --> 02:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
of that but we can't change it now um I
 
02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
I apologized to the sponsors for not
 
02:46:32.590 --> 02:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
noticing that it was on in the wrong
 
02:46:34.750 --> 02:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
section before every time I looked at it
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
I looked at the words I didn't look at
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
where it was placed and I'm going to own
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
that error but that's why I think we
 
02:46:42.190 --> 02:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
should in room study and try and figure
 
02:46:44.190 --> 02:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
out how we can prevent that
 
02:46:46.030 --> 02:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination because somebody thinks
 
02:46:48.269 --> 02:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
you should have more kids and separate
 
02:46:50.110 --> 02:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
that out from what doctors do and
 
02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
deciding if you are actually a good
 
02:46:54.990 --> 02:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
candidate for a procedure for medical
 
02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
reasons so I you know I feel badly to
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
move in room study but I think that's
 
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
our only choice here other discussion
 
02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:05.429 align:start position:0%
our only choice here other discussion
representative

02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.790 --> 02:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes um I found the I found the
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
testimony brought by the um Prime
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the other people who came to
 
02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
be incredibly compelling and um
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
heartbreak to tell you the truth and
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
um so I feel bad about not doing
 
02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
anything but as well as it maybe being
 
02:47:30.429 --> 02:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
in the wrong area of
 
02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
law it's a really um seems like a really
 
02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:35.630 align:start position:0%
law it's a really um seems like a really
thorny

02:47:35.630 --> 02:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
thorny
 
02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
um question to try to resolve like
 
02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
how how you demand that uh a surgeon do
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
surgery that they don't feel comfortable
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
doing um if it's um do you want a
 
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
surgeon to do surgery that they're not
 
02:47:57.389 --> 02:47:57.399 align:start position:0%
that that they don't want to do um so my
 
02:48:00.550 --> 02:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
question isn't whether it's it's really
 
02:48:03.550 --> 02:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
a problem my question is I don't really
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand the best way to solve it um
 
02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's definitely discriminatory in my
 
02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
mind um but I'm not really sure that the
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill had a workable solution um so I
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
hope that we can work it and figure
 
02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
something out in the future
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
02:48:25.389 --> 02:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
chair um so I originally had an
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that was going to remove the
 
02:48:29.870 --> 02:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
first two sections because I think quite
 
02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
frankly there was very little support
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
for those first two sections in this
 
02:48:36.670 --> 02:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
committee um but there did seem to be
 
02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
some support for the third section which
 
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
was just basically going to provide
 
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
immunity for the doctors that somebody
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't later have regrets that they're
 
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to be sterilized um I didn't
 
02:48:48.910 --> 02:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
reintroduce it today because I was
 
02:48:52.230 --> 02:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
convinced by both um uh the vice chair
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the ranking member that it didn't
 
02:48:55.870 --> 02:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
belong in the in the part that it was
 
02:48:58.230 --> 02:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
trying to stick it into so I'm I'm going
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
to support interim study My Hope Is and
 
02:49:03.070 --> 02:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
I suspect that um the first two parts of
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
the bill are not going to be supported
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that um maybe they can just kind of
 
02:49:11.230 --> 02:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
figure out how to protect doctors from
 
02:49:13.590 --> 02:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know frivolous lawsuits and and
 
02:49:16.030 --> 02:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
allow them the freedom to perform
 
02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
sterilization without the fear that
 
02:49:19.469 --> 02:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have regrets later
 
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
on that's that's my hope I think it'll
 
02:49:25.110 --> 02:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
happen so that's why representative
 
02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
palazov um I will be voting against the
 
02:49:33.910 --> 02:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
interim study um and I I agree that uh
 
02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced is probably too
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
broad and um maybe it has some other
 
02:49:44.309 --> 02:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
issues but uh as was said it's a real
 
02:49:49.229 --> 02:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
and important issue and as I was told I
 
02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
I was telling during the hearing I
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
believe that culture has changed and our
 
02:49:56.590 --> 02:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
culture does not value fertility as much
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
as it was in the past and medical
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
education also does not value fertility
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
as much as so uh even though we have
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
some medical professionals who
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
might uh deny treatment uh uh I think uh
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
it will quickly go away uh the way uh
 
02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
culture and education changed uh so I
 
02:50:22.830 --> 02:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
think it's important to pass something
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
like that now because it's real an
 
02:50:30.190 --> 02:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
important issue thank you other
 
02:50:32.429 --> 02:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
