committee rules and procedures I think
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
everybody's got it a onepage y
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
thing look for a motion to adopt those
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
rules for the bium
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
second move second Motion in a second
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
all in favor say
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
hi and and oppos no that is adopted we
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
also had an a motion from representative
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
F which I will recognize him to describe
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
chair so you hopefully all have it's one
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
page in front of you um and I think you
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
all understand what it's for basically
 
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
it will allow the um audits that come
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
before us to be automatically released
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so that not only we can
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
see them but our constituents can see
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
them and we can um get input from them
 
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
if they if they want to um give it to us
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
so we can then question POS POS those
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions to people that come before us
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that's basically it it'll it'll add
 
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
that to the rules and then it'll be a
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
permanent part of the
 
00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.950 align:start position:0%
permanent part of the
rules

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards uh thank
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh and thank you for taking
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
my question representative I I I just am
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
trying I agree with the concept I just
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm I'm reading the
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
semantics and the timing of this it it
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
says all audits will be accepted
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
skipping ahead upon inclusion on the
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee agenda I I the the
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
trigger to accepting an audit I thought
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
was an action by the fiscal committee
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
not merely placing it on AG an agenda is
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
is that terminology the way you want it
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're changing rather
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
than having to wait for the fiscal
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee committee to see it and
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
approve it this is basically saying as
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
soon as it goes on to the fiscal
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
committee agenda it'll be put on to the
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
website release to the public release to
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
us and there'll be no further motions
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
necessary to release it after we have
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
even after we hear the report from the
 
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.230 align:start position:0%
even after we hear the report from the
Auditors

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
Auditors
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
followup do go ahead have we ever
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
rejected an audit uh do you know
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
representa walner and I couldn't
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
remember any in our many years of
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
experience I don't think anybody else is
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
okay then I'm I'm fine with the language
 
00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:58.110 align:start position:0%
okay then I'm I'm fine with the language
I

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
just it saves the clerk from having to
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
make that lengthy thing I I make the
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
motion that we accept the report place
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
it on file and release in the usual
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
minut Senator gray um this fits in with
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
another thing that I want to try to
 
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish and that is getting people to
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
use a tablet to get the bulk of this
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
material so that the clerks don't have
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
to go do that this is one of my first
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
days I've got the agenda up on my tablet
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
here and I'm going to try to use the
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
links that are in that uh just like
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
representative Earth does here uh we can
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
save some money if we can get everybody
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
to do it that way uh but I'm understand
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
that they probably won't get everybody
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
but even even even getting most of us
 
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
you know could be helpful a lot of heavy
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
lifting and having these audits on being
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
able to be put into the agenda and not
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
just paper copies in your book is a
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
furtherance towards that so I am in
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
favor of this will you second very
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
good did you second it yes very good
 
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:10.519 align:start position:0%
further discussion on amendment
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
five seeing none all in favor say I I
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%

item representative Edwards is

recognized for a question on
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
25004 okay uh thank you Mr chair and
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh this
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
this is uh related to um a great program
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh where we gather information from our
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
population and I am curious if uh the
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
the collection of personal data around
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
this program whether it's done on an
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
optin or an opt out
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
basis good morning good morning Ian watt
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'm the director for the division of
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services thank you for
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
your question representative Edwards so
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
the there is an RSA uh 13210 - A which
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
requires uh newborn screening for any
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
child born in New Hampshire that same
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
statute uh 13210 DC uh does allow for an
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
opt out for parents who may not want to
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
have their their children participate so
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's a a mandatory program with an
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
opt out uh should parents not want to
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
participate so so to say that a little
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
differently it it it's designed as an uh
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
an opt out program and the default
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
assumption is that everyone has opted in
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
until they opt out that's correct and
 
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason we do this screening just
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
by example uh we test for or baby's born
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire tested for a series of
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
potential hereditary disorders some of
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
these disorders by example may be
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
something like uh a children is not able
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
a child's not able to absorb fats so
 
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
it's really critical that you test that
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the first 24 to 48 hours you wouldn't
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
be able to see the effects of these
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
conditions none of them have any any
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
visible symptoms you would have what
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
looks like a very healthy baby with a
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
condition that may not be detectable and
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
may cause extreme Health outcomes or
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
even death if not treated and addressed
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh addressed quickly for example if if
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
you contined feeding breast milk or
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
regular formula formula to that child uh
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
they may have fairly dire Health
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes or or death one one more
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
followup follow well I I would like to
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
this is one of many programs it seems
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
that the department runs that are set up
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
on a default of requiring people to opt
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
out in order to avoid the data
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
collection and um and I and I understand
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
the desire um to do it that way but uh
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the coming next year and during my my
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
bill preparation I I'm going to look at
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
um U
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh optins for every data
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
collection and I'd like to be able to
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
talk to you about the various programs
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
that you have so that we can review them
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
and and do what makes sense happy to
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
discuss that thank you all right thank
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
you let attain a to adopt the
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
item question from Senator Rosen yes
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you could you tell us please what
 
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
the op out rate or the rate of babies
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
newborns getting the screening is yep
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then thank you for your question
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald in 2023 99.2% of all
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
newborns in New Hampshire were screened
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
by dried blood spot so we had a less
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
for being before us so my understanding
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
is that the only thing that's remaining
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
I guess in this being funded with this
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
the last part of this grant are the
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
community health workers and my question
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
is are any of these community health
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
workers Co collocated in school in our
 
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
workers Co collocated in school in our
Public

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
Schools thank you for your question no
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
will be working in schools they work
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
based out of largely Family Resource
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
Centers they work with our public health
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
networks and then a few other
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
you repres representative Edwards for a
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair this is
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
this is a kind of a related topic but
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
not directly applicable um on the
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh HR website there's a statement
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS also has many positions that are
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for telework and um with the uh
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
current national Focus on getting um
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
government employees back into the
 
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
offices I I'm just curious to the extent
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
to which uh
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh may need to go back through
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
those positions eligible for Tork and
 
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
and just validate or
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
revalidate that um teleworking is is the
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate um solution for for the good
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayer sure so the Department
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with that and and we've been
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
engaging in Tork for some time um we

indications at the at at the federal
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
level um but but ultimately at this
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
point in time we are following the state
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%

engineer for do thank you Senator Ros
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
just simply do you expect that this is
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
the only request you'll be making or
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
or are you planning on coming back this
 
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
or are you planning on coming back this
fiscal

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
year um that that depends entirely on on
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh the winter that's ahead of us that
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of there's uh several
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
storms predicted over the next 10 days
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
and and winter goes on for a while
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
longer um on average this would not be
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
an adequate transfer to get us through
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the year so would not be
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
would not be okay you could you could
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
expect that that uh a storm uh a small
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
storm would cost in excess of a million
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
dollars so if you look at that if if you
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
look at that um number it wouldn't take
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
many storms to hit the 5.7 million that
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
we're asking for here thank
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
you further from the committee several
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
of us were discussing the fact that we
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
were coming to work behind a plow that
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
was driving along with on a dry Road and
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
and rarely put down the blade so we're
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
wondering how prevalent that is and
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
whether there's a savings and when they
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
decide when to send out the plows and do
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
someone looked at the road before or is
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
that person driving the plow the one
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
that decides whether any plowing is
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
needed um thank you for the question um
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
there there's um a patrol Foreman in in
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
charge of the crew and there's a mean a
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
supervisor in charge of the foreman um
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
that generally put eyes on the road um
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
this morning it likely more likely was
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
um clean up clean up the the shoulder
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
and the snowbank along the edge of the
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
road more than anything they they may
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
have been called out at 4:00 a.m. for
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
conditions so
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
um U so that that's most likely what
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
you're seeing today was just clean up
 
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.080 align:start position:0%

November uh good morning my name is
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
Patricia Tilly I'm an associate
 
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner here at the Department of
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services thank you
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald when we submitted this
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
we had not yet finished the end of the
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
month of December when we had submitted
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
the dashboard okay and thank you and if
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
I could follow followup question second
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
question is on the next page the aid to
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
the um permanently and totally disabled
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
case loads continue to
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
decrease and I'm wondering is it because
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
we have fewer people who are permanently
 
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
and totally disabled under State's
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
definition or their over income or why
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
are we seeing those case loads
 
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
decrease I'm going to defer to Nathan if
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
he has an answer if not I'll follow up I
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
I I I think ultimately I need to go back
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
and talk to Alissa Hardy today to
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
understand the full Trend there is a
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
data error though um that you will see
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
in the aps clients line that says five
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
that should be 333 for the month of
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
November um but I can talk to Melissa
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hardy and Chris sanello see if there's
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
more larger systematic trends that
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
they're seeing and what are the causes
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
of that that would be great and my final
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
question is on the next page the
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Cent case loads
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
um this committee was told that by
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
September 1st of last year we would have
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
accurate case loow data so I my question
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
is is this case load data now accurate
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you no it is not yet accurate
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
there are two Community Mental Health
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
Centers who are going through EHR
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
conversions and when that is and that
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
has taken longer than planned and so
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
when that is complete we will go back
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
and fix the data going backwards you
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
know when that will do they have been
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
working on it full they they're working
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
on it Full Tilt thank you thank you Mr
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Senator rosemal any
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
further questions on the item
 
00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:11.909 align:start position:0%
further questions on the item
representative

00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you Mr chair I I noticed
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
the the positive trend with the uh cunu
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
Youth Development Center the census is
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
staying you know low um I I had um asked
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
a few months ago for um a presentation
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
or a briefing or a conversation or
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
however you want to call it on how uh
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
what the explicit mechanisms are for
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
being aware of the census and
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
anticipating um what kind of actions may
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
be necessary in terms of of um uh
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
transferring people to different
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
locations and the like I I'm still
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
looking forward to that conversation do
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware that we're developing that
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
that that presentation it's it's going
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
to be more relevant for the new center
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
than our existing Center but I'm sure
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
the methods are very very similar we are
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
currently working with courts and law
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement around how we're going to
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
address especially when we have
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
constraints in the new facility that we
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
will have a um we we will need to
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
maintain that low it's enrollment so we
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
are working on that we're working with
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
those Partners to give you those
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
explicit answers I'm going to talk at a
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
very high level about it this afternoon
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
I won't be going into too much detail
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
other than to acknowledge that the
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
census has been going in the right
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
direction and yet um we know we need to
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
be prepared for the um potential for
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
when we're in a new facility and we're
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
much more constrained how we will make
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
sure that we stay below the numbers that
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
are expected okay I well good I'm I'm
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
glad I'm glad you're working on it and
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
coordinating it with the community I
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
just when you're ready I'd really like
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
to know thank you
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
dashboard seeing none of there any other
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
items on information that anybody wishes
 
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.990 align:start position:0%
items on information that anybody wishes
discussion

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%

for representative

Lehman thank you Mr chairman I was just
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
had a couple of questions on item U 38
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
the Youth Development
 
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.629 align:start position:0%

Center
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
claims okay do we have anybody to
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
represent that
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
MH representative Lehman for a question
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:09.799 align:start position:0%
chairman so uh in the letter that we
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
received from the former Chief Justice
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
he points out that we need an efficient
 
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
Fair resolution to these potential
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
claims um
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday representative wer and I heard
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
from the uh judicial branch that this
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
has been a daunting task to get these
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
claims through and get them resolved in
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
a timely manner and there are hundreds
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
more still out there to be decided by
 
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:34.990 align:start position:0%
more still out there to be decided by
the

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
court um however the judicial branch has
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
been asked for a 4% cut um to try to
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
meet the budget deficits that we're
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
facing so I'm kind of concerned that
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from the judicial branch
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
which I have a great respect for that um
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're looking at potentially a 4% cut
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
in their budget and whether what you've
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
see seen from the court already have you
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
seen any sort
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
of slow up in cases because of the
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
volume and if so to me it would appear
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
that by suggesting the courts take a 4%
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
cut it may actually impact the
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
efficiency of handling these cases so
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of curious are you seeing
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
things move fairly quickly or as far as
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
the resolution of the cases before the
 
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:32.350 align:start position:0%
the resolution of the cases before the
court

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
it it sounds like your question is is
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
directed towards the case sure and and
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
sure Jen Foley general counsel for the
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
YDC um settlement fund um it sounds like
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
your question is about um cases pending
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
in court um and how quickly those are
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
moving um I can certainly that's a feir
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I can address with respect to
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
how quickly um the claims moving in the
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
settlement process but the with respect
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
to uh the litigation I would defer to
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
office hi I'm Laura Raymond from the
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office working uh on
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
the YDC claim fund um I also similarly
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
to attorney Foley um am not involved
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
day-to-day in the litigation matters and
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
rather am focused on the claim fund but
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding um that any
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
potential proposed um budgetary cuts to
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch are not having uh at
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
least a current impact on the status of
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
the litigated matters relating to YDC in
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
court um any more than um the other
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
factors uh that would affect the pace of
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
those cases not including of course the
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
volume but that the budget itself is not
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
having a specific impact at this point
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman thank you so I
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
guess in division one we haven't seen
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
any presentation yet as far as the
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
justice department that I'm aware of as
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
far as the budget are are you being
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
saddled with an unfair burden with
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
trying to handle all these cases I know
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
you like the court the court hasn't seen
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
any increase in staff and I don't
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
believe you've asked for any significant
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
increase in staff to handle this
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
mounting claim
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
process uh thank you for the question
 
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.630 align:start position:0%
process uh thank you for the question
representative

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
I we're we are presenting next we're
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
presenting on our budget and our
 
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.430 align:start position:0%
presenting on our budget and our
operations

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think I would not say that we're
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing an unfair burden I mean
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
YDC cases RIT large are quite an
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
undertaking for both the Judiciary and
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
our office and and the settlement fund
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
process that that's for sure but we we
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
have been utilizing a combination of
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
in-office resources and outside Council
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
to handle the YDC
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
litigation the spending on that has been
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent for the last few years
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
and so we are handling it it it's hard
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
work and people are working hard but I
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't describe the burden as unfair
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
and and I think we're prepared to
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
continue handling the work with the
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
budget that I anticipate will be put
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
before you that said I can't get out in
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
front of Governor aot she hasn't
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
presented her her budget yet so I would
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to get out in front of
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
her on that but I don't anticipate
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
issues on that front that said I just
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
want to give a shout out to the team and
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
to the administrator's office because
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
people are working very hard and we're
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
endeavoring to utilize resources as
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
efficiently as we can so it's hard work
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't describe it as an unfair
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
burden by any means all right thanks
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman make it clear the uh
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
honorable bradrick and his staff are on
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
your budget not the court budget until
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
correct the the the the settlement fund
 
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:56.599 align:start position:0%
dollars are technically yes appropriated
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Justice we
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
reimburse the judicial branch for any
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
costs that the administrator's office um
 
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
has so that that's technically correct
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
but the employees of the settlement
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
front process are technically employees
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch so it's a little
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
bit of a unique Arrangement so the money
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
is appropriated to us so I would say
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
they are technically on our budget
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
because that fund is appropriated to the
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
doj but that's that the settlement fund
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
though is is separate I would say from
 
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.069 align:start position:0%
though is is separate I would say from
our

00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
regular ongoing operating budget thank
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
you do you mind if I add just a little
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
bit of color to that uh so the fund
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
itself um uh pays for uh the the costs
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the administration so the
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
administrator broad's office and staff
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
and Consultants that is essentially
 
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
build to the fund and the Attorney
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
General's office is the one who um
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
essentially cuts the checks for those
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
costs um in addition to that um the
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
department of justice under the statute
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that there's some
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
extraordinary costs beyond their typical
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
budget um is also paid for under the
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
fund um and so the administrator and
 
00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
general formela work closely together on
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
on watching the just the costs of
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
administering the claims in addition to
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
um the awards and that are paid out from
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
itself if there's anything we can do in
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
the legislature please let us know uh
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
this is a big effect on the entire
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
budget we may be able to put some
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
something in perhaps another limit into
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
hb2 um we're happy to entertain some
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
limit to to what can be recovered rather
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
than these ridiculous uh multi-million
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
dollar settlements that we see they
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
don't seem to make any sense so if you
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
want us to put any further limits we're
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
hb2 Senator Rosal thank you so it seems
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
like you've got 600 or so pending claims
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
$500,000 if you if we continue on that
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
trajectory of average payout and I guess
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
part of my question is do you think we
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
will that seems to me like we're looking
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
at a $300 million total exposure going
 
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.790 align:start position:0%
at a $300 million total exposure going
forward

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
about is my math
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
right start okay I'll take the first
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
shot at that and I will let attorney
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
Raymond also add add her
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts I guess Senator I would start
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
by saying I can't argue with your math
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
go I I am a lawyer so I try never to
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
argue on the math front but um yeah the
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
average to this point has been about
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
$500,000 per resolution and and if you
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
were to multiply that by the pending
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
claims you would you would get the
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
number that that you just mentioned that
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
said I I
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
think as we go through the
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
claims it would be I think a mistake to
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
make any assumptions about where the
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
average resolution is is going to be it
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
could go down it it could go up um it it
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
just it really depends on on whether as
 
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
we get further into the claims that have
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
been filed we start to see less
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
meritorious claims or more meritorious
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
claims it it's difficult to make a
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
assumptions so I I would just caution on
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
that but if the average were to hold at
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
500,000 you can just multiply that by by
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
the number of claims that come in but I
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
based on what we have seen so far I
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
don't think we should assume that all of
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
the claims to come will look like the
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
claims that have been resolved to this
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
point they may
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
not as as you go forward and prosecute
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
the abusive forces
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
are we seeing a pattern there's so many
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
of them that claim both physical and
 
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
of them that claim both physical and
sexual

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
sexual
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
abuse is are we seeing a pattern is
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
there an exaggeration here over some of
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
these things on the people you you're
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting that that supposedly did the
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
abuse what what kind of numbers are you
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
seeing relative to the numbers that are
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
being accused of I mean these people
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
would have to spend hours every day
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
doing sexual abuse to see the numbers
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
that we see does doesn't jive in my
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
mind yeah I'm I'm a little bit Limited
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
in the detail I can go into on on that
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
but but I will say this based on what
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
I've seen in the criminal investigation
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
over the last three to four years and
 
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
based on what we have seen come through
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
the claims fund so far um I
 
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
I I am not surprised let me say it this
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
way by what we've seen in in the claims
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
fund because we've seen a lot of similar
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
allegations in the claims fund to what
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
we saw during the criminal investigation
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
and while we only bring we can only
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
bring criminal charges when we think we
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
can prove a case Beyond a reasonable
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
doubt that doesn't mean we haven't seen
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
a lot more allegations across the
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
decades that we may not have brought
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
criminal charges for so so far with the
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
240 two claims I believe that have been
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
resolved when I compare what we saw in
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
those claims to everything thing I've
 
00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
seen in the criminal investigation I
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
think the best the best way for me to
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
phrase it is I'm not surprised by what
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen there it seemed there there
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
is enough consistency between those two
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
groups that I'm not surprised beyond
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
that it's difficult for me to go into
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
much more detail and I would also just
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
again caution that there are a lot of
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
claims that will come into the claims
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
fund that we may not have even seen on
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
the criminal side yet and so I just
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
caution against making any assumptions
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
about the hundreds of claims to come and
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
what those will look like thank you
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%

00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%

report great thanks Christine good
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
morning uh So within your materials uh
 
00:44:29.549 --> 00:44:29.559 align:start position:0%
you'll see three reports um I will cover
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
each of those and then I will go through
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
the required Communications uh to the
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
committee under the auditing standards
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
so the first report in your materials is
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
the annual financial report of the
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
turnpike system and within that report
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
is our audit opinion uh which we issued
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
on December 23rd
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
2024 that uh audit opinion is an
 
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
unmodified opinion so also known as a
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
clean opinion um within that opin
 
00:44:59.069 --> 00:44:59.079 align:start position:0%
opinion it indicates that we conducted
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
our audit in accordance with generally
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
accepted auditing standards as well as
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
Government auditing standards and it
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
also indicates that management is
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately responsible for the accuracy
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the financial statements and we are
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for expressing an opinion on
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
statements in addition uh that opinion
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
also references uh what is known as a
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
yellow book report which is the another
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
report within your materials um also
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
known as the report on internal control
 
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
over financial reporting and compliance
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
in other matters and within that report
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
um there were no significant
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
deficiencies or material weaknesses um
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
that we identified during the course of
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
the turnpike audit and then lastly uh
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
the third report in your materials is
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
the debt compliance report um and that
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
report indicates that uh the turnpike is
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the provisions and
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
Covenants of the bond
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
resolutions um so all all good news to
 
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
report with respect to to um the audit
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
report reports uh and with that I will
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
go through the uh required
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
Communications as well under the
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
auditing standards so during the course
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
of the audit we did not identify any
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
significant unusual
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
transactions um we did identify one
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
uncorrected audit misstatement which uh
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
is consistent with prior years related
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
to The Trusted other post-employment
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
benefit plan um which is not the
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
liability is not recorded in the uh
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
Turnpike statements which is consistent
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
with the other Enterprise funds as as
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
well we did not identify any corrected
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
misstatements during the course of the
 
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
audit uh in addition um we did discuss
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh the significant accounting policies
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh with management during the course of
 
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
the audit and determin that they were
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable in addition uh we did
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
evaluate um accounting estimates during
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
the course of the audit and we also
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
determined those to be reasonable um
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
there were no sub subsequent events
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
identified there were no illegal Acts or
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
fraud that we identified during the
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
course of the audit uh there were no
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with laws or regulations
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh no disagreements with management uh
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
we were not aware of any consultation
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
with other
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
accountants um and it we did not um have
 
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:11.720 align:start position:0%
any difficult uh encounters or
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
situations um that required us to
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
consult you know internally um either um
 
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:19.400 align:start position:0%

information in the financial section of
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%

basic financial
 
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
statements auditing standards require
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we make a number of disclosures to
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
you these disclosures are similar to the
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
disclosures discussed by KPMG for the
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%

not go through each of them
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
individually however we can say that we
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
are satisfied with the cooperation of
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
the lottery staff in the progress of the

sufficient controls over the cost
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
allocation process the department did
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
not maintain an updated cost allocation
 
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.000 align:start position:0%

description of the mechanics behind the
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
cost allocation process and was
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately unable to provide a
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
recalculation of the cost allocations
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
performed by its cap 95 system for three
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
out of 45 items selected for review the
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
observation recommends a department
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
establish comprehensive and documented
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures for all cost
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
allocation financial accounting and

Reporting activities and also notes that
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
management should be able to calculate
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
and substantiate all costs invoiced to
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
its user
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
agencies did you want to ask a question
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
now representative Edward had a question
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair as long as the topic
 
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
is up I I i' I've I've read the
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh and the background
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
what what I'm missing is is a little bit
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the the so what factor um of course
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%
we want to do proper cost allocation but
 
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
in in the absence of of good reliable
 
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
repeatable cost allocation is the state
 
00:59:03.549 --> 00:59:03.559 align:start position:0%
losing any money or is this really about
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
arguing of who who picks up the check at
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
dinner I I they're recouping all the
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
costs but it's just more of are the
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
agencies being ACC accurately charged
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
so we're able we were unable to
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
recalculate some of those elction so it
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
therefore you can't be entirely certain
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the amount charged each agency
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
maybe it was too much maybe it was too
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
little maybe some of those costs should
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
have been allocated to another one but
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
it's all internal to the state this cost
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
allocation isn't reaching out to
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
external third parties and it's not
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
costing the state additional money it's
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
just a poor methodology is what I'm
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
hearing correct is yes okay thank
 
00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:52.029 align:start position:0%
hearing correct is yes okay thank
you

00:59:52.029 --> 00:59:52.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
um um on page 17 observation number two
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
recommends that the department expand
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
accounts payable policies and procedures
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
to ensure invoices paid or in compliance
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
with significant contract payment
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions the observation also
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
recommends that the department perform a
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
monthly reconciliation of the New
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first detail transaction
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
register to supporting documentation as
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
policy moving on to page 19 observation
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
number three recommends the department
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
establish policies and procedures for
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
assigning activity codes in New
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first for use and tracking
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures and employee Time by user
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
agency the policy should include a
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and descriptive listing of
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
the activity codes available for use or
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
specify the process to follow when the
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
choice of activity code is
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
unclear the observation also recommends
 
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
that the department of administrative
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
Services consider implementing a
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
security check to limit access to
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
activity codes within the time
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
management module similar to those used
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
feasible observation number four on page
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
21 identified SE segregation of Duties
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
weaknesses within the Department's
 
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
request and requisition system and
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
recommends that the department review
 
01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:15.039 align:start position:0%
the assignment of authorities within the
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
system to ensure employee approval
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
authorities are compatible and limited
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
to only those individuals requiring
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
access it also recommends a department
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
perform a periodic review of r and our
 
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.549 align:start position:0%
perform a periodic review of r and our
system

01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
authorities continuing on to page 22
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
observation number five noted that the
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
internal controls related to the
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
Department's telecommunication process
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
exhibited weaknesses that impacted its
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
ability to process telecommunications
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
revenues accurately efficiently and
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
timely the observation recommends the
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
department establish policies and
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
procedures governing the
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications process and adopt a
 
01:01:58.109 --> 01:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensive manual to conform with
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
statute the observation also recommends
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
the department ensure Duties are
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately segregated document the
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
basis for sear charges build to
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
customers and publish a comprehensive
 
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.309 align:start position:0%
customers and publish a comprehensive

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
schedule Additionally the department
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
should consider documenting the review
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
and approval of invoice batches in New
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first and consult with Das
 
01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the feasibility of
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
establishing an audit trail of invoice
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
observation number six on page
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
24 recommends that the department
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
strengthen controls over salaries and
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
benefits monitoring and review process
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
and also document the processes through
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
written policies and
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
procedures the department should also
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
develop document and Implement policies
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
and procedures covering employee
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
termination payouts to include a review
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
management question
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so the numbering
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
of these observations with this being
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
six number six is that meant to imply um
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
you what you think the priority for
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
fixes ought to be or is this just a a r
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
kind of more of a random numbering of
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
observations um we or ordered the
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
observations in terms
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
of the most impactful so like the ones
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
that we thought thought were most
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
important in order and so on down all
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
right this one reads to me like it may
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
be the most important but but okay thank
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
you I think um with the
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
telecommunication expend uh revenues and
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures um
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
they're less than the total doit
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
revenues and expenditures so there are
 
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:58.150 align:start position:0%
revenues and expenditures so there are
some

01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
you did I I defer to your judgment you
 
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
you guys do this for living I I just do
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay you on number six actually you just
 
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
finished number six I believe okay
 
01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.309 align:start position:0%
finished number six I believe okay
sorry

01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
um on page 26 observation number 7
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
recommends that the department establish

accounting and Reporting objectives the
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
process should include an IT security
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
risk assessment to ensure its
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
information assets are adequately
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
considered it also recommends the
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
department routinely review and
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
periodically test its continuity of

01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
practical observ number eight discusses
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
the lack sorry we're on page 28
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
discusses the lack of a consistent audit
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
Trail to evidence the review and
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
approval of invoice batches in New

Hampshire first and is also directed
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
toward the department of administrative
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
Services the observation recommends that
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
Das consider whether it should take
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
steps to implement an effective audit

invoice batches within New Hampshire
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
first and also recommends that doit
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
Implement policies and procedures to
 
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:26.839 align:start position:0%

M can you hear me now better better okay
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
you were trailing off okay
 
01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
sorry observation number nine on page 29
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
recommends that the department test its
 
01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
backup process at least annually as
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
outlined in its contingency
 
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.950 align:start position:0%
outlined in its contingency
planning

01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
policy um turning to page 30 observation
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
number 10 recommends that the department
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
prioritize the results of Prior audit
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
findings resulting from the 2018
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
performance audit and the 2006 Financial
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
audit of the office of Information
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
Technology and create a corrective
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
action plan for resolution as soon as
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
possible just a question just a comment
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
on that one uh I have been in
 
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
Communications with the governor's
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
office through the LBA about this it's a
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
an ongoing thing it's something that
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
I've complained about through the system
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh on other audits that there is not
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
sufficient tracking of the audit
 
01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
findings so that we know how they're
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
being done what they're being done and
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm told that Mr James Gary from the
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
governor's office will be the one in
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
charge not only of of these it audit
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
items but for the whole system to make
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
sure that there is progress being made
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
on those audit findings because it
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
repeating and repeating and repeating
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
these you know some of the most
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
egregious go back to
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
2006 and haven't been resolved but we've
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
been talking about them the staff that
 
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
involved in this I know that that the
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
people up here at this table are cheap
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know but the staff uh time that
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
it takes to repeat these is is
 
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous so we need to get them
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
resolved and put the attention that
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
needs to happen on to them thank you
 
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.670 align:start position:0%
needs to happen on to them thank you
thank

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
you um on page 32 observation number 11
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
question from Senator Waters thank you
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman on that on that same item on
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
number 10 that first reference to the uh
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
2006 audit I mean it takes me back to
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
Observation number one where we have
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
Department Ms that are under great
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
stress trying to complete their budgets
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
and not knowing whether they can rely on
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
the figures that they're supposed to
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
allocate for their technology and and
 
01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
observation number one it says that it's
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
an ongoing process so there's is there
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
any assurance that agencies can actually
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
depend on the accuracy of what they're
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
being build or is that it's going to
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
is that yeah okay sorry um during that
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
review of the costs that were allocated
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
to the agencies um it's very involved so
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
um costs that were allocated
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
using one method we found that those
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
were allocated correctly we were able to
 
01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
recalculate them and determine that they
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
were accurate um where it gets more
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
complicated is when the system allocates
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
costs using a method within a method so
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
then you have to take one
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
method um use that and the other method
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
and allocate those costs and that's
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
where we found the struggle where we
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
weren't able to fully recalculate those
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
costs and the cap 95 system is doing
 
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
costs and the cap 95 system is doing
that

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
um so for what we found it was three out
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
of 45 so for the vast for the majority
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
of them we were confident in that those
 
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
costs were allocated properly but for a
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
small piece of them it would be harder
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
question do you have any sense of how
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
far off the errors may be are we talking
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
about large variations potentially or
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
relatively small ones it wasn't
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily that there were errors it's
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
just that we couldn't get an
 
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the system was
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
calculating allocating those costs so we
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't recalculate it so it could very
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
well be accurate but we just couldn't
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
determine that because we couldn't
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
get a good understanding of the process
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
to do the calculation so I understand
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
that so does that mean that you really
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
have no idea how far off they could be
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
for those particular ones correct and
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
those particular ones are particularly
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
significant sorry I can continue
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't have in I I don't have in
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
front of me right now I could find that
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
information for you but I don't I have
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
that information right at this moment I
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
think it'd be really helpful if we get
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
an order of magnitude idea of how
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
serious these problems are are um
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
especially they go back for whatever um
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
decades if that's possible okay um
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner goule I think will address
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
that um in his comments he's
 
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.070 align:start position:0%
that um in his comments he's
saying

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
saying
okay

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm on oh thank
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
you sorry uh on page 32 observation
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
number 11 recommends the adoption of
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules as required by
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
Statute if the department deems
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unnecessary
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
statutory rision should be
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
requested on page 33 observation number
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
12 recommends the department seek to
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
amend statute to clarify unclassified
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
position titles and ensure division
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
directors are being compensated
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
correctly and also to consult with Das
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
to determine if F further statutory
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
revision regarding its 10th unclassified
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
position is necessary the department
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
should also seek clarification from TS
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
or the Attorney General to determine
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
whether employees working a 40-hour week
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
classified question is this is this uh
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for taking the question
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
is observation 12 really tightly related
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
to Observation six or is it is this just
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh Bas basically a specific example of
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the problem that six presents
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
observation six had to do with
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the payroll so more with
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
um monitoring of the bi-weekly payroll
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
process and and the cost and observation
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
number 12 has to do with um the
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
department has some unclassified
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
positions that aren't clearly defined in
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
the statute like it will just say
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
director versus the specific director so
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
observation 12 is really aimed at
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
um being more clear in the statute so
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we can be able to determine that a
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
specific division director's pay was
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
accurate so all right uh well thank you
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
these these Personnel issues to me get
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
to be very significant just for the
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
system okay on page 36 observation
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
number 30 um 13 notes that the
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
department dep did not complete timely
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
performance evaluations for 60% of the
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
employees selected for review it
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
recommends that the department comply
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
with statute and administrative Rule and
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
perform timely annual performance
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
reviews for all full-time classified
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
employees um finally observation number
 
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
14 on page 37 recommends that the
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
department ensure by annual reports are
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
Statute the appendix beginning on page
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
39 9 reports on the current status of
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
Prior audit Bings the status key on page
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
47 shows 12 audit bindings are fully
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
resolved while nine are in the process
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
of remediation and 10 remain unresolved
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
this concludes my
 
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
presentation I'd like to thank the
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the department of
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
Information Technology staff as well as
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:13:49.149 --> 01:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
services for their cooperation
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the audit and I'll now turn
 
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
the presentation over to commissioner
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
gulay for any comments he might have
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
well commissioner good morning uh
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Dennis goule I'm
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
Information Technology I want to start
 
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
by thanking the LBA audit staff they're
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
professional and thorough and and uh um
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
you know we we do did enjoy working with
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
them um so first of all I want to say
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
that we do care about this stuff and we
 
01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
you know we're taking what we see here
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
seriously we've already started working
 
01:14:26.189 --> 01:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
on all of these items some of them are
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
close to resolution or are in in process
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
um so I'll I'll talk about some of the
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
more important ones because um the the
 
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
cap 95 the allocation methodology uh
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
software that we're using is is
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
Antiquated um we we went through many
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
years with without um actually uh
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
prioritizing funding to replace that and
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh so we're in the process now of
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
running um we've actually been um thanks
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
to a capital appropriation in recent
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
bium where we implemented a project to
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
replace that system with a more modern
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
system that actually has the
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
transparency that we require for those
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
more complex um allocation methods the
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
three of 45 that were described um right
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
now we're running that system in
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
parallel um we're planning on cutting it
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
over at at
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
the the uh fiscal year boundary uh the
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
numbers are coming out so the the
 
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
numbers are coming out the same on the
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
new system as the old system right now
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
and it gives us confidence that our
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
those allocation methodologies that were
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
in question um can be uh can be counted
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
on and additionally one of the things
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've uh We've uh asked for the vendor
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
to help us with is providing that level
 
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
of transparency that I think has been
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
lacking at least for you know from my
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
perspective I think if you asked an
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
agency Finance person as well you know
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
you know what what's all this mean and
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
why is am I getting charged this amount
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
so so while while I um I think the the
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
LBA Auditors are correct in you know
 
01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
when they see those methodologies and
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
they can't back into how that number
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
came about I think that's absolutely
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
correct uh we will be able to do that
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
and and I think for me the fact that
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the same allocations come
 
01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
out on the new system as the old system
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
is builds some confidence um that that
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
system is also the the system is called
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
CAP plus it's B basically a new version
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
we we did a competitive procurement on
 
01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
that found that cost effectively um for
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
us we we actually don't spend a lot of
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
money on our own technology it's kind of
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
the like the landscaper in their yard
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
but um in this case I think it's
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
important and you and we will be um you
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
know going live on that barring any
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
unforeseen things going live on that on
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
the uh fiscal year boundary um
 
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
so um the uh one one of the other
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
factors I think is and and a mitigating
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
factor I wanted to share is that a lot
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
of if you peel back the onion on a lot
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
of these findings what it what it comes
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
down to is we we may be doing
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
something correctly or nearly correctly
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
but we can't prove it through policy or
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
documentation and so we're a couple
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
years into a new program in doit where
 
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
we're completely revamping our um you
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
know our policies and procedures and and
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
and we actually assign staff to do that
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
staff who used to be working on you know
 
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
more not the same people but you know
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
authoriz positions that used to be
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
working on more technical stuff to to
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
focus on that and we've made a lot of
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
progress but where we we hadn't really
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
focused them on this particular stuff
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
previously we were more focused on the
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
federal financial audits that we were
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
getting which we were pretty much
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
continuously audited so um you know both
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
on the financial side as well as on the
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
operational cyber security uh and and um
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
continuity operation side so we could
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
share with you audit findings but our
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
findings from the feds have been pretty
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
good lately and we we will and that came
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
about mostly because we were focusing on
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
making sure we were paying attention to
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
and and updating our own policies and
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
then following them so we're going to do
 
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
that here as well we've already started
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
that process both on the payroll side um
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
as well as on the accounts payable and
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
some of the other stuff that was found
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
in this in this in these findings um and
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
going to um representative Edwards
 
01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
concern around item six and then the
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
other item which was really more of a
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
legislative change the I think it was up
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
12 I think um so on 12 that's we had we
 
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
did ask James Jerry to put um some
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
language in House Bill too to square
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
that away to me that's just getting
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
document what how things exist today and
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
and so that assuming you know at some
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
point if it remains in house bill to and
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
if that passes that particular finding
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
will be taken care of except for one
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
piece which is the when doit was formed
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
there were people came in as classified
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
37 and 1 half hour people and there are
 
01:18:59.790 --> 01:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
people that came in a small number of
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
them as 40-hour people so what we're
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to do to address that over time so
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
that one's going to hang out for a while
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
because as people retire we'll just stop
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
you know we won't refill that position
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
as a non-compliant position we'll fill
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
it as a compliant whatever is compliant
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
at that time assuming we do refill the
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
position um so and with respect to item
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
six um we're not making major mistakes
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
on paying people we're not making can
 
01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
make major mistakes on paying out people
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
but what you what you can see in the in
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
the findings is that you have a a
 
01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
separation of Duties issue there well we
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
got to make sure that somebody else can
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
say that and and there has to be a
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
policy and procedure that you know that
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we follow that is rigorous so that
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
we can prove it and that's what we're
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
working on in fact as soon as we saw
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
this we started working on that and I
 
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
expect to have that resolved soon and U
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
so sorry I could comment on every one of
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
these but I don't want to take up your
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
time I want you to get to ask about the
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
ones you're most concerned with so I'll
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
be quiet now and take
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
lean I'd just like to Second what
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
Senator gray said earlier um a number of
 
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
these issues dealing with billing and
 
01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
fraud issues date back to like
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
2006 and haven't been addressed so my
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
concern is we have the LBA doing this
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
work pointing out these issues and some
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
of them are holdovers from 10 years ago
 
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
so I again as Senator gray said we
 
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
should be getting on these a little
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
quicker than we are yes I I agree and
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
and there's really no excuse I won't I'm
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
not going to make an excuse for that I
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
will say we've been working on that
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
particular the the one cost allocation
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
one we've been working on that since I
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
joined in 2015 and things just take a
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
while sometimes funding and and ability
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
to deliver but I agree with you that you
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
know those the the fact that we hadn't
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know dealt with those two
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
2006 um audit findings which predate Me
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
by nine years so you know and I've been
 
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
here almost 10 now so it's a it's pretty
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
for Senator waters for a question thank
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you um so back
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
to 2006 the uh recommendation about
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
having memoranda of understanding with
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
agencies on Services um do you think
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
that that's necessary or is that
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
something that you you think should be
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
done done or should not be done I mean I
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
I so I'm concerned about what I when I
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
when I discuss with agencies about the
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
arrangements with information technology
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
issues come up and I I'm unclear as to
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
how what kind of I'll share my thoughts
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
on that in and so we have a an
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
Enterprise approach to things so we
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
don't want we don't generally and you
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
know every every agency is different and
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
their requirements are different so
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
obviously you have to take that into
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
account and um and again that relates
 
01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
back to the federal audits which are all
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
potentially different based on which you
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
know which federal agency and and and
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
the agency in question who's being
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
audited um but with respect to a
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding or what we
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
would what I would call a service level
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
agreement no way in no way do I think a
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
service level agreement should be
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
different for every agency I we wouldn't
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
be able to do that um we run pretty lean
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have a big staff and um but
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
what what I how we operate is Baseline
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
plus so what we try to do is every
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
agency is a little different in in terms
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
of their tolerance for any
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
downtime and so structuring our service
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
approach with a baseline service level
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
agreement and then different things for
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
different agencies for example we have a
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
a 7x24 365 on call program that agencies
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
can choose to buy into if they want what
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
happens there is those folks who are on
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
call at any given time which include
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
folks who can fix network problems
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
system problems and other other types of
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
problems um are being paid for under the
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the collective bargain
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
agreement to be on call all the time and
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
so some agencies buy into that because
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the importance of their you know
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
being able to respond within a you know
 
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:17.719 align:start position:0%
really quickly at any time day or night
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
some don't and that's an example of a
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
variable service level agreement for
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
agencies um in the in case of some of
 
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
our other businesses like for example
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
you got you know Charlie from Lottery
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
was up here he has specific contracts
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
for you know the machines all around the
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
state that are super strict because of
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
the potential Revenue implications of
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
you know having one of those down or
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
more than one of those down so so um
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
I've resisted a you know service level
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
agreements or orus with each agency and
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
I will continue to do that um because I
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a good idea I think get
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
a solid Baseline and then do do um uh
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know tweaks by agency based on um
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
needs and then again there's a funding
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
issue you know I I'll be able to do what
 
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
I'm able to do based on the funding as
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
factor representative Edwards uh thank
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you uh Mr
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner this this is a this is
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
actually meant to be a helpful question
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at page nine at The
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and I see that the uh it
 
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
council is established under a statute
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
um and that it's it's meant twice in two
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
and a half years and it just makes me
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
wonder aloud and and to get your
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
feedback um did is this Advisory Board
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
actually useful uh is it adding value is
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
there something we should be looking at
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
to to to change the statute um I I'm I'm
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
just curious this didn't show up in a
 
01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
finding but meeting twice and two an a
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
half years sort of flashes a red light
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
if that it's not quite right yeah we we
 
01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
did so during Co and and for some period
 
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
of time after Co we were heads down
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
surviving and um and and the fact that
 
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.550 align:start position:0%
surviving and um and and the fact that
that

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
strategic body who would be if you look
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
prior to that on our website you'll see
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we were meeting you know two to
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
four times a year we were you know
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
generating activities including you know
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
multiple strategic plans and things like
 
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
that cyber security cyber security
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
activities uh it's a very important body
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
I think I think it's the overall or
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
should be anyway the overall governing
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
body for me uh to help guide what doit
 
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
is doing for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
and um so um we have we're working on
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
scheduling another one we're in the
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
process of revising our now
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
three-year-old strategic plan which
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
We'll be asking that body to help to to
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
ratify so um I I think um and I did
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
notice that um uh a senator was added to
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
U uh in the I think it was in the last
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
session uh to which I had had asked for
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
but had been led to believe in committee
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't happen but it looks like
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
it did happen I'd be you know the one
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is that having um
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get two house members to a
 
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
meeting is difficult so if I had four
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
house members on the committee then
 
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
getting two to a meeting at any given
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
time would be easier that's the one
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
thing I would potentially say but I I
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
like the transparency I like having the
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
ability to um get input both from both
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
the the legislature and my peers around
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
the department heads who are members as
 
01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:43.719 align:start position:0%
well as folks from outside which
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
includes higher ed County government
 
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
city government and the private
 
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
sector thank
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
you commissioner goule you have items 11
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
and 12 calling for legislative
 
01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
and 12 calling for legislative
action

01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
so if you get some proposal to to me in
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
the next four or five weeks I can
 
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
include it in hb2 okay so it would
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
become law we'll do one one of those
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to pass that was in
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
the performance audit we've had it we've
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
had language in in um and it ended up I
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
think a couple times in one time it was
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
was in an omnius bill that didn't pass
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
and another time um it it didn't pass
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
because the committee didn't like it but
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
um my my approach to this and I'd be
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
happy to chat with anybody is is you
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
know I don't think doit should be a
 
01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
rulle making entity I think we should be
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
governed under under you know 21r
 
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
whatever we should be doing and and and
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
stick with that and that was the essence
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the language and I think that was
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
what the contention for on the committee
 
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
was in terms of uh cuz there's ambiguity
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
we we have stuff we have stuff to find
 
01:27:59.070 --> 01:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
in 21r that kind of says what we should
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
do and then we say and then we have that
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
other language which I'd like to strike
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
which says we should be making rules and
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I in my opinion I don't think we
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
need to be making rules so we'll we'll
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
send language over and and thank you
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
very much for that offer since that
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
experience that you've had it turned
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
down have they given you good reasoning
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
that you can amend it to some degree
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
good so if you send us the proposal we
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
will be able to put it in HP too thank
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%

having uh accepted the report and placed
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
it on file so we don't need to make that
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
any further uh since it already has been
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%

third Friday tried to meet on the third
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
Friday of the month that would um put
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%

for me since I have u a long time
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled County meeting tomorrow on
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
Friday but Friday the 21st works for me
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
how about the rest of you
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
it it it works for me just as a footnote
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
people may want to realize that's before
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
the winter break not that any of us are
 
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
going to break but that's the Friday
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
before the winter break
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
y i just note that um Mr chairman uh
 
01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:13.719 align:start position:0%
that is the same time as the governor's
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
commission Alcohol and Other Drugs which
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
both um represent I serve on but so it
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
may be on I'll try to be here as a
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
priority but on an occasion I may need
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
to substitute now what time does the
 
01:30:27.629 --> 01:30:27.639 align:start position:0%
alcohol commission meet it's 9:30 to
 
01:30:27.639 --> 01:30:29.149 align:start position:0%
alcohol commission meet it's 9:30 to
11:30

01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
11:30
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
9:30 I would also mention that the
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
oversight Commission on children's
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
services meets at 9
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
o' if we put it in the afternoon would
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
better as a personal problem I think I
 
01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:49.719 align:start position:0%
have HHS oversight in the afternoon but
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
but we'll figure it out if that's what
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
you decide what time you think that
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be in the afterno it starts at 1
 
01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.070 align:start position:0%
would be in the afterno it starts at 1
you

01:30:57.070 --> 01:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
know how long how long does it usually
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
go uh if I am not asking questions it
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
takes an
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
hour is it in this room no uh no sir no
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay you're on that as
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
inconvenience Mr Kane I can leave it up
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
to the committee um Fridays are going to
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
be difficult
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh for fiscal just because we do also
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
have historically yes um you have a new
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
education funding committee that meets
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
on in the morning too I I can't say
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're going to meet
 
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
that Friday so it'll have to be a case
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
by case every month I don't know if at
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
11:00 a.m. works on Friday the 21st for
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
those members who have 9:30 meetings or
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
not um because I know there are
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon meetings I don't anticipate a
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
huge agenda in February uh which I so
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be too 11 will be good 11 11
 
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
