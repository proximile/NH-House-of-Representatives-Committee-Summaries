00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh no I brought a pen I got a pen
 
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.289 align:start position:0%
 
doctors

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
right why I actually have a sort of a
 
00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment myself at three
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock I have to go to Bow to get my
 
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 align:start position:0%
new inserts from my shoes
 
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
and he tells me to bring he just says
 
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 align:start position:0%
bring all your shoes I had this giant
 
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
laundry thing and and just as I was
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
getting into my car I looked up and
 
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
there was my golf clubs you know my golf
 
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
shoes and I said better bring those too
 
00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the insertion so
 
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
all right we're doing health insurance
 
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
all right first up is HB 343 relative to
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
billing for ambulance services
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
so I got the email I got
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
um from
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
um I think it was ncsl was their
 
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 align:start position:0%
somewhat model legislation
 
00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.749 align:start position:0%
somewhat model legislation
and

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
and it would have been nice but I
 
00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 align:start position:0%
started reading like a
 
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
how did this one fly but it didn't solve
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
the what I have found is the the biggest
 
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
problem we've had with it is that the
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies want
 
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
to balance bill
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
that that's that was the pushback we
 
00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
were getting and I think there was on
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
even on your side of the aisle was that
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
some some of the fire departments they
 
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
want to be able to to to do that back
 
00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 align:start position:0%
billing so but well we got Joyce you're
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
right on with that uh the Fire Chiefs um
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
are not in favor of having us take away
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
their ability to get some extra money
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
um so that is is PR we don't want
 
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
balanced building because that's a
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
concern it's not technically about
 
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's consumer issue but um up North
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is really a rural problem it's
 
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
really yes absolutely
 
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
um we're we're facing a situation where
 
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
um the small towns can't afford to
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
maintain an ambulance and also to staff
 
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
it so so
 
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
um there is a possibility of well we've
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
had a we floated a few ideas like
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
um doing a pool of money with fees to
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
help the people who can't afford it or
 
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 align:start position:0%
combining towns together
 
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh but each town is about 10 square
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
miles so if you happen to be on there
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're really straight out and you have a
 
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
heart attack it could take an hour for
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
the ambulance to get to you
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
um so this is I I think looking at what
 
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
NCL and and CSL whatever it is
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
um whatever they come up with is a good
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
idea because this is going on in Montana
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
and Iowa and all of the states that have
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
rural populations
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
um now uh I think that the bill that we
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
worked on with all the different
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
possibilities for amendments is pretty
 
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.249 align:start position:0%
possibilities for amendments is pretty
much

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
um shredded at this point but Anita has
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
offered to kind of pick up the the torch
 
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
on that along with some other people do
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think the most significant
 
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
thing that I learned I I talked to and
 
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
her name is is escaping me at this point
 
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Hospital Association
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
she said this bill is way too
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
complicated and you are never going to
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
get from last time
 
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.300 align:start position:0%
get from last time
but

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.930 align:start position:0%
but
[Laughter]

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 align:start position:0%
um she said you're not going to get it
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
passed as is but maybe break it down and
 
00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:34.099 align:start position:0%
I thought that was a brilliant idea so
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
so you know I think that that's the way
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
to go is for us to to to go to something
 
00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:40.909 align:start position:0%
to go is for us to to to go to something
smaller

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
um again as as Joy said that would
 
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
impact this maybe help the smaller towns
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
that might be the way to go right okay
 
00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:48.170 align:start position:0%
that might be the way to go right okay
and

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair
 
00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:50.990 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair
um

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
anybody that does bring forth the
 
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
legislation too there was a study
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
committee four summers ago I think it
 
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
was there's a lot of information from
 
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
testimony from stakeholders and that
 
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
should maybe in this report we can kind
 
00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
of um just reference that so that people
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
know where to go to get some of the
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
information so they don't have to
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
reinvent you know all the way from the
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
beginning but it would
 
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated issue there
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
aren't any easy answers the insurance
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
companies have got to be part of this
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
and um but the report should reflect
 
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
that we've had a study I can't remember
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
if it was a committee or commission so
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
who Joyce are you guys
 
00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:36.539 align:start position:0%
who should make the motion then
 
00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.670 align:start position:0%
who should make the motion then
um

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
I would recommend that this has further
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislation oh further well no no future
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
has a future this bill I think we should
 
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
just yeah that's what I'm saying I don't
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
know basically we want to send the
 
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
message that this language yeah it's not
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
probably you can write in your saying is
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
that we still think this needs to be
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
resolved but this bill is not
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
recommended yeah I'll be happy to do
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
that okay could we ask can we hear from
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
Paula just briefly of course come on up
 
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.850 align:start position:0%
Paula just briefly of course come on up
Paul

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
Paul
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
so while she's coming up I want to let
 
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
you all know that uh as a member of
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county we are now going to be a
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
little more intimately involved in this
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
issue because the county has taken its
 
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
rapid funds and is now offering the
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
ambulance services for all our small
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
towns so I'll I'll be even more plugged
 
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
into what the issues are here uh but I
 
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
kept saying to them I said uh you do
 
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
know there's a problem you know out
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
there and they were a key you know
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
keenly aware of it so hopefully but it
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
was the hospital or the hospital was
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
really concerned about the ambulance
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
service that we had in Keene and they
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
were very happy that we did this
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
good morning Paul good morning chairman
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
hunt um for the record Paula minahan
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:09:59.449 --> 00:09:59.459 align:start position:0%
answer any questions or speak but I I do
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
believe it is a rural issue as
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs and I discuss
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
and I know um representative Weston and
 
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
I have discussed this in the past I
 
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
one idea is to bring the stakeholders
 
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.829 align:start position:0%
one idea is to bring the stakeholders
together

00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
now and talk through this and I think
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
the municipal association should be part
 
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
of this because it is an issue for towns
 
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that they have been
 
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.250 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that they have been
involved

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
um but maybe there is a solution or a
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
targeted solution
 
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:34.700 align:start position:0%
for the um for the volunteer
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
groups you know throughout the rural
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
areas of the state because I think it
 
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
really is a rule issue primarily I'm not
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
certainly an expert on this but like you
 
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.350 align:start position:0%
certainly an expert on this but like you
said

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt to the extent that the
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
hospitals are involved sometimes they um
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
they I mean obviously they know when
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
there are problems when they can't have
 
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
access to
 
00:10:59.569 --> 00:10:59.579 align:start position:0%
um prompt EMS services so they certainly
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
are care about this issue a lot they
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
just don't necessarily have a financial
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
stake in these services but they
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
certainly care about them because they
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
they provide services to their
 
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.550 align:start position:0%
they provide services to their
facilities

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
and and I know that you've been around
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
and Paula I think is probably Paul and I
 
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
have both been around this this uh his
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
track many many many times but um the
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know the fundamental problem is that
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
these ambulance companies don't want to
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
sign contracts with the insurance
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
companies right right so that again
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's to the that was why I made the
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
comment that this is complicated because
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's it is um there are a lot of factors
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
well that's why I was arguing this is
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
like a balanced billing problem which is
 
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
those right those those uh practitioners
 
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
that weren't signing contracts with
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
insurance companies right no I and I do
 
00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:51.530 align:start position:0%
insurance companies right no I and I do
recall

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
recall
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
um representative Bartlett morning I
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
remember that that study committee as
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
well and I'm sure
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
um Paula Rogers recalls it as well I'm
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
sure I have a file on it somewhere back
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
at the office yeah so I you're right
 
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
there is some good information that came
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
out of that and I'm sure archives if
 
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's not on gen Court I'm sure archives
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
has it but they probably it probably is
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
in archives because I was thinking
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
summer 2016. does that sound right
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
I possibly it goes back a while yeah it
 
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.030 align:start position:0%
I possibly it goes back a while yeah it
does

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right yeah um and like Paul
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
is right there were periodic discussions
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
about this um but it was always 20 years
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
ago I mean I feel like I first time
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
we've had this was yeah even when you
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
first started getting had your job at
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
the end of ideas I remember it was one
 
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
of the first times so it's it's been
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
over 20 years this is not around
 
00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:46.730 align:start position:0%
over 20 years this is not around
so

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
okay okay anybody else one more time
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
anybody yes representative uh thank you
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
um say again and remind everyone that
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
this is an issue of of extreme
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
importance to the Lincoln Woodstock
 
00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:03.019 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service which is a volunteer
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
Service uh
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what uh 503 it is but it
 
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
is independent from uh the towns of the
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
fire department but it's a very small
 
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
service and without the ability to back
 
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
Bill a lot of our business we're ski
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
town a lot of our business is out of
 
00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.310 align:start position:0%
town a lot of our business is out of
Staters

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and can be uh fairly expensive a
 
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:32.300 align:start position:0%
rescue missions so they need the ability
 
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
to backfill and I'm sure the director of
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
that service or anyone would be willing
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
to serve on any kind of a committee or
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
certainly give feedback as to how
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
important it is to Lincoln and Woodstock
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
do you agree representative ham that it
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
would be the municipal Association that
 
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:52.100 align:start position:0%
probably would be a good
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
stakeholder to reach out to I I do
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
believe okay that would be
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
um a good uh resource because many times
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
it is a an arm of the municipality Yeah
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
in our case it is not oh okay okay but I
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
agree that they probably should have
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
some input okay thank you
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Burroughs I
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask publicly if representative
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
Hamm would join me in working on this I
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
I asked I would be honored to I'd be
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
perfect okay anybody else
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
all right so representative Wesson will
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
move that uh we we hope that something
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
will come in the future but at this
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
point this particular Bill uh in this
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
form cannot work all right uh Senate
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 287 relative to pounds billing for
 
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
certain Health Care Services
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
maybe not then we solve Health then we
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
solve balance building what did this
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
bill do anybody anybody remember what
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
Michelle Heaton from the New Hampshire
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
insurance department this was a bill
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
originally brought on behalf of the
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
insurance department what we were trying
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
to do is there's the national no
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
surprises act that solves a lot of the
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
balance billing issues what this bill is
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do is take a lot of what's in
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
the no surprises act and put it into New
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law where we got held up last
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
term was over
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
um the dispute resolution mechanism
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
right under no surprises act there's a
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
federal dispute resolution right process
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
and then that was being challenged in
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
court the court throughout part of it
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
since and our bill what we were
 
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
proposing is take out that National
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
process and instead use the process that
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
we already have projects right where the
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
commissioner would determine what the
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable rate is
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
right um since then
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
of the feds have redone the rules to
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
address the issue that came up in the
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
court so that's kind of where we're at
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
but the Department's position is we
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
still think this bill is good and
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
important and we'd like to see it too in
 
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
its current form
 
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
its current form
um

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
I think there was an amendment we were
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
going to propose at some point but this
 
00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:28.850 align:start position:0%
going to propose at some point but this
is

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
the version I think we initially wanted
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
there were some amendments that we were
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
talking about but then it ended up
 
00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:34.910 align:start position:0%
talking about but then it ended up
getting

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
um expedient to legislate so those I
 
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
don't think happened no it's not exp
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
this is interim study so yeah interim we
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
didn't kill it yeah completely it went
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
interim study so not all of them that we
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
had been discussing at the time
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily made it in but I think the
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
current version is the version that the
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
department would be most in favor of
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
okay but in addition to the dispute
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
resolution process there's some other
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
stuff in here that's also helps align
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statutes but no surprises
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
act the dispute resolution process with
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
just one part okay remind me who who you
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
are you you have your Michelle heat and
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
I'm the health you're the new okay law
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
and policy legal counsel okay
 
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
I guess my memory was that the insurance
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
companies were concerned about these two
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
different statutes conflicting with each
 
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
providers had a problem the providers or
 
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:42.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
but of course the hospital Association
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:51.299 align:start position:0%
hello again
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
um Paula from the hospital Association
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
Paul I'm in the hand um we so the
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
version that actually crossed over from
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate to here is a amended version
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
um that we were supportive of because it
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
took out the dispute the controversial
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
parts and um Michelle's right their
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution is what we were
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
um we also do not believe this bill is
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
necessary because we have the federal no
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
surprises act legislation and there is a
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
federal dispute resolution process
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
outlined and Michelle's also right um
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
that there are new rules that came out
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
as a result of some of the questions and
 
00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
concerns raised at the federal level so
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
our position remains that we don't
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
believe this is necessary and what is
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
important to note is the consumer is
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
protected from balance billing that is
 
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
right now they're protected that we
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
without this bill so we don't believe
 
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
this bill is that's our position that we
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't believe this bill is necessary and
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns about having the
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:04.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
retained and ultimately with one
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
individual in the department of
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
insurance not that we have anything to
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
against the commissioner it's just the
 
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
um the structure is problematic for
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
providers since we are not the hospitals
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
and the providers are not regulated by
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay so you're saying you would rather
 
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
have the federal statute than the state
 
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
at this point yes unless we were able to
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
um and we did we tried we had multiple
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
meetings with the department and the
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
carriers and some of the legislators
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
um during in the Senate discussions so
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
some of the Senators to try to get to a
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
position where we could all agree but we
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
just couldn't get to that point but
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
again the important thing is without
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
this bill the consumer is protected from
 
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:04.580 align:start position:0%
balance billing because of the federal
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
law so that's our that's why we don't
 
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:09.620 align:start position:0%
believe it's necessary
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I'll play The Devil's
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
Advocate on this and that is as long as
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
the federal law is out there then the
 
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
state law is you anyways
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
the way the no surprise of the Act was
 
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
um drafted is a lot of States including
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had some bound spilling
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
projections already in place okay so if
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
a state has laws regarding balance
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
billing the state law will apply if they
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
don't have something on the books to
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
cover a specific situation then the
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
federal law applies so in a way it's a
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
reverse preemption almost but it's to
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
preserve state laws that were already in
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
place but the more protective law is
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
going to apply so what we're trying to
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
do is make it so the New Hampshire
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
insurance department has more authority
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
over surprise billing so when something
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
isn't going as it should we don't have
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
to wait for the federal government to
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
take action and the department would be
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
in a better position to help enforce
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
some of those Provisions yeah I guess I
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
would lean to say yes I think having it
 
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
closer to home is a better resolution
 
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.070 align:start position:0%
closer to home is a better resolution
system

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern is is it would is
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh is there a con confusion because the
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
two of them are out there and that you
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
know when things get bogged down over
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
just a debate on on who really has
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction whether it's the federal or
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
it has jurisdiction because we do
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
already have a balanced Building Law
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
right not applies to certain things so
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
depending on which situation there's the
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
whole analysis we need to go through
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
right now to say well does the
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
department have jurisdiction does the
 
00:21:56.049 --> 00:21:56.059 align:start position:0%
federal government have to jurisdiction
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
it needs to be clarified yeah and part
 
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
other parts of this that are included um
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
prohibit providers and give oplc for
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
example the authority and the boards to
 
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
discipline providers who are violating
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
the balance billing laws whereas right
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
now it's the federal government that
 
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
would have to do that which is a much
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
lengthier process okay so have we had
 
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
any cases yet
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
so federally there have been about 40
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
000 cases have gone through no I mean in
 
00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in New Hampshire we have
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
not so we it doesn't matter it's whether
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's state or federal we haven't had any
 
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
cases at all we have had consumer
 
00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
complaints a couple of them about bound
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
spilling instances but no one has used
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
our dispute resolution system that
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
covers those four Specialties so they
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
all ended up using the federal one
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
yeah but we don't know to what extent
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a breakdown for
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
the federal process by how many per
 
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.390 align:start position:0%
the federal process by how many per
state

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
yes represent Grayson
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair if if somebody uh has
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
a complaint and they use the state's
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
resolution process they're not satisfied
 
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
with that can they or is there a
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
provision that allows them to then use
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
the federal dispute system or or in
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
Reverse no so I'll just lay out the two
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
different systems so the state system is
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
when the provider and the insurer do not
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
agree on what a reasonable rate is to be
 
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.870 align:start position:0%
agree on what a reasonable rate is to be
paid

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
um they're instructed to try to work it
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
out if they can't they can petition the
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner to have a hearing
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
on the matter they'll present evidence
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then the insurance commissioner
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
would ultimately decide what the
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate is that is binding on
 
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
them and the commissioner has exclusive
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction under the federal process
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
there's an independent dispute
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
resolution entity where each side
 
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
there's um very specific time limits if
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
you don't fall within that you're out
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
but um assuming you do you file
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
everything each side submits their
 
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
number of what they think is the
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate rate and then they can
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
submit evidence about certain factors
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
and then that independent dispute
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
resolution entity picks one or the other
 
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
and that's done there is no appeal in
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
the federal system either
 
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um I'm pretty sure you guys will
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
have somebody remember obviously
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
representative Weston won't be here but
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
I know representative Leno is going to
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
be running again and he cares he was
 
00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:33.539 align:start position:0%
very much involved with the balance
 
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
billing issue
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
that was in this one but that that the
 
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
issue and he was the Prime sponsor of
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
the original balance building statute so
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he cares and he'll put in
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm sure and at that point
 
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
in time I hope you guys will come in to
 
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
what's been going on uh you know in
 
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
terms of what's happening in the state
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
but I mean I I guess part of me feels
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
like this is if there are very minimal
 
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
problems have occurred then that means
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
our statute was good it it it seemed to
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
keep everybody happy but
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I I they're part of me that feels
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
like that if the federal government was
 
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
willing to let us run it I I think it's
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
better for our New Hampshire consumers
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to make a call you know here
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
locally rather than having to rely on a
 
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
federal statute so I think there's
 
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
something to be said for it but at this
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
point in time this bill is you know we
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
need we need more work on this bill
 
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.010 align:start position:0%
need we need more work on this bill
representative

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
just just so I understand
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
who has authority over the hospitals is
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
it the insurance department or is it no
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
it'd be CMS the federal government
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
oversees it DHHS does some oversight of
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
it but a lot of it um falls on CMS as
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
well so there's depending on what the
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
issue is I believe it's joint
 
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.769 align:start position:0%
issue is I believe it's joint
jurisdiction

00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
but the insurance department has no
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
Authority with the balanced billing
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
situations it specifically gives the
 
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner The Authority in these
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
specific disputes to mediate this law to
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
resolve the dispute between them but
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we do not have
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
authority over them
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
I do okay so if we're gonna go not
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
recommend who's gonna make the motion
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
who you want to you'll take care of that
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:21.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 121 relative to
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
state-based Health Insurance Exchange oh
 
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.970 align:start position:0%
state-based Health Insurance Exchange oh
yeah

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.930 align:start position:0%
yeah
now

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:38.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
so uh you want to remind this is that
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
we're we are we had chosen to be part of
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
the federal exchange and uh there's a
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
company that wants to come in and says
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to save us money maybe
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
on on switching to a steady big exchange
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
because we know where we will do a
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
bang-up job with this software and
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
and what we won't have glitches that
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
everyone was afraid of if we had a
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
state-based system
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Peter Bragdon
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
representing uh getting short uh briefly
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah allowed the state to set
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
up a state-based exchange for the
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act uh the state uh
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
chose back when it was started to have a
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
federal exchange for various reasons
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
um partially due to the fact there was
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
no very few other options at the time uh
 
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
now an industry has evolved where there
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
are private companies that offer
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
basically Exchange in a box that have
 
00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
proven they can save some money so this
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
Bill said okay the department will
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
investigate it and if they want to go
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
ahead and do it this committee had some
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
concerns which I think are legitimate
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
concerns that uh needed more information
 
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
about the program and a little concerned
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
about having the department just decide
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
to do something uh with some other
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
approval as well so what I think when we
 
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
last met uh with the committee uh you
 
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:00.059 align:start position:0%
folks had thought maybe the best thing
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
to do for this is have a study committee
 
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:03.020 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
and talk about between now and the bill
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
filing period what that study committee
 
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
should look at so that the committee
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
down the road then make an informed
 
00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:15.130 align:start position:0%
down the road then make an informed
decision

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:15.140 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
about whether this might work or not and
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
have some data behind it so
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
um I would uh my inkling was from that
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
that the committee would probably say
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
okay this bill is not recommended for
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
further legislation however a study of
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
the issue would be warranted
 
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.130 align:start position:0%
the issue would be warranted
right

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
they study Commission
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee commission whichever oh yeah
 
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.970 align:start position:0%
committee commission whichever oh yeah
right

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:39.980 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
oh yeah do you want to join a commission
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
or you want a study committee let me
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
talk to you about the difference between
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
but in this case it wasn't even it was
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
it was we were delegating the authority
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
to the to the department and never
 
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
actually having them to come back to us
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
and getting the blessing that the
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
department could just unilaterally go
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
ahead and implement it uh if they
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
thought that they could pull that off
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
right right and there was some
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
discussion too about uh where has this
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
succeeded in other states what has
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
happened how much does it cost uh all
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
those things all worthy of a study I
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
think yeah in my memories it was nothing
 
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
nothing was really out of the box they
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
still had to make change you would still
 
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
have to adapt the software for New
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah things would be
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
customized I do know that since we met
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
the state of Virginia has switched
 
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.330 align:start position:0%
the state of Virginia has switched
customers

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay representative Abrams uh more of a
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
comment than a question but you're
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%

um summarizing the Republican platform

uh giving consumers more choice and
 
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
options in order to get costs down but a
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
big part of that and what I've heard
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
from a lot of my constituents is they
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
want to be able to choose their own
 
00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
doctor they want to choose their own
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
plan because of quality and because of
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the quality of care and the the type
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
of service that they get
 
00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:09.769 align:start position:0%
of service that they get
um

00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
um when I look at these bills
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
um that's actually first and foremost in
 
00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
my mind I do think about the cost of
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
care I think we do think about the cost
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
of insurance but the the number one
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm looking at is trying to
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
improve the quality because that's what
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing about more for my
 
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.889 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing about more for my
constituents

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
yeah so the uh every Insurance product
 
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
sold in the State uh has a surcharge on
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
it that pays the federal government to
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
run the federal health exchange and so
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
the argument is that those states that
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
have switched to a state-based exchange
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
using some of the private companies that
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
compete in this market are able to save
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
money and thus reduce the tax that
 
00:30:50.289 --> 00:30:50.299 align:start position:0%
consumers have to pay
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
but let's answer his question that in
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
this exchange there is no networks
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
limiting who your provider can be uh
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
right this is just a different way to
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
implement the Affordable Care Act
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
um and so should you not care for the
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act that's a whole
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
different story uh and if you like the
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act it's a different
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
story we're required to have it under
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
federal law so but it's not like he was
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
worried about choosing his own doctors
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
and all right right this really is not
 
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
that you're sure just a suggestion for
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
the study commission duties is uh
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
consider patient privacy I think there's
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
a big push in HHS to make sure that
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
whatever system we put in place doesn't
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
leak data uh and that privacy is
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
maintained yeah that would be very
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
important and if there are folks here
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
that would like to be a part of that
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
study or help shape what that bill looks
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
it looks like I had my name on that bill
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
I believe there were some very highly
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
esteemed legislators as coasters I don't
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
remember that we were just giving to the
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
department and and washing our hands of
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
it but that's probably something small
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
that must have happened on the Senate
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
side okay
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that if there is a
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
commission the Democratic plan the
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
Democrats platform is to work on a
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis for the record thank
 
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.130 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis for the record thank
you

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
and it looks like Senator Roswell was
 
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor of the bill
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
that yes she so who she'll make the
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
motion that not recommend for future
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
legislation but that you know this you
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
know that we realize that this
 
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
legislation will probably come in again
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
and that uh it should become in a
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
how far but how far
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
half hour ahead
 
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.210 align:start position:0%
half hour ahead
um

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
so we get
 
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.509 align:start position:0%
so we get
pandas

00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:15.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
okay why don't we take a a brief yeah we
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
got a brief break for for panda
 
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:53.230 align:start position:0%

of course I'm I'm Benjamin buttons I'm

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
I just remind me this is this is
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
platinum now I was I was a I was uh you
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
know Platinum blunt when I was a kid you
 
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
know right toe head so this is it
 
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.589 align:start position:0%
know right toe head so this is it
it's

00:58:32.589 --> 00:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
all right so we're close enough we'll
 
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
take up uh 1501
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
a relative insurance coverage for
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
Pediatric autoimmune
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
today that's that was a mistake nobody
 
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
wishes to address it
 
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
I I didn't I didn't I
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
she couldn't read my scribble
 
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
it was my fault all right good morning
 
00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.410 align:start position:0%
it was my fault all right good morning
again

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
and introduce yourself and
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm Michelle Heaton I'm the health law
 
00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:39.059 align:start position:0%
and policy legal counsel at the
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
and so the last we left it was the uh
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
Department uh struggling because we're
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
the DSM still does not have recognized
 
00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
pins and this is still no code
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a typical disease to track and
 
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
diagnose so without clear diagnoses
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're unable it's not something that can
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
be coded for with building billing so
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're unable to really track it very
 
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.490 align:start position:0%
we're unable to really track it very
well

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:12.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
under this provision the mental health
 
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.549 align:start position:0%
under this provision the mental health
law

01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
mental health is an ehb essential health
 
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
benefit so under ACA it does need to be
 
01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
benefit so under ACA it does need to be
covered

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
covered
 
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.410 align:start position:0%
covered
um

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
so we don't think this provision is
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
really necessary
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
we understand why we would want to be
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
looking at this but from an insurance
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
perspective we don't think it's
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
necessary to have the Mandate in there
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
because it would be covered anyways and
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
it's the type of condition that is
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
not as definite as we would like okay
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
so and and as far as you know there have
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
no complaints or anything coming in
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
about no it's not something that we get
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
complaints about in the department okay
 
01:00:58.849 --> 01:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much sounds like not
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation and
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:13.069 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.910 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.710 align:start position:0%
um
chiropractors

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
because I would think there will be a
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
chiropractor or two who want to show up
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
for that one
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know yeah ouch
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.289 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:08.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
they want to be treated like primary
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
um we did have testimony from
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
chiropractors that are affected
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
um but Tyler Brennan was here too and
 
01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.289 align:start position:0%
said that
um

01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
right now the chiropractors are sort of
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
treated like
 
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
um it's a specialty well it's a special
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
day but
 
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
the insurance usually covers a certain
 
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
number of visits well that makes it
 
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
unusual that's from that was my issue my
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
issue was always that we had
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
carved out a special mandate for
 
01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:49.700 align:start position:0%
chiropractory and that is if a carrier
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
is going to offer
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic benefits in other words
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's not mandated to have chiropractor
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
but if they were going to the Mandate
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
was that you can at least do 12 Billings
 
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
a year you can have monthly billing
 
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.910 align:start position:0%
a year you can have monthly billing
and

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
um and and which of course
 
01:03:13.609 --> 01:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
but the co-pays really Mount up right
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
but at that time I I was adamantly
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to that legislation and because
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
I thought it was an unfunded mandate and
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
um and I kept saying but by the way guys
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh I won't be surprised if some
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
insurance company drops chiropractor
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
coverage and sure enough did not Signet
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
drop it which in the in the room George
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
is not in the room but but they actually
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
did drop the coverage now since then
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
they've now picked it up but they when
 
01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:45.740 align:start position:0%
they picked it up the copay is is
 
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
yeah it's brutal it's not it's not very
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
good there are some we also heard
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
testimony that some are as low as ten
 
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.670 align:start position:0%
testimony that some are as low as ten
dollars

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.690 align:start position:0%
dollars
right

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
no it's basically now it's just
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
basically a
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
sign-in fee and and you know and the
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
person has to pay out of pocket I mean
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
the co-pays have changed so much over
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years used to be two visits
 
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
a year you know you had to pay well the
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
two visits these days are up to what a
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
visit to the
 
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
for just your regular physicals 175 or
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
something like that and if we had to pay
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
that twice a year everybody be up in
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
arms right so when I served on the board
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
of Healthy Kids one of the things we
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
were acutely aware of is
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
um it is the co it's the importance of
 
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
the copay deductible and the impact on
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
getting someone to
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
get something taken care of right and
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
that you never want to you you want you
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
want cost sharing so you want to have
 
01:04:44.329 --> 01:04:44.339 align:start position:0%
some skin in the game to go to the
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
doctor but you don't want it to be too
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
high that they say I'm not going to do
 
01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:51.260 align:start position:0%
it right because it's too much
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
and um so you know that's uh right now
 
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.710 align:start position:0%
and um so you know that's uh right now
you

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of you're going to your
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
primary care physician is there some
 
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
case you you don't have you have no
 
01:05:07.809 --> 01:05:07.819 align:start position:0%
copay right okay right
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
again saying to you you know don't try
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
to get that specialist don't try to just
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
come on in come on in and and we'll take
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
care of you know and get an address or
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
at least find out get into the system
 
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.030 align:start position:0%
at least find out get into the system
um

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
with state employees have Aetna and
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
they're calling you constantly for a
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
home visit well I just had my physical
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
last week or something and they still
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
want me to have a home visit I don't
 
01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
want a home visit well yeah that home
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
visit that actually is is Medicare well
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
it's a that's a Medicare mandate but the
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
state and it's so unbelievable when
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
Harvard called me and said and begged me
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
to have a talk have someone come to my
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
house I'm not doing it no no it is
 
01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
ridiculous but at any rate
 
01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.069 align:start position:0%
ridiculous but at any rate
um

01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
but I mean the problem with this the
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
advantage part of the advantage you know
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
because when I said you know when I was
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
before but now that I'm on advantage and
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
they they're calling up and say yeah we
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
want to come in and and you know take
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
your blood pressure I'm not gonna do it
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
now they've got even 100 Amazon gift
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
card this week right and I said no oh
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly they wanted to give you a
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
75 gift card to come come visit you at
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
your home and then and then this is this
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
is Advantage if you're in Medicare
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
Advantage which assume you might know
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
the difference of regular Medicare right
 
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.970 align:start position:0%
the difference of regular Medicare right
so

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:27.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
then I then they started having someone
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
she was calling me every month
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I finally I said both of you and I
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
finally like you know because I didn't
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
get really the result because I again I
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
had a problem with my toes and turns out
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
like you know that's why I need special
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
inserts and a lot of us have Orthotics
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and I finally says you know are
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
you guys built I know I pulled out my
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
Harvard monthly statement and saw that
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
they were getting billed for that phone
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
call and I called immediately called
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
back and I said you turned this thing
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
off right now I've asked him a few times
 
01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
to stop calling us and they keep calling
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
yeah really I didn't know that yes you
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
have to call you have to tell them okay
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
you don't talk to the person who's
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
calling you no because they're just
 
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
doing their job you got to call you know
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
the actual I'll talk to administrative
 
01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.270 align:start position:0%
the actual I'll talk to administrative
services

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
their bill yeah would you get your you
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
get monthly I mean I don't know who you
 
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
have Advantage I have Harvard we have
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
we're state employees right so you don't
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah manage but
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so they don't send you a monthly
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
statement of your oh yeah they emailed
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
it finally but nobody you know they send
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
you all these pages and they got foreign
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
language page and they've got cover
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
pages and you have to kind of weave
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
through it to one page and they're in
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
the middle of the page whereas you know
 
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
that yeah they were billing
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
15 Ballers or something yeah
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
no it's not mental health but anyway um
 
01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:54.059 align:start position:0%
to go back to this bill
 
01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:55.460 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic has certainly an important
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
place in health care yeah I agree but
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
taking it you know
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
to reduce the charge for no let's say
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
those charge for primary care physician
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
or osteopath
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
um should not be greater than
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
12 visits a year
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
well that was what I said I don't know
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
if you remember I said if you're willing
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
to repeal the 12 yeah that's because I
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
didn't like that in the first place if
 
01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:24.299 align:start position:0%
you're willing to repeal that then I'm
 
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
willing to you know let people get that
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
coverage because for me every time I you
 
01:08:30.289 --> 01:08:30.299 align:start position:0%
know I've done something where I pick
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
you know bad you know got my back
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
twisted and I I don't call any other
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
doctor I just go right to my
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
chiropractor and get the twist right and
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
and sometimes say yes don't you want to
 
01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
come back tomorrow or come back you know
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
no no all I need is one twist and that
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
and that really is there's always been
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know knock on wood that's always
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
worked for me yeah um so yeah you know
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
if it's just that kind of service which
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
is almost emergency room if you call
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
that you know to me until coming in and
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
then so if they're willing to let go of
 
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
that 12 12 12 visits a year mandate uh I
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
would be willing to consider this bill
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
but Tyler Brennan also told us according
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
to my notes here that you can expect
 
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
premiums to go up to be affected there's
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
no doubt by um reducing the co-pays and
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
I want have a tough time with that
 
01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.010 align:start position:0%
I want have a tough time with that
I

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.739 --> 01:09:36.169 align:start position:0%
 
ER

01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
they would have to make the referral
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
right right but you're supposed to
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to go to your primary
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
first or at least talk to the their
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
their nurse ahead of time and she'll you
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
know kind of cover you know
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
the triage you and sometimes they'll
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
refer you and sometimes they'll say no
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
and most of the times they'll tell you
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
you got to come in most most of the time
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
these days you got to come in and they
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
and then and then they'll evaluate it
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
and then and of course they're they're
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
trained to send you to you know they're
 
01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
a surgeon they're well but they're
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
they're not gonna they don't want you to
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
send you to fit they won't no no they're
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
going to send you the surgeon this
 
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
surgeon is the one who's gonna refer to
 
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
physical therapy they own the physical
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
therapy please well that was that was
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
that was we've had that legislation that
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
goes way back I mean I remember when
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
George Roberts was the the lobbyist on
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
that one but yeah
 
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.010 align:start position:0%
that one but yeah
yes

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
so I sort of
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
refreshing my memory but I know a lot of
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies or at least the
 
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
one I know I have they have taken off
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
the limits of the number of Chiropractic
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
visits you can go as many times as you
 
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.709 align:start position:0%
visits you can go as many times as you
want

01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:44.330 align:start position:0%
want
um

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
and it's it's worked great and I think a
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
lot of them because the demand is there
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
and they can see the benefits from it
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
right that it's saving them money that I
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
think that you know I really don't think
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed and I think that
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
because the patients are asking for it
 
01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:10.250 align:start position:0%
because the patients are asking for it
it

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
but this bill would be to reduce the
 
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.510 align:start position:0%
but this bill would be to reduce the
co-pays

01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
co-pays
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
for as many visits as you have
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
right that's what this bill's about
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so she's saying that we don't
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
need this bill because because they
 
01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
they're they're actually increased to
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
12. there you can get as many as you
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
want but yeah it's you've got your skin
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
in the game you're going to make that
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
copay knowing full well that you want
 
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
all those visits
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
but you are going to pay co-pays for
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
each of them right and it's still
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
considered a specialty so I don't think
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
we need I mean in my opinion I don't
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
think but we should recommend this for
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
so is there anybody in the audience who
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
wants to lay in on this I I know the
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
sponsor so I wouldn't be surprised he's
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
going to show up but
 
01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.050 align:start position:0%
going to show up but
um

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman this bill refresh my
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
memories just to reduce the co-payments
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
correct well basically is to match
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
whatever your policy has for Primary
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
Care primary care physician so basically
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
this is this is a request to increase
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
overall premiums it will absolutely
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
increase premiums right and this issue
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
this this bill did not deal with whether
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
you needed to be referred by a primary
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with any of that
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
refers that that is an issue
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
a primary care physician won't refer you
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
to a country right as you as you
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned because one serious issue is
 
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
that there are people who find that it's
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
a healthful practice
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
for them to see a chiropractor but they
 
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
can't continue to go and receive
 
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
coverage unless it they can document an
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
injury right so unless you're injured
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't receive an insurance
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
benefit that's another issue that's not
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
covered in this bill okay we'll take
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
that up some other year maybe okay thank
 
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.750 align:start position:0%
that up some other year maybe okay thank
you

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
oh yeah representative petusic
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman uh I go
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
to a chiropractor every month you know
 
01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:17.300 align:start position:0%
12 visits and I know their fee schedule
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
because I am on Medicare and I have
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
United Healthcare as my secondary their
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
fee schedule is different for me than it
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
is for a walk-in that this is not on
 
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.270 align:start position:0%
is for a walk-in that this is not on
Medicare

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
so they do have different fee schedules
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
depending on probably their insurer and
 
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
some do have more lenient and summer
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
very tight so I just thought I'd share
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman I directed
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
question to representative yeah
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%

yes do you have to document an injury
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
so with your insurance you get 12 for no
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
reason whatsoever other than your own
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
like clockwork
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
they might want to look you might want
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
to teach yourself
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
so I and I would let's just say just a
 
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
second is that if I'm I would say is
 
01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
that this legislation would only affect
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's no small group Market it would not
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
affect Medicare so that all of us in the
 
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
room would not be affected by this
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
Legacy anyway
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
he said Max Max
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
um so it's just a comment but I'm I I
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
kind of feel at this point that I'm
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
leaning against it my reason is that I
 
01:14:48.169 --> 01:14:48.179 align:start position:0%
view Insurance like
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
car insurance Life Insurance homeowners
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
insurance it's it's just something to
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
deal with the you know occasional
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
unexpected big out of control costs that
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:14:59.209 --> 01:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
sorry about that I'm doing it myself
 
01:14:59.219 --> 01:15:00.290 align:start position:0%
sorry about that I'm doing it myself
again

01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
it it it's not efficient to pay an
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
insurance company as a third party to
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
pay for a routine expected visits I do
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
I've used chiropractors many many times
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
and I've always paid cash it's it's
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
unless my insurance covered it
 
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
um but insurance is cheaper if it's only
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
covering you know something five
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
thousand ten thousand dollar or thirty
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars something that's a big
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
unexpected cost I know that there are a
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
lot of people who want to have an
 
01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
insurance plan where they just show
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
their card like back in the 50s and 60s
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
and you just showed your card and
 
01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
somebody else took care of it but that's
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
had the tendency to encourage costs to
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
go up and up and up it doesn't have the
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment and you know it's like
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's like the Free bottle of Tylenol
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
people would just kind of go into the
 
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
office and grab the Free bottle of
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
Tylenol as soon as they put a one dollar
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
copay on it people don't grab as much
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't expect to pay for routine
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
expenses like an oil change through my
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
car insurance I wouldn't expect to pay
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
for replacing a roof or Landscaping
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative pilot so I I um
 
01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative just wanted to tell you
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
in the 50s and 60s we did pay for the
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
first two office visits each year
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
yeah just to let you know right and the
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
office visits of course have gone up
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
tremendously and co-pays came in and
 
01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing but but you're
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
absolutely right the insurance was there
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the sudden unexpected and you um
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
planned for the lower costs
 
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
I might yeah so they back in the 30s and
 
01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
40s and 50s
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
um they used to sell life insurance
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
plans correct that would just have a
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance plan attached to it as
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
a little free vending but it was always
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
80 20. yeah it was 80 20. it was the
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
insurance company would cover the 80 you
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
always had to pay 20 but it was health
 
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
insurance was five percent of GDP just
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
like it is in Hong Kong or Singapore
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
today it was it was there was very
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
little government involvement there were
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
very few of these Insurance mandates
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
like this bill so we had you know you
 
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
had a much more affordable system so
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
therefore in some parts of the country
 
01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
didn't even yeah I mean absolutely I
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
remember in the 70s when that but I was
 
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
in college and had to be educated on on
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
this and um most employers is the
 
01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.370 align:start position:0%
this and um most employers is the
employers

01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
insurance it was a life a ten thousand
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
dollar life insurance policy that also
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
happened to have
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
the health insurance benefit 80 20. and
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
and when people ask me well what changed
 
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
between now and then I would say number
 
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
one is Pharmaceutical
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
number one drugs you know back then we
 
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
didn't have all these wonderful new
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
invented drugs you know we had aspirin
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you know so now we had the
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
A and B is the Specialties that that we
 
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
didn't have all those doctors who were
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
special Specialties that got referred to
 
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why health
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums have gone through the
 
01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.790 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums have gone through the
roof

01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
roof
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
we could blame hospitals because Paul
 
01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:04.790 align:start position:0%
we could blame hospitals because Paul
left

01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative well I just wonder
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
how is this going to impact people like
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
with chronic back pain you know that's
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
not an emergency and for a lot of people
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
they do get relief
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and you know to me it's like a
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
toothache you know you have a really bad
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
toothache you really can't function and
 
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:24.260 align:start position:0%
back back pain is is can also really
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
deter you from doing the things you do
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
in your life particularly if you have an
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
active job so you know how is that going
 
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
to impact those folks
 
01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
well right now how is it impacting
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
because right now the current law is
 
01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
that you know that that the copay is uh
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
is relatively high as compared to what
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
you would pay for your primary yeah so
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
you know so saying that might help I
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
mean you know again nobody goes to the
 
01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
that's the point that was the point of
 
01:18:59.570 --> 01:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
this bill is that that the difference is
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
it's a different kind of service
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
so if it if it was anything it should be
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
well what's the copay for your physical
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
therapist if you're going to see them
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
every month
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh not primary care that was the problem
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
with this bill is this bill was
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay we're getting close to see if
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
somebody shows up but uh who who would
 
01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:25.420 align:start position:0%
be the one willing to carry this forward
 
01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.669 align:start position:0%
be the one willing to carry this forward
[Music]

01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
and it's lunchtime
 
01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:42.110 align:start position:0%
and it's lunchtime
okay

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's just we'll wait till 11 30
 
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
and see if anybody shows up and
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
oh uh Mr chair yes um I did have a a
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
question on the panda bill
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
um okay so I guess it's kind of a
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
lingering question but what the estimate
 
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
of I think I asked it during the
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
previous executive session with the
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
estimate of the increase cost would be
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
just passed it so right now um the
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
problem with pandas is we we actually
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
don't know if it exists what's the
 
01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
extent or what's going on out there
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
it's a very unusual circumstance and and
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things I learned on this
 
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:33.470 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things I learned on this
committee

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
um years ago is about the DSM are you
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
um what was that what is the DSM someone
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
yeah diagnostic
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh but it's for mental health to mental
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
health and I think we're up to like nine
 
01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
now when I first got on this committee
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
we were at four so they have improved
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
and and just to show you how
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
controversial it potentially was that
 
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
way back in four
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
um I think they actually uh said uh
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
being gay was actually a mental health
 
01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.090 align:start position:0%
being gay was actually a mental health
condition

01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
so it has gone through its own
 
01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
progressions over the years
 
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what is in the DSM but
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
the DSM is the Bible of diagnosing
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
um mental illness and pandas is not in
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
in there it doesn't it has not been
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
picked up
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
so in our in our cases what what we
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
learned with the insurance companies the
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
department was that
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
um it is covered but it's covered under
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
a different diagnosis
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so therefore is to really identify
 
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
pandas and making sure it's being
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
covered as a panda is we it's hard to
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
mandate something that doesn't hasn't
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's not in the DSM
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
but having said that that we we never
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
heard that the people weren't getting
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
coverage well the original testimony was
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
a guy who had a daughter
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
it was even more than that it was back
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
when Macbeth or sonic actually she was
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
on the committee she was she was a
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
member of the committee when way back
 
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:17.810 align:start position:0%
member of the committee when way back
yeah

01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:26.810 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:47.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:08.450 align:start position:0%
 
really

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:16.130 align:start position:0%
 
expressions

01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
like yeah I remember that
 
01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.090 align:start position:0%
like yeah I remember that
right

01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
um and when we when we got you know
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
really into the Weeds on it
 
01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
we came up with a bill that said you
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
know they've they need the we had the
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
department told the department to pay
 
01:23:33.239 --> 01:23:34.209 align:start position:0%
department told the department to pay
attention

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:34.219 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
see what was going on right and then two
 
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
years later you know Tyler came back and
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
said well we can't really code it we
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
don't really know but there had not been
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
work but he did have some other code
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
that he thought was the one that was
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
being used so I remember I don't think
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
it was very specific though no it wasn't
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
specific but it wasn't specific the
 
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
pandas for sure but he said he said this
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
is the one the closest one that they
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
think is is being used if it's being
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
used you know out there but I think I
 
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
mean the bottom line is we have not
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
heard the insurance department has not
 
01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
heard more complaints and we have not
 
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
had more constituents coming in and
 
01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
saying their child needs the coverage
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
and right they're not getting coverage
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.030 align:start position:0%
right um
so

01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
okay I agree represent Grayson thank you
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
quicker what uh what type of doctor or
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
what specialist uh would treat
 
01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
a patient with pandas
 
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
I was doing a psychiatrist but I don't
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
hi Paula Rogers this was had a long
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
history and it was a fraught with a lot
 
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
of sort of emotional testimony and
 
01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
basically the mandate
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
was put into place the issue was not so
 
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
much that a child with this the the
 
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.610 align:start position:0%
much that a child with this the the
um

01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
child diagnosed as having possibly
 
01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:09.380 align:start position:0%
having pandas which is associated with
 
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:12.500 align:start position:0%
neurological developments that occur
 
01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:15.380 align:start position:0%
subsequent to or along with a
 
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
streptococcal infection
 
01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:19.580 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
testimony and a lot of Confusion And if
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
you go online and I did that last night
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
because it sort of interested me what is
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
the recent
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
what's the recent take on pandas because
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
the there were a number of states that
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
immediately passed mandates but there
 
01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:35.219 align:start position:0%
were not that many
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
the issue was child presents with
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
symptoms it probably goes to a
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
pediatrician in the first instance the
 
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
Pediatric folks had taken a position
 
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
that certain medications were probably
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
not appropriate for treatment if this
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
diagnosis was presented and the most
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
controversial were to something called
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
aphoresis and another which was IVIG
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
which is immunoglobulin both infusions
 
01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:04.100 align:start position:0%
very expensive with lots of side effects
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of concern among the Pediatric
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
population of Physicians
 
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
what should we do here and so it went
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
back and forth and the issues seemed to
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
really come right down to the IVIG which
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
is an immunoglobulin infusion which is
 
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
given to apparently kids who have
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
serious indications of pandas
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
and many of the carries were concerned
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
about this I think we gently objected to
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
it it was put on the books and the issue
 
01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
was thought to be well let's see what
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
happens so for three years four years
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's been on the books I don't think
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
Anthem and Sabrina Dunlop is here and
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
she would be more current of that has
 
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:50.219 align:start position:0%
had any complaints about that
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
so IVIG has been provided I would
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
suspect that a lot of Physicians aren't
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
prescribing it because it was kind of
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
iffy as a treatment so that's kind of
 
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
where we are with this nobody is
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
debating that there isn't this syndrome
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
but the treatment around it is clearly
 
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
very problematic and when I looked at
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
recent issues last night as best as I
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
could by Googling about it doesn't seem
 
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
that there's anything more definitive
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
but I mean psychiatric component but
 
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
we're talking hundreds of thousands of
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
dollars per year for treatment yes I
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
think an infusion could be as much as
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollars right and they
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
would a child might have five or six of
 
01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
those infusions and this is a chronic
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
condition this is this is something that
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
we had testimony that one had occurred
 
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
at seven years old but one had been
 
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
going on at like 14 and had gone into
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
this his 20s he'd been in and out of
 
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
jail because it's a behavioral
 
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
the symptomatic the symptoms are
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
behavioral which cause real
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
social problems and a real question as
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
to the is this really Associated right
 
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
really I mean it's a really hard
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
condition and it's rare so there have
 
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
been no compliance so I'm not so sure
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
why you would want to keep the
 
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
thing going and what the traditional
 
01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
thing would be you know
 
01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:11.219 align:start position:0%
um probably
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
some sort of steroid
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
for any inflammation antibiotics maybe
 
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy for the child but we heard
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
about terribly terribly severe cases
 
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
really did
 
01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:24.229 align:start position:0%
really did
um

01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
so it was it was very emotional but
 
01:28:30.169 --> 01:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
right now we still it's still
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Mandate is that it would still be on
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
the books until uh July 1st of 2024 I
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
believe so there'd still be more time if
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
more evidence came out and and really as
 
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
a committee none of us are doctors we
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
we don't know even with a testimony of
 
01:28:52.689 --> 01:28:52.699 align:start position:0%
doctors and insurance carriers and
 
01:28:55.729 --> 01:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
attorneys we don't know if this
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
treatment is actually effective
 
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
but your heart goes out to the families
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
that have had to deal with this there's
 
01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
you know and like you were saying some
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
of it is and even anecdotal because
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
they're still trying to figure out
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
what the cause is put the committee in
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
an odd position of trying to come up
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
with a clinical
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
basis for passing a statutory provision
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure chairman remembers the one
 
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
with uh breast cancer and
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
and you know what forgotten exactly what
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
it was well it was meant it was meant a
 
01:29:30.659 --> 01:29:32.050 align:start position:0%
it was well it was meant it was meant a
um

01:29:32.050 --> 01:29:32.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
bone marrow transplants for her but it
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
was it was for solid cancers it was no
 
01:29:37.679 --> 01:29:39.169 align:start position:0%
was it was for solid cancers it was no
situation

01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
yeah and that was on the books and we
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
finally got that off the books and that
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
was a struggle it took many years to get
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
it get it off and I don't think it was
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
utilized it was in conjunction with
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
researcher at Dartmouth that was it was
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon they were doing it so it puts
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
the it puts you in an artist position
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
it's hard to not want to do something
 
01:30:01.450 --> 01:30:01.460 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Ammon
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett made my point
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
that if we do nothing we still have all
 
01:30:07.209 --> 01:30:07.219 align:start position:0%
next term to uh deal with the
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
termination date of July 1st 2024. but
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
the study the monitoring of it by the
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department and they're
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to annual give us an annual
 
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
reporters on on
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
what they learn of what's Happening
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's what the original
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
Bill had required
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
um and this bill was just too I I think
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
it was true just to force out the the
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
four it pushed the effective date yeah
 
01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
Sunset yeah to repeal the sunsets right
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
right right so
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh Last Chance anybody want to talk
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative Emerson oh I just
 
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a point on both on this
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill and the other bill
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I think four or five years ago I put
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
in a bill on health savings accounts and
 
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
one of the I think is for HHS one of the
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
arguments that I made or the case that I
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
made for
 
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:03.860 align:start position:0%
um that qualifying High deductible plan
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
was uh that with health savings accounts
 
01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
money builds up over time and you're
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
always going to have something that that
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
isn't covered or something that's a
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
brand new type of treatment or
 
01:31:15.649 --> 01:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
experimental treatment of some kind and
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
health savings accounts you can you can
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
pay for things because you have over
 
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
time you build up a couple hundred
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in that per person and
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
you can cover things that are unusual or
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
unexpected that the insurance might not
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
cover and it gives you a lot more
 
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
flexibility you can take that card
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the world if you want
 
01:40:45.649 --> 01:40:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.659 --> 01:45:17.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.219 --> 02:13:38.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:18.170 --> 03:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:26.450 --> 03:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.290 --> 03:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.300 --> 03:16:42.769 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:16:42.769 --> 03:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:48.190 --> 03:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.640 --> 03:16:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
actually

03:16:56.510 --> 03:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:16:59.510 --> 03:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know you know I don't ever regret
 
03:17:03.110 --> 03:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:08.690 --> 03:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
no life you have life yeah but okay
 
03:17:11.330 --> 03:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
HP 488 establishing committee to study
 
03:17:12.650 --> 03:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
the benefits of allowing New Hampshire
 
03:17:14.330 --> 03:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
citizens to purchase health insurance
 
03:17:17.330 --> 03:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
from out of state companies
 
03:17:17.340 --> 03:17:19.929 align:start position:0%
from out of state companies
and

03:17:19.929 --> 03:17:19.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:17:26.590 --> 03:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:30.769 --> 03:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't okay so as I I'll say what
 
03:17:32.929 --> 03:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
I've said a million times if there was
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
some out-of-state insurance company that
 
03:17:36.349 --> 03:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
wants to sell health insurance New
 
03:17:38.330 --> 03:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens I'd be the first one
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
to sponsor that bill but I need to I
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
need to have that company
 
03:17:44.990 --> 03:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
come to me and say they want to do it
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'll uh make the motion that let's not
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
be recommended for okay uh future
 
03:17:50.220 --> 03:17:59.469 align:start position:0%
be recommended for okay uh future
legislation

03:17:59.469 --> 03:17:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.030 --> 03:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know through Medicare or
 
03:18:04.429 --> 03:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
supplemental is uh Martin's Point and
 
03:18:05.990 --> 03:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're out of me oh there are yeah
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
they're yes and I that's right is that
 
03:18:11.450 --> 03:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
different because it's yes so this is
 
03:18:15.290 --> 03:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
this is about uh the small group Market
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
so this would be employer based product
 
03:18:22.429 --> 03:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
or in in the individual Market but
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
um what happens is companies license
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
themselves in the state because the
 
03:18:30.650 --> 03:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
state is the regulator
 
03:18:32.570 --> 03:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
of the policy okay so there's no
 
03:18:34.809 --> 03:18:34.819 align:start position:0%
regulation if it's out of state so
 
03:18:37.550 --> 03:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
and if you if you wanted the long story
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to do it in 60 seconds in
 
03:18:45.290 --> 03:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
the old days prior to the Affordable
 
03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
Care Act
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
and let's say even prior to when we had
 
03:18:52.670 --> 03:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
7-Eleven which Paul and I are the only
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
ones in the room were around for that
 
03:18:57.349 --> 03:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
nightmare but uh so when we passed you
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
know Gene chaheen's you know the act the
 
03:19:03.769 --> 03:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
issue was that uh insurance companies
 
03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
would medically underwrite all the
 
03:19:06.420 --> 03:19:08.150 align:start position:0%
would medically underwrite all the
employees

03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:19:10.490 --> 03:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
and um sure enough one of the reasons
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
why I actually voted for it so
 
03:19:14.510 --> 03:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
much of this your grin I guess but
 
03:19:16.849 --> 03:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
probably is that I I voted for the
 
03:19:19.250 --> 03:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act long before anybody
 
03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
called it that because my company which
 
03:19:25.010 --> 03:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
I had to come you know 20 employees we
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
were Matthew Thornton which is a
 
03:19:28.849 --> 03:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
non-profit you know eventually get
 
03:19:32.570 --> 03:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
absorbed by Anthony that they uh two
 
03:19:34.849 --> 03:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
months after we had a renewal we got we
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
got dropped
 
03:19:39.050 --> 03:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
and uh what do you mean you can't drop
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
us we just signed the paper you know
 
03:19:42.230 --> 03:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're all outside of it I don't know we
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
have we have the right you don't see
 
03:19:45.050 --> 03:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
down somewhere in the fine print that we
 
03:19:46.849 --> 03:19:46.859 align:start position:0%
have the right to drop you and and the
 
03:19:48.530 --> 03:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
reason they dropped us was because we
 
03:19:51.650 --> 03:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
had an employee whose son
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh got hurt on a three-wheeler remember
 
03:19:56.210 --> 03:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
the three wheelers the front wheel in
 
03:19:59.150 --> 03:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
the front and the two and and and he got
 
03:20:02.330 --> 03:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
really mangled and so one of the guys
 
03:20:04.010 --> 03:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
with the bean counters the medical
 
03:20:06.590 --> 03:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
Underwriters said he decided our group
 
03:20:09.469 --> 03:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
which was we were selling in computers
 
03:20:12.290 --> 03:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
so we were generally young people and so
 
03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
they decided that they just they didn't
 
03:20:17.330 --> 03:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
want us to be on their plan anymore so
 
03:20:18.230 --> 03:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
they just
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
drop this so medical underwriting was
 
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
clearly a big issue and so when you look
 
03:20:27.769 --> 03:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
at as we move the clock forward going
 
03:20:30.769 --> 03:20:30.779 align:start position:0%
forward what what happens is that
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes New Hampshire did pass 7-Eleven and
 
03:20:35.929 --> 03:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
we did narrow how many insurance
 
03:20:37.490 --> 03:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
companies were selling health insurance
 
03:20:41.809 --> 03:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
in the state and uh and you say well my
 
03:20:43.969 --> 03:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
cousin you know I talked to him he's
 
03:20:46.010 --> 03:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
down in Arizona and there his insurance
 
03:20:49.550 --> 03:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
is half my premium well why well because
 
03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
other states had medical underwriting
 
03:20:55.010 --> 03:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
and so therefore if you had a good
 
03:20:57.610 --> 03:20:57.620 align:start position:0%
healthy group you got cheap insurance
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
whereas New Hampshire we were obviously
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know under the Affordable Care Act
 
03:21:05.450 --> 03:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
before it was for a care act so this
 
03:21:06.830 --> 03:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
concept of buying health insurance
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
across state lines really States back to
 
03:21:13.849 --> 03:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
the old days when States really did have
 
03:21:15.769 --> 03:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
variable rates and that you know that
 
03:21:18.050 --> 03:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
some states were clearly you know you'd
 
03:21:20.030 --> 03:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
be cheap Assurance but as the the
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
running rule the running joke was but
 
03:21:23.750 --> 03:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't ever make a claim
 
03:21:25.370 --> 03:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
because you start making a claim then
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
bam they'll send you that discontinued
 
03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:28.969 align:start position:0%
bam they'll send you that discontinued
nose

03:21:28.969 --> 03:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
nose
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so yes it would be I if some
 
03:21:34.429 --> 03:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
out-of-state company wants to come into
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and sell health insurance
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and say that you're now
 
03:21:42.889 --> 03:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
regulated by the laws of that state
 
03:21:46.610 --> 03:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
not this state right well you know guess
 
03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
what well
 
03:21:50.570 --> 03:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
another issue now now I'm going to spend
 
03:21:52.190 --> 03:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
another minute another issue we had not
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
dealt with much in this committee is the
 
03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act except that bill
 
03:22:00.650 --> 03:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
yesterday okay well as the defender of
 
03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act one of the
 
03:22:06.230 --> 03:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
big things was is the is that I was able
 
03:22:08.150 --> 03:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
to mandate the insurance commissioner
 
03:22:11.469 --> 03:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
have power restitution for the consumer
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
and in that there are the exemptions is
 
03:22:16.790 --> 03:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies are not under
 
03:22:19.250 --> 03:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act because
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're regulated by the insurance
 
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
department so if you're an out-of-state
 
03:22:26.030 --> 03:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
insurance company selling a product in
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
you would not get that exception
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
you would follow the fault you would end
 
03:22:35.090 --> 03:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
up under our consumer protection act
 
03:22:37.370 --> 03:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
which has the right of private action
 
03:22:40.670 --> 03:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
and triple damages so I can assure you
 
03:22:42.530 --> 03:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
and this is how Bill O'Brien when I
 
03:22:43.969 --> 03:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
explain this to Bill O'Brien in a
 
03:22:45.410 --> 03:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
heartbeat he knew exactly what I was
 
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
talking about and he said he said okay I
 
03:22:49.969 --> 03:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
get it no insurance company is going to
 
03:22:52.250 --> 03:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
want to come into this state and not be
 
03:22:53.929 --> 03:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
regulated by the insurance commissioner
 
03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
because then anybody could sue them for
 
03:22:58.370 --> 03:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
triple damages if they were not happy
 
03:23:00.349 --> 03:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
with the insurance product they were
 
03:23:04.010 --> 03:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
getting so this is a concept that is uh
 
03:23:06.170 --> 03:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
had some truth to it
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
it is never going to make you know never
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
no company's ever going to do it but I
 
03:23:13.010 --> 03:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
would always go on record and say
 
03:23:15.050 --> 03:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
if some insurance company comes to me
 
03:23:17.210 --> 03:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
and say yeah we want to sell it in New
 
03:23:18.290 --> 03:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Market
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh fine with me I'll write the
 
03:23:22.630 --> 03:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
legislation for you I'll make sure I'll
 
03:23:25.010 --> 03:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
streamline it all in but it ain't gonna
 
03:23:26.929 --> 03:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
ever happen
 
03:23:28.969 --> 03:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
represent back later just to take it a
 
03:23:30.830 --> 03:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
step further I don't think they can do
 
03:23:33.110 --> 03:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
that in other words I think the
 
03:23:35.690 --> 03:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
insurance statutes say in order for you
 
03:23:39.290 --> 03:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
to sell a policy in New Hampshire like
 
03:23:41.450 --> 03:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
any other state that insurance company
 
03:23:43.729 --> 03:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
has to be doesn't have to be domiciled
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but it has to be
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
licensed exact temperature and if you're
 
03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
not in lace in New Hampshire you simply
 
03:23:50.450 --> 03:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
can't sell I would have so if they
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
really wanted to to bypass that statute
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think they can I no that we we
 
03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
would I would be the first one to write
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
that bill to allow them to do that all
 
03:24:03.530 --> 03:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
right you know what I'm saying that I
 
03:24:06.590 --> 03:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah no I'm I'm I'm pro-choice I I if
 
03:24:08.690 --> 03:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
they want to come in and do that I I
 
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
would certainly enable them to do it but
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
I I have no illusions that any of them
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
will ever when I choose that and and
 
03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
like you say you get to the real heart
 
03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
of the issue is the domicile you know if
 
03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
they are domicile in their own state
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
so representative Abramson so I
 
03:24:29.809 --> 03:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
so this is uh two issues on the
 
03:24:32.389 --> 03:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
philosophical or legal legislative issue
 
03:24:34.010 --> 03:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
03:24:36.229 --> 03:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
do we change the law to allow it to
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
happen before someone comes in or do we
 
03:24:40.849 --> 03:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
wait until someone presumably with a
 
03:24:43.550 --> 03:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
paid lobbyist comes in and and asks to
 
03:24:45.050 --> 03:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
have the law be changed and I've always
 
03:24:45.060 --> 03:24:46.070 align:start position:0%
have the law be changed and I've always
said

03:24:46.070 --> 03:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:24:48.590 --> 03:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
make it legal first make it allowable
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
first and then someone will come in and
 
03:24:53.389 --> 03:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
come to the insurance department the
 
03:24:55.309 --> 03:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
second thing is the staying on the topic
 
03:24:58.429 --> 03:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
of the bill the bill is is only asking
 
03:25:00.889 --> 03:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
uh to establish a committee to study the
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
benefits and we had several years ago
 
03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
when a similar bill came in
 
03:25:08.690 --> 03:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to figure out under
 
03:25:11.809 --> 03:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
Governor Hassan we wanted to figure out
 
03:25:14.210 --> 03:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
what the actual potential savings would
 
03:25:16.130 --> 03:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
be and the insurance commissioner at
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
that time first said 10 savings and then
 
03:25:21.050 --> 03:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
he said five percent savings and he said
 
03:25:23.210 --> 03:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
possibly as low as three percent savings
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
on health insurance costs and I came
 
03:25:28.729 --> 03:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
back to some of the then members of this
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
committee and I said again just what I
 
03:25:32.450 --> 03:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
said before it isn't just the savings
 
03:25:33.769 --> 03:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
we're talking about all the benefits
 
03:25:36.410 --> 03:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
including improved Choice improved
 
03:25:38.870 --> 03:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
quality of care when you have the right
 
03:25:41.210 --> 03:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
to go somewhere else companies tend to
 
03:25:43.550 --> 03:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
want to compete for you not just on cost
 
03:25:45.229 --> 03:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
but on service on having better tech
 
03:25:48.370 --> 03:25:48.380 align:start position:0%
support having somebody available 24 7
 
03:25:50.809 --> 03:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
having out of network services and so on
 
03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that the consumer wants
 
03:25:55.250 --> 03:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
so I I think that just
 
03:25:57.410 --> 03:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
it um I'm not sure that the bill even
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily advocates for it but it was
 
03:26:01.729 --> 03:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
just the question was asking first and
 
03:26:02.990 --> 03:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
foremost before we try to make a
 
03:26:06.170 --> 03:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
decision on that what are the benefits
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
um is there a cost savings and even if
 
03:26:09.769 --> 03:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
the cost savings is minimal could there
 
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
be an improvement in quality of life or
 
03:26:14.210 --> 03:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
reduction in infant mortality rates or
 
03:26:16.070 --> 03:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
hospital infection rates or what have
 
03:26:18.050 --> 03:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
you we'd have to really do a deep dive
 
03:26:20.450 --> 03:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
in that and that would require a group
 
03:26:22.990 --> 03:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
to look into that
 
03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
03:26:29.330 --> 03:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
any other discussion anybody want to
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
carry this for representative Bartlett
 
03:26:33.110 --> 03:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Barton moves that
 
03:26:33.120 --> 03:26:34.429 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Barton moves that
not

03:26:34.429 --> 03:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:26:39.650 --> 03:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:41.570 --> 03:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
again Michelle Heaton from the New
 
03:26:43.250 --> 03:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department
 
03:26:44.990 --> 03:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify under our current
 
03:26:47.330 --> 03:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
statutes if you want to do business of
 
03:26:49.610 --> 03:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
insurance in the commercial Market in
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you do have to be licensed
 
03:26:52.610 --> 03:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean your
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
domiciled here we have a number of
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that are domiciled
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
in other states but they have to be
 
03:27:00.650 --> 03:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire to do business
 
03:27:02.870 --> 03:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so that's one part of
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
it the second part of it is that we
 
03:27:05.279 --> 03:27:06.130 align:start position:0%
it the second part of it is that we
require

03:27:06.130 --> 03:27:06.140 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:27:08.450 --> 03:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
forms and rates to be filed with our
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
department for review to make sure
 
03:27:11.690 --> 03:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
they're meeting all of the requirements
 
03:27:13.490 --> 03:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire law before they can be
 
03:27:14.809 --> 03:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
sold here
 
03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
so if we were to allow
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
someone who was not licensed in New
 
03:27:22.490 --> 03:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to sell insurance products in
 
03:27:24.530 --> 03:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire essentially we would be
 
03:27:26.870 --> 03:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking away any regulation of that so
 
03:27:29.210 --> 03:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
they would have be able to sell products
 
03:27:30.769 --> 03:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire insurance
 
03:27:33.170 --> 03:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
department would not be regulating that
 
03:27:34.849 --> 03:27:34.859 align:start position:0%
those could be products that do not meet
 
03:27:37.130 --> 03:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
any of our consumer protections none of
 
03:27:38.570 --> 03:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
especially for major Med none of our
 
03:27:40.550 --> 03:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
mandates and then if there's a problem
 
03:27:42.590 --> 03:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
with it New Hampshire insurance
 
03:27:43.610 --> 03:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
department wouldn't have any
 
03:27:45.349 --> 03:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to try to resolve that
 
03:27:47.210 --> 03:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
issue or we wouldn't have any
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the insurance company
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's doing this unless they are
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
so that's just to clarify some of those
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
points representative aberson
 
03:28:01.490 --> 03:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
I feel like I asked this question a few
 
03:28:03.290 --> 03:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:28:03.300 --> 03:28:04.490 align:start position:0%
years ago
um

03:28:04.490 --> 03:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:06.170 --> 03:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
so we have so we have some people in
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
some companies and some small business
 
03:28:11.330 --> 03:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
quite a few small businesses that can't
 
03:28:14.090 --> 03:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
afford a regular you know full-on
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
private insurance plan
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
um my thought was and another reason
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
that I wanted this study committee to go
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
forward was
 
03:28:24.650 --> 03:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
could it be possible that you have say
 
03:28:26.330 --> 03:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
an insurance company that does operate
 
03:28:27.889 --> 03:28:27.899 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire follows the 44
 
03:28:29.990 --> 03:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
different Insurance mandates and and all
 
03:28:32.809 --> 03:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
the regulations would they be able if
 
03:28:34.729 --> 03:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
they have customers who can no longer
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
and forward the increases could they
 
03:28:39.590 --> 03:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
partner with say an out-of-state
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
insurance company or HMO or set up an
 
03:28:44.330 --> 03:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
out-of-state insurance company or HMO to
 
03:28:46.130 --> 03:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
offer a low-cost plan so that they don't
 
03:28:47.450 --> 03:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
lose those people
 
03:28:49.790 --> 03:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
03:28:49.800 --> 03:28:51.170 align:start position:0%
in other words
um

03:28:51.170 --> 03:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:53.570 --> 03:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
I I feel like what they were trying to
 
03:28:55.729 --> 03:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
do with with Obamacare in the exchange
 
03:28:58.969 --> 03:28:58.979 align:start position:0%
was if people couldn't get a regular
 
03:28:58.979 --> 03:29:00.710 align:start position:0%
was if people couldn't get a regular
full-blown

03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
full-blown
 
03:29:02.809 --> 03:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
You Know cover everything private
 
03:29:05.090 --> 03:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
insurance policy that the exchange was
 
03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to at least initially
 
03:29:09.530 --> 03:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
offer some low-cost options and maybe
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
even out-of-state insurance or buy
 
03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
something on the exchange that would be
 
03:29:14.450 --> 03:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
a lower cost option for people couldn't
 
03:29:16.429 --> 03:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
afford a regular plan so all the plans
 
03:29:17.809 --> 03:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
on the exchange sold in New Hampshire
 
03:29:19.969 --> 03:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire approved plans that
 
03:29:22.429 --> 03:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
have gone through the process so I don't
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
think that you're going to be able to
 
03:29:26.389 --> 03:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
realize that cost savings by going and
 
03:29:27.769 --> 03:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
getting a plan that's offered in another
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
state because every state has its own
 
03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
set of mandates and requirements so if
 
03:29:35.570 --> 03:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
you look at the cost of insurance
 
03:29:38.570 --> 03:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
Nationwide New Hampshire is typically on
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
the lower end of that
 
03:29:42.650 --> 03:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
are you actually listening to what she's
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
saying yes and but I haven't I have a
 
03:29:48.429 --> 03:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up it's somewhat unrelated
 
03:29:53.389 --> 03:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
but we just told you you're asking is I
 
03:29:56.929 --> 03:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
I have this fantasy that there is a
 
03:29:59.510 --> 03:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
health insurance light program out there
 
03:30:02.330 --> 03:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the mandates that
 
03:30:04.370 --> 03:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't have all that stuff and it's
 
03:30:06.590 --> 03:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
going to be cheaper
 
03:30:09.469 --> 03:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
and it's in another state somewhere
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
why are you labeling that a fantasy
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a fantasy
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
there is no that in the old days that
 
03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
was true when everybody had when some
 
03:30:24.530 --> 03:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
states had medical underwriting that's
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
where the savings was but in terms of
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
mandates yes it is true I think I did
 
03:30:31.250 --> 03:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
hear that we have more mandates than
 
03:30:33.530 --> 03:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
most States and I guess I have to take
 
03:30:35.210 --> 03:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility because I've been here
 
03:30:38.030 --> 03:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
when most of those mandates passed okay
 
03:30:40.250 --> 03:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
but mandates are only about five percent
 
03:30:43.490 --> 03:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
of the premium so the end of the day the
 
03:30:44.929 --> 03:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
real saving
 
03:30:46.969 --> 03:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
if you ever thought that there was
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
another insurance plan out there hiding
 
03:30:52.010 --> 03:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
on in some state
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
the real savings was under medical
 
03:30:57.050 --> 03:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
underwriting in which no state has that
 
03:30:57.060 --> 03:30:58.969 align:start position:0%
underwriting in which no state has that
anymore

03:30:58.969 --> 03:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:31:00.889 --> 03:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
so if I could ask the witness a
 
03:31:02.990 --> 03:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure
 
03:31:03.000 --> 03:31:04.250 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure
so

03:31:04.250 --> 03:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh the people in my town in Seabrook
 
03:31:10.130 --> 03:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
they can choose Portsmouth they can
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
choose Exeter they can choose Anna Jakes
 
03:31:13.790 --> 03:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
which is in Massachusetts
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
I think about half or maybe even 55
 
03:31:18.290 --> 03:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
according to the fire department
 
03:31:20.389 --> 03:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
choose to get taken Anna Jakes when they
 
03:31:22.610 --> 03:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
have the choice these are hospitals in
 
03:31:24.410 --> 03:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
my understanding okay since I'm On the
 
03:31:24.420 --> 03:31:25.550 align:start position:0%
my understanding okay since I'm On the
Border

03:31:25.550 --> 03:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
Border
 
03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
and again when I talk to people about
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
their doctor their doctor's office the
 
03:31:31.490 --> 03:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
clinics they go to about half or maybe
 
03:31:32.929 --> 03:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
even slightly more than half go down
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
into Massachusetts so there are
 
03:31:37.610 --> 03:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts insurance plans
 
03:31:38.990 --> 03:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
If people could buy health insurance
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
across state lines
 
03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't people even who happen
 
03:31:44.870 --> 03:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
to have a residence or happen to have a
 
03:31:46.610 --> 03:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
domicile here in New Hampshire be able
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
to buy into say an HMO in another
 
03:31:51.969 --> 03:31:51.979 align:start position:0%
neighboring state
 
03:31:54.290 --> 03:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
or a private insurance plan that's set
 
03:31:55.729 --> 03:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
up in another state where their Network
 
03:31:57.650 --> 03:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
their preferred provider network is
 
03:31:58.969 --> 03:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
primarily in that other state where
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
they're spending most of their health
 
03:32:02.150 --> 03:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
care dollars
 
03:32:04.250 --> 03:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a different issue
 
03:32:06.590 --> 03:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
there could be plans in New Hampshire
 
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
sold in New Hampshire approved by New
 
03:32:10.670 --> 03:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that include broader networks
 
03:32:12.110 --> 03:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
that would include all of those same
 
03:32:14.330 --> 03:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
networks in Massachusetts but that is a
 
03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
different issue than you know making
 
03:32:19.130 --> 03:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
sure that the insurance company is
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
licensed so there's
 
03:32:24.050 --> 03:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different parts to the
 
03:32:25.670 --> 03:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
insurance plan and I understand what
 
03:32:27.170 --> 03:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
you're saying about trying to get you
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
know cost savings but this particular
 
03:32:33.170 --> 03:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
bill here of allowing people to buy out
 
03:32:35.090 --> 03:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
of state plans just removes all of those
 
03:32:36.889 --> 03:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
consumer protections and the
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
Department's ability to regulate the
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
product so that is our concern but in
 
03:32:44.570 --> 03:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
theory you know there's no prohibitions
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
about a New Hampshire licensed company
 
03:32:49.250 --> 03:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
selling a plan that has a broad Network
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
that would include all of those same
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
providers in Massachusetts
 
03:32:56.690 --> 03:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes plans do have to include
 
03:32:58.910 --> 03:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
providers that are on those borders
 
03:32:58.920 --> 03:33:00.349 align:start position:0%
providers that are on those borders
because

03:33:00.349 --> 03:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:33:02.450 --> 03:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
that's where the care is to meet Network
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy requirements
 
03:33:07.130 --> 03:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
and then there's the ppos and hmos and
 
03:33:08.929 --> 03:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
that's a whole other question too so
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it at that thank you
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
very much Michelle
 
03:33:13.610 --> 03:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative mclayer do you want to
 
03:33:15.410 --> 03:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to give an example when
 
03:33:18.650 --> 03:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
I moved up from Massachusetts I had this
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh very inexpensive Tufts HMO and I mean
 
03:33:25.130 --> 03:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
the one that they went out of business
 
03:33:27.650 --> 03:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know about that but don't cut to
 
03:33:28.849 --> 03:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I said she said this is
 
03:33:30.410 --> 03:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
great I'm going to try to keep this I
 
03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
couldn't because that plan was not
 
03:33:35.450 --> 03:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
approved in New Hampshire and anybody
 
03:33:38.690 --> 03:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
from Seabrook can go to Anna Jake's
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital in their New Hampshire
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
insurance policy will pay Anna Jakes but
 
03:33:47.330 --> 03:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
you it's the whole thing is mute unless
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
that insurance company
 
03:33:52.729 --> 03:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
is licensed in New Hampshire you can't
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
buy that out of state product you simply
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
can't it's going to be it doesn't be
 
03:33:58.130 --> 03:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
again she said it doesn't have to be
 
03:34:00.650 --> 03:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
domiciled in New Hampshire but has to be
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
licensed in New Hampshire and and uh
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
basically uh controlled by New Hampshire
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
as far as rates go and ability to pay
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
and all that but what you're looking for
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
is an absolute oxymoron it does not
 
03:34:13.920 --> 03:34:16.670 align:start position:0%
is an absolute oxymoron it does not
exist

03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.680 --> 03:34:18.769 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:34:18.769 --> 03:34:18.779 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:34:20.330 --> 03:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
any more discussion all right
 
03:34:22.130 --> 03:34:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett will make a
 
03:34:25.070 --> 03:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
right motion uh not recommended for
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
future legislation all right next up uh
 
03:34:29.510 --> 03:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
1162 really uh requiring insurance
 
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
coverage for vaccination devices and
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
medication authorized for America I
 
03:34:37.090 --> 03:34:37.100 align:start position:0%
think we missed 10 28. oh I'm sorry
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:43.849 --> 03:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
okay 10 20 related to the form of
 
03:34:46.729 --> 03:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
individual health insurance policies
 
03:34:48.410 --> 03:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a department bill because
 
03:34:50.330 --> 03:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
that is that's
 
03:34:53.050 --> 03:34:53.060 align:start position:0%
this is the one with the um
 
03:34:56.210 --> 03:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
oh this is yeah okay yeah so that's
 
03:34:58.610 --> 03:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
right that's right
 
03:35:04.010 --> 03:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
so um this was an attempt to uh get more
 
03:35:06.530 --> 03:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
products into the individual Market by
 
03:35:09.429 --> 03:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
removing coverage
 
03:35:12.110 --> 03:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
the short-term products yeah so the
 
03:35:13.370 --> 03:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
short-term products are kind of an
 
03:35:15.290 --> 03:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
interesting story in this committee
 
03:35:16.969 --> 03:35:16.979 align:start position:0%
we've had we've dealt with them over the
 
03:35:16.979 --> 03:35:18.469 align:start position:0%
we've had we've dealt with them over the
years

03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:35:19.849 --> 03:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
um because they were really they were
 
03:35:22.969 --> 03:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
originally created for a lapse that if
 
03:35:26.929 --> 03:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
you're if you changed your employer and
 
03:35:29.809 --> 03:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
um you you don't have another employer
 
03:35:33.410 --> 03:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
yet you have a interim period that you
 
03:35:37.309 --> 03:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
certainly were eligible to COBRA under
 
03:35:39.050 --> 03:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
the cover law which is the three years
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
you could stay on your employers your
 
03:35:43.729 --> 03:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
former employers policy three years but
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
you had to pay both the employee and the
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
employer portion of it which would you
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
know be thousands of thousand dollars a
 
03:35:54.050 --> 03:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
month and nobody could afford that so
 
03:35:56.750 --> 03:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
the short-term policies
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
um were allowed and
 
03:36:01.870 --> 03:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
03:36:04.610 --> 03:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
they're a very stripped down they
 
03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
usually have a limits to how much you
 
03:36:09.050 --> 03:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
can cover which is some of them I
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
remember like ten thousand dollars it
 
03:36:13.250 --> 03:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
was a very limited plan it was a very
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
stripped Down plan
 
03:36:17.750 --> 03:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:36:21.050 --> 03:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
um it was always it an anathema to the
 
03:36:22.490 --> 03:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act because it didn't
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
really fit in it really violated the
 
03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
other functions of the uh of the statute
 
03:36:30.950 --> 03:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of what you're required and the
 
03:36:30.960 --> 03:36:32.570 align:start position:0%
in terms of what you're required and the
coverages

03:36:32.570 --> 03:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
coverages
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
um so but that they existed simply I
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
mean I remember one they were used to
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
you could get them in high schools high
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
schools used to sell for 100 bucks or
 
03:36:42.170 --> 03:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
ten bucks or something that you could
 
03:36:44.090 --> 03:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
get this life insurance plan but it was
 
03:36:46.490 --> 03:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
only like a thousand dollars and it
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't much coverage so but these were
 
03:36:50.450 --> 03:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
these this short term that I in my
 
03:36:51.889 --> 03:36:51.899 align:start position:0%
understanding if we're still selling
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
them in New Hampshire I assume they're
 
03:36:57.849 --> 03:36:57.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah one company okay but it's just a
 
03:37:03.290 --> 03:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
lapse just to cover that short period
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
until you find another employer well
 
03:37:07.130 --> 03:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
also it's very restricted coverage you
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
know Mental Health Coverage it's a very
 
03:37:11.690 --> 03:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
limited benefits
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's part of the reason why it's
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
so very much right so I would have to
 
03:37:16.969 --> 03:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
say this is very creative to come in
 
03:37:18.650 --> 03:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
with a bill like this because it's
 
03:37:20.809 --> 03:37:20.819 align:start position:0%
basically saying is let's pass something
 
03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
that will totally trample on the
 
03:37:25.070 --> 03:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act because all the
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
limitations all the requirements that
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
let's just go bypass it but uh it's a
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
nice idea but that
 
03:37:34.969 --> 03:37:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
so anybody want to speak towards this
 
03:37:39.530 --> 03:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
bill or otherwise represent a Bartlett's
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
going to make a motion to make it not
 
03:37:44.330 --> 03:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
03:37:47.330 --> 03:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative as usual it's an
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
option it it again we don't
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
whether something should be legal or
 
03:37:55.250 --> 03:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
illegal even if no one in the whole
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
state uses it or buys it or what have
 
03:37:57.779 --> 03:38:00.290 align:start position:0%
state uses it or buys it or what have
you

03:38:00.290 --> 03:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:02.690 --> 03:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
it should either be up to the individual
 
03:38:04.849 --> 03:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
or if something is physically impossible
 
03:38:06.650 --> 03:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
some of these ideas that people put
 
03:38:09.170 --> 03:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
forward are probably not possible but
 
03:38:10.849 --> 03:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that the state comes
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
on and says we're not going to let you
 
03:38:16.250 --> 03:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
send a rocket up or try to launch the
 
03:38:17.690 --> 03:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
first airplane because we think that
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's impossible just if the laws of
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
physics are going to stop something from
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
happening we let the laws of physics
 
03:38:25.130 --> 03:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
stop this is not about laws of physics
 
03:38:27.370 --> 03:38:27.380 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
we make the laws
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
okay we decide what's legal
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:38:37.729 --> 03:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
if you're saying we should pass feel
 
03:38:39.530 --> 03:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
good legislation just because we can
 
03:38:43.010 --> 03:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
save people we passed it we put this on
 
03:38:45.290 --> 03:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
our books so that somebody could take
 
03:38:46.849 --> 03:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
advantage of it
 
03:38:49.610 --> 03:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
but that when it comes down to it's
 
03:38:51.650 --> 03:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
never going to be used because
 
03:38:51.660 --> 03:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
never going to be used because
it

03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:38:55.849 --> 03:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
it the implementation or what to do
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
there's nobody out there who wants to do
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
or offer to do it
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's the sky's the limit just this just
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
pass all kinds of stuff but at some
 
03:39:06.290 --> 03:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
point isn't our responsibility to limit
 
03:39:08.090 --> 03:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
the amount of stuff we put in our books
 
03:39:10.490 --> 03:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
that we should only pass things that are
 
03:39:13.490 --> 03:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
are viable we shouldn't limit the
 
03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
products that are available in the
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
marketplace but it's not available buyer
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
but it's not available
 
03:39:22.250 --> 03:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
we so what I'm saying is what should the
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
government do what should the state do
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
my answer is the state should never
 
03:39:28.670 --> 03:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
restrict anything
 
03:39:31.250 --> 03:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh when it's just one individual buying
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
a product from someone else
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's one individual buying insurance
 
03:39:38.090 --> 03:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
or a policy from someone else even if we
 
03:39:39.769 --> 03:39:39.779 align:start position:0%
don't agree that it's a good idea or
 
03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's not good enough for you or even if
 
03:39:43.190 --> 03:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's not offered we don't duplicate
 
03:39:45.410 --> 03:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
federal law we don't duplicate the laws
 
03:39:47.870 --> 03:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
of physics if lawsuit physics are going
 
03:39:49.130 --> 03:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
to prevent it from happening we don't
 
03:39:50.570 --> 03:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
need an extra restriction
 
03:39:53.210 --> 03:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
03:39:56.090 --> 03:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think representative everson's
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
reference to the laws of physics has to
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
do with Innovation right like the
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
airplane was just an example of
 
03:40:02.809 --> 03:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
something new that people may be
 
03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
skeptical of
 
03:40:06.650 --> 03:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
um this bill is to strike language it's
 
03:40:09.290 --> 03:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
not to add anything that's true right
 
03:40:11.210 --> 03:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
um but it does give us a
 
03:40:13.309 --> 03:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to look at
 
03:40:16.610 --> 03:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
you know these many arbitrary limits and
 
03:40:19.849 --> 03:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
deadlines and you know numbers that
 
03:40:22.130 --> 03:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
somebody put into law
 
03:40:24.190 --> 03:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
Commerce statues are full of them right
 
03:40:26.990 --> 03:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
so you know should we make it nine
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
months instead of six months you know is
 
03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
there something we can do I think
 
03:40:32.929 --> 03:40:32.939 align:start position:0%
there's a rollover isn't there a six
 
03:40:34.910 --> 03:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
month rollover
 
03:40:36.530 --> 03:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
if you had the six months and then our
 
03:40:41.090 --> 03:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:43.130 --> 03:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
because the statute says just six months
 
03:40:45.290 --> 03:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
right yeah it says six months um yeah
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
you know if there is an opportunity for
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
future legislation it's an opportunity
 
03:40:54.290 --> 03:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
to look at these seemingly arbitrary
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
cutoffs and maybe adjust them to fit
 
03:40:59.090 --> 03:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
reality better
 
03:41:01.010 --> 03:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
yeah but you have to remember this is
 
03:41:03.769 --> 03:41:03.779 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of what are but the
 
03:41:05.090 --> 03:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
products that are available licensed
 
03:41:06.410 --> 03:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
products in the state
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's we should we would have and
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
actually we got we got burnt a little
 
03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
bit with that religious exemption we had
 
03:41:15.290 --> 03:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
that we created this religious plan and
 
03:41:17.630 --> 03:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
sure enough that company you know did
 
03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:19.910 align:start position:0%
sure enough that company you know did
they

03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:41:22.130 --> 03:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
you know we we bend over backwards to
 
03:41:24.050 --> 03:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
help them out you know to allow them to
 
03:41:27.229 --> 03:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
be legal but it turns out that they they
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't cover the cup make the cover of
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
the people that was Christian neutral so
 
03:41:33.790 --> 03:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
that's how that's sort of
 
03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
representative's uh analogy to laws of
 
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
physics right they couldn't do it well
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
so they didn't well they could have but
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
they just they I mean I guess
 
03:41:44.510 --> 03:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
financially they just weren't Smart in
 
03:41:46.130 --> 03:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
terms of you know that they could have
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
said to some people we're going to limit
 
03:41:49.190 --> 03:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
the benefits or they're gonna they
 
03:41:50.570 --> 03:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
should have the premiums weren't high
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
enough I think is really problems so
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
let's talk about cases the six months is
 
03:41:55.849 --> 03:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
it the Nixon why is it six months why is
 
03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
it six months because we we want them to
 
03:42:03.729 --> 03:42:03.739 align:start position:0%
buy a regular licensed product because
 
03:42:06.110 --> 03:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's the that's health and that's
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
adequate health insurance I mean you
 
03:42:09.309 --> 03:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
know we used to say it wasn't just
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
unaffordable it was underinsured the
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
expression of underinsured that you
 
03:42:16.370 --> 03:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
think you have an insurance product
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
right but then you realize when you go
 
03:42:20.210 --> 03:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
make the claim
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cover anything it's not it's
 
03:42:25.370 --> 03:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's too skimpy so you were under
 
03:42:27.290 --> 03:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
insured you didn't have enough shirts
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
that you thought you so we don't want
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
anybody to have the illusion that
 
03:42:34.010 --> 03:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
they're buying a a a viable Insurance
 
03:42:36.950 --> 03:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
product so if they're under No Illusion
 
03:42:39.469 --> 03:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
it's better to have limited Insurance
 
03:42:41.630 --> 03:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
than no insurance right so right that's
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's the consumer protection quote
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
unquote consumer protection we're not
 
03:42:46.729 --> 03:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
going to allow you to buy something
 
03:42:49.969 --> 03:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
that's not you're we potentially you
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
won't know won't work so you could say
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
is well can we have some kind of
 
03:42:55.849 --> 03:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
disclosure that the person fully
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
understands but next month's here they
 
03:42:58.560 --> 03:42:59.690 align:start position:0%
understands but next month's here they
they

03:42:59.690 --> 03:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:43:02.929 --> 03:43:02.939 align:start position:0%
or banned from having this option at all
 
03:43:04.969 --> 03:43:04.979 align:start position:0%
and they could be uninsured completely
 
03:43:07.969 --> 03:43:07.979 align:start position:0%
right uh we would hope that in the six
 
03:43:09.769 --> 03:43:09.779 align:start position:0%
months they would got themselves into
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
their highly subsidized individual
 
03:43:15.410 --> 03:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that under our that we
 
03:43:18.349 --> 03:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
created I mean if you're unemployed you
 
03:43:20.210 --> 03:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
can buy into the marketplace for you
 
03:43:22.429 --> 03:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
know like 25 a month I mean it's it's
 
03:43:24.889 --> 03:43:24.899 align:start position:0%
dirt cheap I mean there is there are
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
actually better Alternatives so please
 
03:43:28.969 --> 03:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
don't avoid it
 
03:43:31.250 --> 03:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
you know that that this was a leftover
 
03:43:34.250 --> 03:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
from the the old days that it was a
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
short-term policy and like you say we
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
have one company but I bet you they
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
don't even have a thousand lives I don't
 
03:43:41.150 --> 03:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
think they have many I'm not sure that
 
03:43:42.530 --> 03:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
we have numbers on how many lives they
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
cover but it is one company and just
 
03:43:47.929 --> 03:43:47.939 align:start position:0%
clarify the policy itself is at Max six
 
03:43:50.570 --> 03:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
months right but it can be renewed up
 
03:43:53.210 --> 03:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
into the for coverage for no more than
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
540 days and like you said the idea is
 
03:43:57.889 --> 03:43:57.899 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't have insurance and
 
03:43:59.870 --> 03:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's no open enrollment enrollment
 
03:44:02.210 --> 03:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
period and they don't qualify for a
 
03:44:03.769 --> 03:44:03.779 align:start position:0%
special enrollment period which if you
 
03:44:05.870 --> 03:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
lose a job you lose coverage that would
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
qualify you for a special enrollment
 
03:44:09.229 --> 03:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
period where you can buy regular major
 
03:44:11.269 --> 03:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
Med coverage but if you fall outside of
 
03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
this these types of policies are
 
03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
considered kind of like a stop Gap
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
however even if we got rid of our
 
03:44:20.690 --> 03:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
restrictions on these plans federal law
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
dictates how long these can go so
 
03:44:25.490 --> 03:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
there's still federal law that would
 
03:44:27.889 --> 03:44:27.899 align:start position:0%
limit the applicability of these and
 
03:44:29.809 --> 03:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
these plans do not comply AI with all of
 
03:44:31.849 --> 03:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
the ACA requirements there's a lot of
 
03:44:34.790 --> 03:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
pre-existing pre-existing condition
 
03:44:37.250 --> 03:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
exclusions it's not guaranteed renewable
 
03:44:40.670 --> 03:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
so it is not and a replacement for major
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
Med also there's the argument that if we
 
03:44:47.150 --> 03:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
were to allow these notwithstanding
 
03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
federal law if we were allow people to
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
purchase these regularly it's taking the
 
03:44:53.750 --> 03:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
healthier people out of the individual
 
03:44:55.729 --> 03:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
insurance market and then that could
 
03:44:57.889 --> 03:44:57.899 align:start position:0%
affect rates over time as well
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of like socialism works
 
03:45:02.809 --> 03:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
when everybody is part of it right
 
03:45:05.330 --> 03:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the argument uh well I
 
03:45:07.330 --> 03:45:07.340 align:start position:0%
guess the only expression is Insurance
 
03:45:10.010 --> 03:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
works best if we can get everybody to
 
03:45:11.330 --> 03:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
buy into it
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
in other words you don't that you the
 
03:45:15.650 --> 03:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
more people who buy in Insurance than
 
03:45:18.530 --> 03:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
the lower the premium is so yeah because
 
03:45:20.210 --> 03:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
you're spreading the risk but you can't
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
let people do something different
 
03:45:25.190 --> 03:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
well you could do something different
 
03:45:27.889 --> 03:45:27.899 align:start position:0%
it's called don't buy any insurance now
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
which that it what we're saying is and
 
03:45:34.130 --> 03:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
here's the good that if don't be
 
03:45:37.370 --> 03:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh don't have the illusion that because
 
03:45:39.769 --> 03:45:39.779 align:start position:0%
you've got this product you really have
 
03:45:42.290 --> 03:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
insurance you don't this is not
 
03:45:46.130 --> 03:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
insurance this is a feel-good idea that
 
03:45:48.170 --> 03:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
you have some kind of catastrophic
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
policy but at the end of the day you are
 
03:45:52.969 --> 03:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
going to be if you ever to make a claim
 
03:45:54.530 --> 03:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to be extremely
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
disappointed and come back to us and say
 
03:45:59.690 --> 03:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
why the hell did you let let me buy that
 
03:46:02.269 --> 03:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay so make it illegal completely right
 
03:46:04.610 --> 03:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
we could have we could we could have
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
done that all right we could have done
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
that and then technically that's what
 
03:46:10.250 --> 03:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act did is made
 
03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
these plans illegal but then we went
 
03:46:14.150 --> 03:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
back and revised them and said let's
 
03:46:16.790 --> 03:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
give them some short let's give him some
 
03:46:19.729 --> 03:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
life because there are consumers in New
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who just want to have this as
 
03:46:25.610 --> 03:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
a stop Gap measure
 
03:46:28.130 --> 03:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson
 
03:46:28.140 --> 03:46:29.750 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson
so

03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
I want to give you an example we had
 
03:46:33.889 --> 03:46:33.899 align:start position:0%
some left-wing activists come in
 
03:46:36.290 --> 03:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
and they were holding signs for the
 
03:46:38.210 --> 03:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and I talked to some of
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
them and they said that they wanted a 33
 
03:46:43.250 --> 03:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
an hour minimum wage plus full medical
 
03:46:46.729 --> 03:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
plus full benefits and so I asked
 
03:46:48.889 --> 03:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
what do you do to all the people who
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
currently can't earn 33 dollars an hour
 
03:46:53.630 --> 03:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
plus you know the full benefits package
 
03:46:56.450 --> 03:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have an answer and I
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
said so are you saying you want to ban
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
all everything that's below your
 
03:47:00.479 --> 03:47:01.910 align:start position:0%
all everything that's below your
standard

03:47:01.910 --> 03:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
standard
 
03:47:04.729 --> 03:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
there's more than half the people in my
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
town in Seabrook make less than 33
 
03:47:09.050 --> 03:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour so you're going to be
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
putting more than half the people in my
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
town out of work with your proposal if
 
03:47:17.210 --> 03:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
you continuously say we're going to ban
 
03:47:21.170 --> 03:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
every option between zero and whatever
 
03:47:23.450 --> 03:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
we want then everyone who's currently
 
03:47:23.460 --> 03:47:24.410 align:start position:0%
we want then everyone who's currently
stuck

03:47:24.410 --> 03:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
stuck
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know working for unskilled less
 
03:47:29.450 --> 03:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
skilled partially retired coming right
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
out of college whatever coming right out
 
03:47:33.769 --> 03:47:33.779 align:start position:0%
of high school all of those options are
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
taken away you're only leaving behind
 
03:47:38.450 --> 03:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
All or Nothing instead of letting people
 
03:47:41.870 --> 03:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
get a basic entry-level plan people have
 
03:47:43.550 --> 03:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
to kind of start somewhere and start
 
03:47:43.560 --> 03:47:45.469 align:start position:0%
to kind of start somewhere and start
getting

03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
getting
 
03:47:47.210 --> 03:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
um establish you put if you push the
 
03:47:49.010 --> 03:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
Bottom Rung of the economic ladder too
 
03:47:51.889 --> 03:47:51.899 align:start position:0%
high people can't get anything and 30
 
03:47:53.570 --> 03:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
million Americans have nothing they have
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing and then another 20
 
03:47:58.250 --> 03:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
some odd million have Medicaid and
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
everyone I've talked to who's on
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid said that that's sometimes
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
worse than nothing so let me ask you is
 
03:48:07.969 --> 03:48:07.979 align:start position:0%
it better off what you're asking is just
 
03:48:10.729 --> 03:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
have a policy out there
 
03:48:14.090 --> 03:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
that has the absolute right that as soon
 
03:48:16.729 --> 03:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
as you make one claim
 
03:48:19.849 --> 03:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
they can cancel the policy
 
03:48:22.790 --> 03:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
and you're saying is it's better off for
 
03:48:25.130 --> 03:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
us to offer that option to allow people
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
to buy that product
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
knowing full well that as soon as they
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
make a claim they'll get canceled
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
then just going with representative
 
03:48:39.170 --> 03:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
images root says is we should just ban
 
03:48:40.370 --> 03:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
them all together
 
03:48:42.050 --> 03:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't we shouldn't let them to be
 
03:48:42.060 --> 03:48:46.269 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't we shouldn't let them to be
available

03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
that otherwise the right thing to do is
 
03:48:52.130 --> 03:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
we should have just stuck to our guns
 
03:48:55.130 --> 03:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
which is we have made a decision in New
 
03:48:57.889 --> 03:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that nobody should lose their
 
03:48:57.899 --> 03:48:59.090 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that nobody should lose their
policy

03:48:59.090 --> 03:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
simply because they made a claim
 
03:49:05.090 --> 03:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
we think that is consumer product we
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
think it's fraudulent to sell a product
 
03:49:11.570 --> 03:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
that as soon as you make the claim they
 
03:49:13.690 --> 03:49:13.700 align:start position:0%
cancel you and you don't have it anymore
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we should just repeal this whole
 
03:49:19.330 --> 03:49:19.340 align:start position:0%
statute altogether 30 million Americans
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
the result of they have no insurance the
 
03:49:23.870 --> 03:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
30 million you're talking about are the
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
people who have no insurance you get to
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
your first claim
 
03:49:28.969 --> 03:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
and you get nothing
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's true those 30 million people have
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
they they have a claim they got to pay
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
for it out of pocket but they got to
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
save all that money
 
03:49:40.010 --> 03:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
that they didn't waste on powering
 
03:49:40.020 --> 03:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
that they didn't waste on powering
something

03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
that was fraudulent but what I'm saying
 
03:49:48.650 --> 03:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
is for those people they before you came
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
along they get two options you come
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
along you take away one of those options
 
03:49:54.050 --> 03:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
you didn't give them anything by Banning
 
03:49:55.729 --> 03:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
an option that doesn't meet your
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
approval I'm saying that's not even an
 
03:49:59.389 --> 03:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that's not even a great
 
03:50:01.969 --> 03:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
insurance plan it's arguably not even a
 
03:50:04.610 --> 03:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
health insurance plan that's a one-time
 
03:50:07.490 --> 03:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
payout it's a one-time thing it's like
 
03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:13.370 --> 03:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
Yeah well yeah you only get paid out one
 
03:50:15.530 --> 03:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
time with life insurance hopefully
 
03:50:15.540 --> 03:50:17.450 align:start position:0%
time with life insurance hopefully
however

03:50:17.450 --> 03:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:50:20.210 --> 03:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
that's it some people you got it you got
 
03:50:21.469 --> 03:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
it some people have gotten it that's
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
what it is that's what it was that if
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
users you make a claim ban okay so
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's not a great plan well should we
 
03:50:30.170 --> 03:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
make those legal should those be legal
 
03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as an individual if you
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
choose knowingly to buy that plan
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's up to you but how do we how do we
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
make sure so we have to and have this
 
03:50:42.889 --> 03:50:42.899 align:start position:0%
informed consent by the way this is a
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
One-Shot plan that if you want this plan
 
03:50:48.469 --> 03:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
you have to understand that you only get
 
03:50:51.410 --> 03:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that's how we make them
 
03:50:54.769 --> 03:50:54.779 align:start position:0%
that's all that's available to them at
 
03:50:57.290 --> 03:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
that price point that they can afford if
 
03:50:59.090 --> 03:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
they can only get the low-cost option if
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
someone can only afford a used car we
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
don't ban used cars we don't have a I
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
didn't support the Cash for Clunkers
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing where they got rid of lots of used
 
03:51:08.809 --> 03:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
cars okay so
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
this particular legislation as it's
 
03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:12.769 align:start position:0%
this particular legislation as it's
written

03:51:12.769 --> 03:51:12.779 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:51:14.690 --> 03:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
but representative Ammon who's now been
 
03:51:21.910 --> 03:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
inspired by how how do we allow people
 
03:51:26.690 --> 03:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
to buy a plan that will expire as soon
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
as they make a claim
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
and as long as they know ahead of time
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
as long as they know I mean we're
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
expiring it for them after 540 days
 
03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
whether they make a claim or not we're
 
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
telling you they need to find something
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
else yeah they're telling them they
 
03:51:41.929 --> 03:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
might have paid money in all that time
 
03:51:43.190 --> 03:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
and never made it yeah that's true
 
03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's what that's that's why people
 
03:51:47.510 --> 03:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
hate insurance pay for years and I never
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
make a claim that's right correct it's a
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
huge racket but you know why we have
 
03:51:56.570 --> 03:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
cheap you know uh you know Property and
 
03:51:58.670 --> 03:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
Casualty and auto insurance in the state
 
03:52:01.250 --> 03:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
is because none of us make claims
 
03:52:03.769 --> 03:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
so the prime sponsor is currently under
 
03:52:03.779 --> 03:52:04.969 align:start position:0%
so the prime sponsor is currently under
uh

03:52:04.969 --> 03:52:04.979 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:08.450 --> 03:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
some uh pretty severe cancer I know
 
03:52:10.490 --> 03:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's true that's right so I'll reach I
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
need to call him anyway yeah I'll I'll
 
03:52:15.050 --> 03:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
bounce uh ideas off for next time and
 
03:52:20.150 --> 03:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
we'll see perfect yeah okay no I I yeah
 
03:52:24.530 --> 03:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I forgot about that okay but
 
03:52:26.570 --> 03:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
actually this is actually a wonderful
 
03:52:28.729 --> 03:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
conversation because I think it really
 
03:52:32.150 --> 03:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
helps everyone here to understand what
 
03:52:34.190 --> 03:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
health insurance in this state and
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
really across the country what it really
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
is all about and where how we got to
 
03:52:40.190 --> 03:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
where we are so I I do not take anything
 
03:52:42.170 --> 03:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
away from this conversation
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:49.250 --> 03:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative Grayson
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
yes not 1162. 1162 no no that's right
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is 1162. so this one did we ever
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
have a problem then Insurance any
 
03:53:03.050 --> 03:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
insurance company did not cover a
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine you're a co-sponsor did anybody
 
03:53:08.210 --> 03:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
ever hear that this 1162 really was a
 
03:53:08.220 --> 03:53:11.870 align:start position:0%
ever hear that this 1162 really was a
problem

03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.880 --> 03:53:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
I mean the vaccines if we're talking
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
about coveted vaccines they're basically
 
03:53:20.150 --> 03:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
free right yeah it's all free
 
03:53:22.190 --> 03:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
03:53:26.450 --> 03:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
yeah it's 11 62. so the concern was that
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody were to receive a vaccine
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh primarily of concern or the coveted
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines which are not FDA approved no
 
03:53:41.870 --> 03:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
one absolutely no one has ever gotten an
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
FDA approved coveted vaccine it is not
 
03:53:46.729 --> 03:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
on the market and never has been and
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
never will be on the market right that's
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
not conjecture that's a fact
 
03:53:53.690 --> 03:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
so you have received an experimental
 
03:53:53.700 --> 03:53:54.590 align:start position:0%
so you have received an experimental
drug

03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
drug
 
03:53:58.190 --> 03:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
and insurance companies are not required
 
03:54:01.849 --> 03:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
to cover any claims
 
03:54:04.190 --> 03:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
based on you having taken an
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
experimental drug
 
03:54:08.330 --> 03:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
and so the concern was somebody would
 
03:54:11.090 --> 03:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
get a coveted vaccine would get injured
 
03:54:12.849 --> 03:54:12.859 align:start position:0%
by that which we know that never happens
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
and then they would file a claim that
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
would be denied they wouldn't get
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
coverage as it appears uh no one has
 
03:54:21.950 --> 03:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
chalked up any injuries to coveted
 
03:54:24.349 --> 03:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines and so it's being covered by
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know teenage kids automatically get
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
myocarditis at the rates that we're
 
03:54:29.809 --> 03:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
seeing now anyway so we're going to go
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
ahead and cover it anyway so nothing has
 
03:54:34.250 --> 03:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
ever been actually attributed to any of
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
the coveted vaccines but uh the concern
 
03:54:40.610 --> 03:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
was that you would get a vaccine be
 
03:54:41.929 --> 03:54:41.939 align:start position:0%
injured and then your insurance company
 
03:54:44.210 --> 03:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cover it and so this bill was
 
03:54:46.729 --> 03:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
to prevent a an insurance company from
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
denying you coverage because you
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
received this experimental vaccine got
 
03:54:52.560 --> 03:54:54.490 align:start position:0%
received this experimental vaccine got
it

03:54:54.490 --> 03:54:54.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:54:57.229 --> 03:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
and do we have we heard any evidence
 
03:54:59.870 --> 03:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
that this didn't occur well that's
 
03:55:01.130 --> 03:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
because nobody was ever injured by the
 
03:55:01.140 --> 03:55:03.110 align:start position:0%
because nobody was ever injured by the
vaccine

03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:05.809 align:start position:0%
vaccine
#sarcasm

03:55:05.809 --> 03:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
#sarcasm
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay so you want to make the motion
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
you'll write the word for me and that's
 
03:55:14.160 --> 03:55:18.530 align:start position:0%
you'll write the word for me and that's
okay

03:55:18.530 --> 03:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:18.540 --> 03:55:21.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.250 --> 03:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.260 --> 03:55:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:32.030 --> 03:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
so the uh this this bill it was the
 
03:55:37.510 --> 03:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury Compensation Program
 
03:55:41.570 --> 03:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
which was uh modeled after the federal
 
03:55:45.290 --> 03:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
program but to cover uh vaccines not
 
03:55:46.849 --> 03:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
03:55:50.090 --> 03:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
the federal program was trying not to
 
03:55:51.769 --> 03:55:51.779 align:start position:0%
conflict with that with the issues at
 
03:55:54.530 --> 03:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
the beginning were preemption and it is
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
a valid concern with that uh and after
 
03:55:59.170 --> 03:55:59.180 align:start position:0%
speaking with vaccine injury attorneys
 
03:56:01.849 --> 03:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
they did assure me that any compensation
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
that anybody received for any vaccine
 
03:56:05.929 --> 03:56:05.939 align:start position:0%
injury would work against them in the
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
federal program so that kind of defeated
 
03:56:11.210 --> 03:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
the intent behind the bill uh it was to
 
03:56:13.010 --> 03:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
not interfere with anybody's ability to
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
participate in that program that program
 
03:56:17.090 --> 03:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
is horribly inefficient and is it takes
 
03:56:20.150 --> 03:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
five years on average to to get any kind
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
of claim and over two-thirds of claims
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
are rejected without ever seeing the
 
03:56:26.510 --> 03:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
light of day and so it's a it's a
 
03:56:29.389 --> 03:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
actually a terrible program uh for most
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
people and it takes forever for those
 
03:56:33.950 --> 03:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
that it does end up providing any uh
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
satisfaction for uh and so this was to
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
be a state level program uh funding was
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
was a concern and didn't really nail
 
03:56:44.210 --> 03:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
down uh the best way to fund the program
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
and so at this point it's kind of moot
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
any anyway the damage has been done and
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
there's no going back and I don't think
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's any way of
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
there's really no way of going forward
 
03:56:56.929 --> 03:56:56.939 align:start position:0%
so I'm I have no problem with this thing
 
03:56:59.290 --> 03:56:59.300 align:start position:0%
never never going into going forward
 
03:57:02.210 --> 03:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
you're willing to make that motion and
 
03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
right to blurb yeah uh yeah okay well
 
03:57:08.090 --> 03:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:09.769 --> 03:57:09.779 align:start position:0%
not that it was a bad idea in the
 
03:57:11.870 --> 03:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
beginning the bond versus insurance was
 
03:57:14.210 --> 03:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
a big problem but I didn't say the
 
03:57:16.010 --> 03:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
funding was perfect trying to find a
 
03:57:17.450 --> 03:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
funding source
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's all it was I always say every
 
03:57:23.570 --> 03:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
bill has a grain of truth to it
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
the devil's in the details
 
03:57:26.040 --> 03:57:27.229 align:start position:0%
the devil's in the details
okay

03:57:27.229 --> 03:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
last but not least 1019 salvation
 
03:57:31.969 --> 03:57:31.979 align:start position:0%
committee to study the replacement of
 
03:57:33.650 --> 03:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
certain professional licensees with
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum liability insurance
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
requirements I'm glad to make the motion
 
03:57:40.370 --> 03:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
that this not be recommended for okay
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
further uh legislation is there anybody
 
03:57:46.250 --> 03:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
here well I have to say this was a very
 
03:57:48.469 --> 03:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
creative idea I mean I talk about every
 
03:57:50.570 --> 03:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
bill has the grain of Truth this is very
 
03:57:54.170 --> 03:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
creative concept but it did violate one
 
03:57:56.210 --> 03:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
of John Hunt's rules
 
03:57:59.689 --> 03:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
and John Hunt's rules of licensure which
 
03:58:03.170 --> 03:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
you all know by now right the purpose of
 
03:58:05.090 --> 03:58:05.100 align:start position:0%
how to regulate something and I always
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
give an example is we had this bill
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
years ago uh to license contractors
 
03:58:14.330 --> 03:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
how many you drive in other states and
 
03:58:16.130 --> 03:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
you all see they got the licensed
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
contractor and the contractor license in
 
03:58:20.570 --> 03:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
the state and why do they have licensed
 
03:58:20.580 --> 03:58:21.889 align:start position:0%
the state and why do they have licensed
contractors

03:58:21.889 --> 03:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
can they regulate those like can they
 
03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually give continued education to
 
03:58:29.450 --> 03:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
contractors are they doing it no the
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
only reason we create licensure is so we
 
03:58:35.210 --> 03:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
have a vehicle that when you screw up
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
and you do something bad or harm
 
03:58:40.010 --> 03:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
somebody or take their money we take
 
03:58:44.030 --> 03:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
your license away from you
 
03:58:46.490 --> 03:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
so consumer protection is one aspect of
 
03:58:51.469 --> 03:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
licensure but there's another aspect
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's protectionism for the entrenched
 
03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
injuries in the industry so we want to
 
03:58:58.610 --> 03:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
balance those two forces right
 
03:59:01.670 --> 03:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely and that's why Joel Winters
 
03:59:03.729 --> 03:59:03.739 align:start position:0%
that libertarian
 
03:59:07.250 --> 03:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
Democrat who carried the flag for this
 
03:59:09.769 --> 03:59:09.779 align:start position:0%
committee to help kill that build when
 
03:59:12.290 --> 03:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
we had licensed contractors because yes
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
problem with licensure is now it's
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
protective of those who have the license
 
03:59:21.830 --> 03:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
now you have limited the market to how
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
many people can get in that business A
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
and B that gives them the power to have
 
03:59:30.170 --> 03:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
higher rates charge more because they
 
03:59:31.370 --> 03:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
have that privilege of having the
 
03:59:35.809 --> 03:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.929 --> 03:59:38.939 align:start position:0%
just the grain of uh you know
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
interesting idea to this bill I think
 
03:59:44.689 --> 03:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
it's too cross-cutting it it would upset
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
every licensed industry so I think we
 
03:59:49.070 --> 03:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
might want to be a little more careful
 
03:59:51.530 --> 03:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
how it's applied but but maybe you know
 
03:59:54.410 --> 03:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
we could apply this to some uh to some
 
03:59:57.170 --> 03:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
Industries keep this idea in mind as we
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
go forward maybe it's an option no I
 
04:00:00.410 --> 04:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
think absolutely it was a very
 
04:00:02.210 --> 04:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
interesting concept but instead of
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
having a committee just say let's go
 
04:00:05.210 --> 04:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
through the books and thumb through the
 
04:00:07.130 --> 04:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
books and find a license that he needed
 
04:00:09.530 --> 04:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
to come in with a certain profession
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
that he could argue that there was no
 
04:00:16.250 --> 04:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
benefit of the licensure process but
 
04:00:18.229 --> 04:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
that you would uh you would have the
 
04:00:20.570 --> 04:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
insurance how I would say that but I
 
04:00:22.370 --> 04:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
would have to mention that and she's
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
left she was here all day but she uh she
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
represents the professional insurance
 
04:00:30.650 --> 04:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
companies and agents and her comment was
 
04:00:34.610 --> 04:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
you can cancel an insurance policy the
 
04:00:36.650 --> 04:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
very next day
 
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
so my argument about why we don't need
 
04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory auto insurance in this state
 
04:00:44.570 --> 04:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
is that the drawback is you can get that
 
04:00:47.689 --> 04:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
insurance get your registration
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then go down to and cancel that
 
04:00:53.450 --> 04:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
insurance the next day
 
04:00:55.729 --> 04:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
I've heard that happens in other states
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
I know but I heard that happens another
 
04:00:58.080 --> 04:00:59.570 align:start position:0%
I know but I heard that happens another
stage

04:00:59.570 --> 04:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
stage
 
04:01:02.150 --> 04:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's right exactly so I've heard that
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
happen in the United States so again the
 
04:01:07.010 --> 04:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
problem with insurance is how do you you
 
04:01:09.710 --> 04:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
still need to have some oversight to
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
ensure that that liability policy was
 
04:01:14.689 --> 04:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
still in place at all times you know
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right I think the example
 
04:01:20.570 --> 04:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
was scuba diving if I remember the and
 
04:01:23.330 --> 04:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
that they're not licensed but the market
 
04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
sort of regulates and it's an example of
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
an industry where people's lives are
 
04:01:29.229 --> 04:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
maybe at risk very much
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
but it seems to have worked out in that
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
industry where you know it's a private
 
04:01:36.530 --> 04:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
requirement but how much does the people
 
04:01:38.570 --> 04:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
really take prove to me that you really
 
04:01:38.580 --> 04:01:39.530 align:start position:0%
really take prove to me that you really
have

04:01:39.530 --> 04:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:01:39.540 --> 04:01:41.630 align:start position:0%
have
insurance

04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:01:43.309 --> 04:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
how does anybody really know if that
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
scuba diver really is fully insured on
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
the spectrum of uh people that are
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
highly informed to
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's probably something you
 
04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
asked that question when you scuba that
 
04:01:54.370 --> 04:01:54.380 align:start position:0%
you scuba that's not my thing
 
04:01:57.170 --> 04:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
about the fully insured lager on the
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
side of their truck fully injured yeah
 
04:02:01.849 --> 04:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
right yeah ask for a Certificate of
 
04:02:01.859 --> 04:02:03.610 align:start position:0%
right yeah ask for a Certificate of
Insurance

04:02:03.610 --> 04:02:03.620 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
04:02:05.689 --> 04:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
what's the point I always ask for that
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
Certificate of Insurance before any
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
contractor that is true representative
 
04:02:10.680 --> 04:02:13.429 align:start position:0%
contractor that is true representative
Abramson

04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.439 --> 04:02:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:15.650 --> 04:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to make a point that's why I
 
04:02:18.170 --> 04:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
put my hand up first
 
04:02:21.290 --> 04:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
um so I went to see for a living for 12
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
years and we have both uh obviously
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory insurance for merchant ships
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
to cover any potential damage that they
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
might do and then of course there's also
 
04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Coast Guard inspectors and then
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
their OSHA inspectors and by far the the
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
toughest not only the toughest
 
04:02:39.170 --> 04:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
inspectors but also the best information
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
the best education comes from abs abs is
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
a private company where all the
 
04:02:45.769 --> 04:02:45.779 align:start position:0%
insurance shipping insurance companies
 
04:02:47.809 --> 04:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
what is ABS
 
04:02:49.130 --> 04:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember what it stands for
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
this was quite a few years ago but is it
 
04:02:53.269 --> 04:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
they they send their inspectors on with
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
some really fancy equipment to to to
 
04:02:57.889 --> 04:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
check everything and what I found is
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
when insurance companies are providing
 
04:03:03.410 --> 04:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
coverage that's in the Millions
 
04:03:05.210 --> 04:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
um that they make absolutely sure that
 
04:03:07.370 --> 04:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
you're you're on top of everything and
 
04:03:09.710 --> 04:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
they are way ahead of governmental
 
04:03:11.389 --> 04:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
agencies and inspecting things and the
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
standards are also higher at least in
 
04:03:12.720 --> 04:03:14.330 align:start position:0%
standards are also higher at least in
shipping

04:03:14.330 --> 04:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
04:03:14.340 --> 04:03:15.469 align:start position:0%
shipping
um

04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:19.849 --> 04:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
so my thought is if you know if if it's
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
good enough for business why isn't it
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
good enough for individuals I would much
 
04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
at some point when you contract with a
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
private professional you've got to look
 
04:03:28.969 --> 04:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
for some piece of paper and it's either
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
going to say licensed by the state or
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
private insured and and I thought that
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
this study committee was worth going
 
04:03:38.030 --> 04:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
forward and looking into and look you
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
know opening up this can of worms
 
04:03:42.530 --> 04:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
because I thought that we might get
 
04:03:45.650 --> 04:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
better standards by having literally
 
04:03:47.330 --> 04:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
having private insurance companies that
 
04:03:48.650 --> 04:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
could operate in any state and bring
 
04:03:51.530 --> 04:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
them bring in their expertise from other
 
04:03:53.689 --> 04:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
states and other countries to use scuba
 
04:03:55.010 --> 04:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
um scuba is an underwriter's laboratory
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
and these uh others IEEE they all do
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
different types of certification it's
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
private building codes that we have at
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
the state level we're originally private
 
04:04:08.330 --> 04:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
building codes most of these codes were
 
04:04:11.330 --> 04:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
developed privately and the the private
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
sector doesn't just do a better job of
 
04:04:16.130 --> 04:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
keeping costs down as I've said it does
 
04:04:17.950 --> 04:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
a very good job of keeping quality up
 
04:04:19.849 --> 04:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
once we
 
04:04:22.610 --> 04:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
set things up so that the incentives are
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
in place to favor quality and Longevity
 
04:04:26.689 --> 04:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
and whatnot
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
um so I felt that the study committee
 
04:04:29.630 --> 04:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
was definitely worthwhile because there
 
04:04:31.610 --> 04:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
was a potential for certain
 
04:04:33.290 --> 04:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
professionals deal with life and death
 
04:04:33.300 --> 04:04:35.090 align:start position:0%
professionals deal with life and death
issues

04:04:35.090 --> 04:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:04:37.729 --> 04:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
um and because that was a public safety
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
issue I felt that it was worth opening
 
04:04:40.610 --> 04:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
up this can of worms to see if we could
 
04:04:43.490 --> 04:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
get better quality than just the generic
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
go in take the test meet certain state
 
04:04:48.530 --> 04:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
requirements and then get a piece of
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
paper and in some cases that's that's
 
04:04:53.150 --> 04:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
been a false false sense of security for
 
04:04:55.130 --> 04:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
consumers I think that if they have to
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
carry Insurance in order to do business
 
04:05:01.550 --> 04:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
Architects engineers and so forth that
 
04:05:03.290 --> 04:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
at least the consumer has someone to go
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
back to not just here's a piece of paper
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
that they've taken a test I've done a
 
04:05:08.929 --> 04:05:08.939 align:start position:0%
lot of Occupational licensing over my
 
04:05:10.729 --> 04:05:10.739 align:start position:0%
career but but isn't that just a piece
 
04:05:12.530 --> 04:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
of paper that insurance company said yes
 
04:05:16.130 --> 04:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
they did pay the policy and it's no on a
 
04:05:17.450 --> 04:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
certain date isn't that just a piece of
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
paper because I'm sure that if you got
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
canceled you're not going to hand that
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the person who's asking to show me
 
04:05:25.250 --> 04:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
your proof of insurance
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're not going to hand them a the one
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
that said the letter that says have been
 
04:05:30.590 --> 04:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
canceled you're going to hand them the
 
04:05:33.530 --> 04:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
letter that said I got the policy then
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
that would be fraud claiming so that's
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
another thing that can you you can get
 
04:05:39.469 --> 04:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
recourse through the courts by claiming
 
04:05:41.090 --> 04:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
fraud that they said that they had
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
insurance and they didn't have it's one
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
thing on top of another uh versus if
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's just a state license well you get a
 
04:05:48.590 --> 04:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
state license it carries on for so many
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
years that doesn't necessarily mean that
 
04:05:57.769 --> 04:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's the whole poison they will shut
 
04:06:01.689 --> 04:06:01.699 align:start position:0%
you down
 
04:06:04.610 --> 04:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Bartlett thank
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
um representative Abramson brings up a
 
04:06:09.769 --> 04:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
whole lot of different things when with
 
04:06:11.570 --> 04:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
the examples that he's using ocean
 
04:06:13.490 --> 04:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
marine for one thing is a very different
 
04:06:13.500 --> 04:06:15.290 align:start position:0%
marine for one thing is a very different
product

04:06:15.290 --> 04:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
product
 
04:06:15.300 --> 04:06:16.370 align:start position:0%
product
um

04:06:16.370 --> 04:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:18.590 --> 04:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
the rates that go into an insurance
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
policy are based on the cost of writing
 
04:06:24.889 --> 04:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
the policy and the cost of paying claims
 
04:06:26.150 --> 04:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
and then they're allowed to make a
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
profit because you don't want to write
 
04:06:29.090 --> 04:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
with an insurance company that is not
 
04:06:29.100 --> 04:06:30.110 align:start position:0%
with an insurance company that is not
profitable

04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
profitable
 
04:06:32.689 --> 04:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
if you decided that you wanted the
 
04:06:35.809 --> 04:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
insurance company to do all of the
 
04:06:39.530 --> 04:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
um the qualifications for someone that
 
04:06:41.570 --> 04:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
they're writing as a
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
instead of Licensing you would also
 
04:06:46.370 --> 04:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
increase the cost dramatically for
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
instance boiler Machinery policies you
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
have to have if you have a boiler in
 
04:06:53.689 --> 04:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
your business you have to have a boiler
 
04:06:56.269 --> 04:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
Machinery policy two-thirds of the cost
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
of whether Machinery is just for
 
04:06:58.080 --> 04:06:59.330 align:start position:0%
of whether Machinery is just for
inspections

04:06:59.330 --> 04:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
so that'll start to give you an idea of
 
04:07:03.370 --> 04:07:03.380 align:start position:0%
what goes into those rates
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling like this this discussion is
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
going way further than
 
04:07:13.370 --> 04:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
really necessary but trying to use an
 
04:07:17.210 --> 04:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
insurance policy instead of Licensing
 
04:07:19.250 --> 04:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
um you're you're talking about two
 
04:07:21.530 --> 04:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
different things entirely insurance
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
company can also just you know they can
 
04:07:25.969 --> 04:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
underwrite they can decide whether
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
you're acceptable or not for various
 
04:07:29.330 --> 04:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
reasons maybe they don't write
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
carpenters in this state anymore so
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
if you're a carpenter you're not going
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
to get into policy there's just so much
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
that goes into this that this
 
04:07:44.090 --> 04:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
bill would not meet the needs that we
 
04:07:44.100 --> 04:07:45.010 align:start position:0%
bill would not meet the needs that we
have

04:07:45.010 --> 04:07:45.020 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
eventually say that if we were to pass
 
04:07:49.490 --> 04:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
this any license any license we got rid
 
04:07:52.010 --> 04:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
of any profession we did this the
 
04:07:54.769 --> 04:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
insurance probably will go up in price
 
04:07:58.010 --> 04:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
so you have the the negative effect of
 
04:08:00.410 --> 04:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
actually raising the costs for that
 
04:08:00.420 --> 04:08:03.290 align:start position:0%
actually raising the costs for that
industry

04:08:03.290 --> 04:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Yemen I just had one
 
04:08:07.550 --> 04:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
quick point the uh there is a problem
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
with the bill it requires three members
 
04:08:11.150 --> 04:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
of the Senate to be president and it's
 
04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
hard enough to get one of them to show
 
04:08:16.490 --> 04:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
up to a commission so that's a problem
 
04:08:21.410 --> 04:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
okay you have the last hurray Max so I
 
04:08:23.210 --> 04:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
when I was working as a merchant Mariner
 
04:08:24.530 --> 04:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
I talked to a woman who worked as a
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
nurse and she was I guess two classes
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
away from getting her MD
 
04:08:30.050 --> 04:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
and she told me about the case of a
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
heart surgeon who was licensed
 
04:08:36.130 --> 04:08:36.140 align:start position:0%
um and he had paperwork up the yin yang
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
but he was not competent to work and she
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
noticed that he was being transferred
 
04:08:42.530 --> 04:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
around from hospital to hospital
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
hospital no one would say anything
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
phenomenal reputation everyone said
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful things about him
 
04:08:50.809 --> 04:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
long story short turned out the guy was
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
not only making mistakes at a first-year
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
medical student wouldn't wouldn't make
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
it's operating on the wrong side of the
 
04:08:56.399 --> 04:08:57.889 align:start position:0%
it's operating on the wrong side of the
heart

04:08:57.889 --> 04:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
heart
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
um and made a lot of errors and it was
 
04:09:03.050 --> 04:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
killing some of his patients
 
04:09:05.330 --> 04:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
um she found out that he was a fraud but
 
04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
he had the license he had the paperwork
 
04:09:10.849 --> 04:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
he once he was caught everyone found out
 
04:09:13.370 --> 04:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
it was on the hush hush he went up to
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
his office locked his door and killed
 
04:09:14.880 --> 04:09:15.769 align:start position:0%
his office locked his door and killed
himself

04:09:15.769 --> 04:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
himself
 
04:09:18.050 --> 04:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
they went back through his whole 30-plus
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
year career he'd killed over three he'd
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
killed over 2 000 patients over his
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
career but he had the piece of paper the
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
entire time
 
04:09:29.809 --> 04:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
so the the you know it's one thing for
 
04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
one state agency after another in one
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
hospital after another to just allow it
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
we have doctors in New England
 
04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
who go lose their license in one state
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
and they go to another state my friend
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
Kelly Deo died because she was being
 
04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
over prescribed prescription drugs
 
04:09:47.090 --> 04:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
mostly opioids and other types of things
 
04:09:50.809 --> 04:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
she died licensed doctor he lost his
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire he was now
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
licensed up in Maine piece of paper is a
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
false sense of security that can get
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.929 --> 04:10:05.939 align:start position:0%
that's a credentialing issue with the
 
04:10:08.330 --> 04:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
hospitals they didn't do their job and
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
evidently that's a a hot burner issue
 
04:10:15.889 --> 04:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
you won okay John you can have the
 
04:10:22.130 --> 04:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
lessons thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:10:25.130 --> 04:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
um I get to have the last word
 
04:10:27.469 --> 04:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
everybody knows these these are my
 
04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
binders this is one biennium's worth of
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
bills amendments and notes
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is my third term where I've been in
 
04:10:38.760 --> 04:10:39.889 align:start position:0%
this is my third term where I've been in
Commerce

04:10:39.889 --> 04:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
04:10:42.110 --> 04:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
now you know what my library looks like
 
04:10:44.570 --> 04:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
and mine's as bad as
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
the minority leaders
 
04:10:49.010 --> 04:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's only one year that's only one
