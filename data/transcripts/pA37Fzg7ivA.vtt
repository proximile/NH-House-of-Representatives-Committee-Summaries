a pretty
 
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
a pretty
unobjectionable

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
unobjectionable
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
minor change so
 
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.230 align:start position:0%

okay

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:28.949 align:start position:0%
seeing none
oops

00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
oops
 
00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:29.829 align:start position:0%
oops
oh

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative tripp uh thank
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
you mr chair uh this is
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
one of those bills where uh
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have a law that we have no uh
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
penalty for
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
either ignoring it or disobeying it i
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
guess ignoring and dissipating is
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
probably pretty close to the same thing
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i think that it's a it's an
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
improvement in the law and that uh it
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
adds some a penalty to the
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
failure to
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're back in session we're
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh at senate bill 239 fn
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
the the question that was outstanding
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
we normally deal with house bills and
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
this is these are senate bills today and
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
the question was putting
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
bills like this on the consent calendar
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
now the answer is yes and no
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
yes we can put senate bills on
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
consent calendar but this particular
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
bill we can't because it has an n next
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
to it and it means it has to go to
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
finance first to be reviewed
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
so uh we don't need a motion to put it
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
on consent
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
all right next bill is uh senate bill
 
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:52.829 align:start position:0%
all right next bill is uh senate bill
235.

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
235.
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%

ask you a minute to make make that
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
motion to accept the amendment
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
i believe representative guthrie just
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
made it so um i'll i'd like to second
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh and if i may speak to
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
the motivation
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes you can stick to your motion
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
reason for changing trash to waste is
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
pretty simple i just want to make sure
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
that compost and recycling are covered
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
regular trash so i thought that waste
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
was the broader term that
 
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
was the broader term that
would

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
include all of those
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
municipality and uh people living there
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
then it should be dealt with
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
within the municipality and not
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
something that uh should be studied to
 
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.310 align:start position:0%
something that uh should be studied to
determine

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
you know how we could better
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh resolve these issues
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know if it's if it's an issue that
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
was created locally then it should be
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
solved locally and this is why i made my
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
itl motion
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion on
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh the motion hasn't met as amended mr
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
chair yes
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
disagree with the itl this is yes it's a
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
local issue
 
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:10.460 align:start position:0%
but there's no
 
00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.110 align:start position:0%
but there's no
[Music]

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
property tax is not just local it also
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
is a state
 
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.510 align:start position:0%
is a state
and

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.549 align:start position:0%
and
since

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
this is a study
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
to look at there are some
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
consistencies inconsistencies across
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
so to look at there's it's not an
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it's not changing
 
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it's not changing
anything

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
and we have dealt with uh other issues
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
where waste management and the state is
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
looking at and
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
you know we have discussed we have other
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
bills that has looked at this and it's
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
an issue and it's uh not just the
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
statewide it is the trash removal
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
and uh the municipal waste
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
disposal and uh how we deal with it is
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
an issue that was faced with every
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
municipality every state and nationwide
 
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.590 align:start position:0%
municipality every state and nationwide
and

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
if we just look at the other say and say
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
this is not our problem
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
i disagree with that and so i would not
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
be supporting itl
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative please
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um mr chairman and uh
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
when i wasn't here when the when the
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
public hearing happened but the the more
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
i've talked to people in the
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
understanding i have i believe that
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
between the municipalities and um the
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
condo associations and people in in
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
general there seems to be some kind of
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
confusion as to the fees and where they
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
go and so on and um i think that's what
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
could help warrant a study
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
while i agree with my uh my colleague
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
that um sometimes the state and
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities kind of conflict and we
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
need to let the municipalities make the
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
decision i think this study would just
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
kind of help with some recommendations
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
and might help guide the municipalities
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
a little bit better so um that's why i
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
was for it so thank you thank you any
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative guthrie yeah thank
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i understand that
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions and
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
i just it's just another one but i think
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's the one that's worthwhile as
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the uh the bill i i feel
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh something we
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
the condominium and renters need uh help
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
in uh uh taking a look at this problem
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
so i will vote against the itl
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other comments
 
00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:41.909 align:start position:0%

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative perez
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
speak up i agree that we have a lot of
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
study committees going on um in the
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
environmental and agricultural committee
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
but this is
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
one that i i believe this is going to
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
work this is going to help us to
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
continue this study that we're really
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
doing with
 
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.110 align:start position:0%
doing with
the

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
other committees so i believe that uh
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
that the itl i will not support because
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%

and i wasn't here when you folks debated
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
this bill but it looks to me as though
 
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
this bill but it looks to me as though
it

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
just wants to insert the state into an
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
agreement that a developer makes in on
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
condominium owners and it seems to me
 
00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:42.070 align:start position:0%
condominium owners and it seems to me
that

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%

that should stay
a

a
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
an agreement between

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.350 align:start position:0%

00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think the state should be
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
involved in this so i will vote
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass motion
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives davis
 
00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives davis
um

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes i would um agree with my colleague
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh where not for the fact that trash
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
pickup fees are tacked onto state
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
property tax bills local and state
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
property tax bills and so it very much
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
is a state matter in my view and so i
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
will be voting to
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
support the ought to pass as amended i
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of confusion around
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
private communities whether they be
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations condominium
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
associations or other types of
 
00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.669 align:start position:0%
associations or other types of
developments

00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
developments
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
as to who pays for what but everyone
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of who pays for what pays
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
any other discussion yes representative
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
manchapudi thank you mr chair
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
considering that we are in a
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
housing crisis um
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
across the state and every municipality
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
every community is trying to create
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
a housing opportunity for people to live
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
work and
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
raise the family
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
this will help because there is a rush
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
to create a lot of much needed housing
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
and if we have you know this is more
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
recent and the inconsistency yes
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
oh set your point of order does the bill
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
has to do with condominiums and their
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
i am coming to it condominiums and their
 
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.190 align:start position:0%
i am coming to it condominiums and their
uh

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
fees and homeowner associations
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
not uh additional housing to be built
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
no i am coming to it i've already been
 
00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:46.070 align:start position:0%
no i am coming to it i've already been
built

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment may continue yeah thank
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
you mr chair i'm coming to it because it
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
is between the developer and the zoning
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
of each community and that is where the
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies are
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
and the new constructions are paying the
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
taxes but not having the
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
trash pick up that is the clarification
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's needed so that's why i think this
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
is very needed
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
much needed in time
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
and i would be supporting
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
oh you already
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh we already went to you yes sir
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind the committee this
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
is just to set up a committee
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
to look at this
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
i found the testimony of the gentleman
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
the retired the man that was retired
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
that moved into a condominium
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
community very compelling
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
he's denied municipal services that he's
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
um that are that are given to other
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
condominium owners and other residents
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
of his community i think that at least
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
looking at this examining it see how how
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
widespread it is i think is
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
is doing these uh granite staters a
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
service i think we owe it to at least
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
have it looked at thank you
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any other
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
conversation yes representative davis
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chair i realized i did have a
 
00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:20.470 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chair i realized i did have a
comment

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
comment
um

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
in my community in lebanon we have
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
recently approved or in the process of
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
approving approximately
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
2500 new units of housing
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
state law is silent
 
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.669 align:start position:0%
state law is silent
on

00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
what the arrangements are going to be to
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
remove trash from 2000 new units of
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
housing that's a lot of trash that's a
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think it would be beneficial for
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state certainly would be
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial for my constituents to have a
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
study committee that looks at this issue
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
because it's not just who pays issue
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's a sanitation and a
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'm still a little dumbfounded in that
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
the the need for this
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
because if all that is permitted to
 
00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:28.389 align:start position:0%
because if all that is permitted to
study

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:30.310 align:start position:0%
study
is

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
agreements between developers and
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities on municipal trash
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
removal fees
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're using a
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
nuclear weapon to destroy
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
you know an ant hill
 
00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
you know an ant hill
uh

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
once again
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
this is something that
 
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.110 align:start position:0%
this is something that
uh

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.630 align:start position:0%
uh
condominiums

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
condominiums
 
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.549 align:start position:0%
condominiums
owners

00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
owners
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
or condominium associations are
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
a rather unique animal in in the state
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
uh

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
if if they were to have an agreement
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
within with the municipality
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
how trash pickup is going to be
 
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.669 align:start position:0%
how trash pickup is going to be
performed

00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
performed
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
i would think that uh once again if if
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
if it was done
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
relatively early in the formation of the
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
the condo association
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know to
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
keep costs down
 
00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:28.710 align:start position:0%
keep costs down
uh

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
or whatever if there was a reason for it
 
00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
or whatever if there was a reason for it
then

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
if later on people find out that no
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're not getting a service but we're
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
paying for it this is something that
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
once again the municipal association the
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
condo association and municipality
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
should revisit the agreement you know
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
i i find it amazing that the state is
 
00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:54.470 align:start position:0%
i i find it amazing that the state is
getting

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
involved in something as miniscule as
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
where the trash goes as some of the
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee you know
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is an issue
 
00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is an issue
that's

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be discussed in this
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee because it's limited to
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh agreements between the condo
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
associations and the uh
 
00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:17.909 align:start position:0%
associations and the uh
municipalities

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
if someone wants to amend
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
the bill to give it a little more reach
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
and range
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
then i would probably support it but
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
right now the
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
the study committee it's limited
 
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:35.270 align:start position:0%
the study committee it's limited
by

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
the the reason it's
 
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.349 align:start position:0%
the the reason it's
established

00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about municipal trash removal
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:45.109 align:start position:0%
you know
it's

00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
once again it's it's
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
a i i don't believe there's any merit to
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
the bill thank you
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative davis
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
gilman i'm gilmar i'm sorry
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i i understand uh
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
the reluctance and i keep hearing the
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
state shouldn't get involved but this is
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
not getting involved this is a committee
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
to study
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
not just um
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
what happens between a municipality and
 
00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:16.870 align:start position:0%
what happens between a municipality and
a

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
condo or homeowners association but it
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
says examine
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
issues and issues are where does the
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
trash go how does the town pay for it
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
how do the condominium owners pay for it
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
every town has some form perhaps of a
 
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.990 align:start position:0%
every town has some form perhaps of a
different

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
agreement and i think the study
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee would establish
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:44.780 align:start position:0%
again because we have landfill
 
00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.589 align:start position:0%
again because we have landfill
[Music]

00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
problems i mean citing landfills are
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get close them down that
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
affects what the towns do
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
with their costs and what the taxpayers
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
pay and i understand condominium payers
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
are paying for something they don't get
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
but that's a that's a choice that the
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
and this i think the committee
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
needs to look at because we have laws
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
regarding condominium associations this
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that we might want
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
to look at and recommend adding
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
verbiage about that into condominium
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
association agreements
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
so as a study committee you know it's
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
not enabling it's just going to come up
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
with recommendations
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you any further
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um it's clear that
 
00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:38.829 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um it's clear that
these

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
agreements between the developers and
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
the municipalities were made at the
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
local level therefore if there are any
 
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:50.310 align:start position:0%
local level therefore if there are any
um

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
if there's any unhappiness or
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
the people in the hoa do not
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
like the agreement
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
at this point in time then in my mind
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
this should be
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
dealt with at the local level the state
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
did not get involved in these agreements
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding and therefore they
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
the state should not
 
00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:12.790 align:start position:0%
the state should not
be

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
be studying this it's a local issue
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
it it is derived at the local level and
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
therefore should be
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay in further discussion on the bill
 
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.910 align:start position:0%
okay in further discussion on the bill
yes

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.950 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
so

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
i heard um
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
one of the representatives say that
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
we're not getting involved in this it's
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
just a study committee well if we're not
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
getting involved and why study it
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
i concur that this is a local agreement
 
00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:48.630 align:start position:0%
i concur that this is a local agreement
and

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
it should be something dealt with at the
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
local level with the governing board of
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
whatever that town of municipality is
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
um in regard to landfills uh closing
 
00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.430 align:start position:0%
um in regard to landfills uh closing
that's

00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
that is a fact that they're closing in
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
many places but if you're gonna if
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to study it then you should
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
study the whole thing
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that affects
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
not just
 
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.630 align:start position:0%
not just
condominium

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
condominium
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
owners and renters but it affects
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
everybody potentially at the local level
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
but again the governing boards of these
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities ultimately decide
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
who they're going to contract with the
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
dude trash pick up some municipalities
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
don't even have that it's up to the end
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
individual property owner to take care
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
of that on a private contract so i just
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
think we're getting involved in
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
something that um we shouldn't be
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
getting involved in
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tripp
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
it seems that we're getting a little
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
scope creep here
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
agreements between municipalities and uh
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
condo associations and and now i find
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna be talking about
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
landfills and uh how to deal with trash
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh are we going to be talking about
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
the type of vehicles that are used to
 
00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:06.470 align:start position:0%
the type of vehicles that are used to
remove

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
the the trash
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
is is this a effort to
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
get electric vehicles involved you know
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
the bill is for
 
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.829 align:start position:0%
the bill is for
is

00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
being grown
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
to where
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know it yes it does become a state
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
issue if you if you
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
investigate all these issues but once
 
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.430 align:start position:0%
investigate all these issues but once
again

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.790 align:start position:0%
again
the

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is to investigate
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
or study
 
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.550 align:start position:0%
or study
uh

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%

making a mountain out of a mohil issue
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
manchipuri thank you mr chair i want to
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
bring everybody's attention back to what
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is committee to establish there
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
is an established committee to study
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
agreements between developers and
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities on municipal trash
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
removal fee paid by the condominium
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
owners and renters
 
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.990 align:start position:0%
owners and renters
period

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
so the amendment just changes the trash
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
removal to solid waste which encompasses
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
nobody's talking about the reason we are
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
using the word landfill or the
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistency because the
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies were brought from one
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
community and i am one of the
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors because i got some uh
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%

thank you uh
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
there are inconsistency in my own
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
community that the constituents brought
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
to my attention and i would just not
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor something which i didn't think
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
it existed in my community and so it is
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
to study the inconsistency and solid
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
waste and trash is a big issue in every
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
community and we need to have some
 
00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:39.030 align:start position:0%
community and we need to have some
consistent

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
answers and it's a very short
 
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.950 align:start position:0%
answers and it's a very short
focused

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
focused
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why i urge my colleagues to
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%

00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
yes representatives davis
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair i
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
cannot agree with an itl on this bill
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
because as in a previous bill
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
present and growing issue in our state
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
with so-called private qualified private
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
communities whether they be condominium
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
associations garden apartment
 
00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:37.829 align:start position:0%
associations garden apartment
developments

00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
developments
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations or the like
 
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.790 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations or the like
where

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
developers make agreements with local
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
planning boards that have
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
vast implications
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
for the future residents or owners of
 
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.390 align:start position:0%
for the future residents or owners of
those

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
it is sometimes said let the buyer
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
beware you know what you're getting into
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
when you buy into one of these
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
communities but sometimes you don't
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
and more often than not
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
that sometimes is
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
55 pages of legal
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
arguments in the homeowners association
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
documents that no reasonable person
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
could understand
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
and so they get saddled with costs that
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
they do not expect to pay
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
costs that their neighbors who live on
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
public streets do not pay because no
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
developer was involved and no agreement
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
was made
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think that there was a basic issue of
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
fairness here
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
the once
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
and if the argument is made well then
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
just go back to the planning board and
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
undo it that can't be done
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
under current statute that can't be done
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of homeowners associations our
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
state doesn't even have any law
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
that provides guidelines to homeowners
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
associations only condominiums so we
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
have a plethora of growing types of
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
housing that's considered private
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
housing on private roads
 
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.349 align:start position:0%
housing on private roads
where

00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%

unsuspecting citizens are getting roped
into

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
deals that they will not be able to
 
00:46:17.359 --> 00:46:18.390 align:start position:0%
deals that they will not be able to
afford

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
afford
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
because the municipalities will not pay
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
for essential services such as road
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
repair and things like that and i think
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
that this is a
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
major issue that is only going to become
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
more major
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
as more housing units get developed
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
and i think it deserves a study
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
any further discussion yes
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative manjuputi thank you mr
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
chair i couldn't uh second or
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
amplify my colleague who made a comment
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
just now this is i was surprised at how
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
many people
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
testified in support and how many miles
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
of private roads are in
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
one for example just laconia has over 30
 
00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.829 align:start position:0%
one for example just laconia has over 30
communities

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
that have private roads so
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
if they're coming for a clarification
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
and this is you know instead of itling
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
make another motion to show we have
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
heard that isn't that our role as us
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
look at what issues we have in different
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
communities i'm not saying we have to
 
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.309 align:start position:0%
communities i'm not saying we have to
make

00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
rules for every community overarching
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
but at least if the concerns are brought
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
isn't that our duty as state
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
legislators to look at and study it and
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
not show uh
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
put it
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
aside as itl thank you mr klee
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
committee members for hearing me out um
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
again i i was not here for the the
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing but i i did do some
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
homework as well as listen to that and
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i spoke to um
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
our community development people in in
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
nashua and one of the things that i'm
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more um is that we're
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
getting these these community type of
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
builds in our municipalities because
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
space is smaller and smaller and when we
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
we have these type of condominiums and
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
so on these roads do become
 
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.630 align:start position:0%
so on these roads do become
private

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
when i first moved to new hampshire i
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
lived in a condominium type of thing and
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things was that it wasn't
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
that old of a condominium and soon the
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
roads started kind of breaking down and
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
we actually had sinkholes we had this
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
and suddenly there were these
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
monumentous kind of assessments that
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
were put on all of the owners
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
um we could pay them over five years but
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
if we sold the place we were still
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for it and so on it really
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
became a burden
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
and the sad thing was it also happened
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
just as the market crashed so the values
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
of our homes went down and suddenly we
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
had this if there had been some type of
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
an escrow
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
where money was put to place that could
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
have taken care of that that would have
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
been less of a burden and we might not
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
have had as many people running away
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
from their their homes i think a study
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
is a good thing and i'm gonna preface
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
this with this is the second time i'm
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
now here voting for a study and i don't
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
usually like too many studies because i
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
think they go nowhere
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
but i think this might be one of those
 
00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.109 align:start position:0%
but i think this might be one of those
that

00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to kind of give some
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
ideas i don't think it's necessarily
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
going to come out and say
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
you have to do this you have to do that
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
but it might find some polls some ways
 
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.670 align:start position:0%
but it might find some polls some ways
of

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
working these contracts a little bit
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
better um and so on and you know as an
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
alderman i hate putting any burden on
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
the municipality but i do think that um
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
having some type of um
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
of study or or even you know if we could
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
move this past itl and get to a study
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for kind of mixing
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
things up here um i i think might be a
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
good idea so for that reason i cannot
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
vote for an ital on this so thank you
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
uh

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
since we're talking about reasonable
 
00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:07.349 align:start position:0%
since we're talking about reasonable
persons

00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:50:07.359 --> 00:50:09.030 align:start position:0%
persons
uh

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that uh
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
a reasonable person
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat skeptical about the lower cost
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
of a condominium
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
independent house
 
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.589 align:start position:0%
independent house
if

00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
if i was to
 
00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:30.470 align:start position:0%
if i was to
uh

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
be looking at the cost of
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
building a buying a residence and i was
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
to find out that oh a condominium it's
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know forty thousand dollars cheaper
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
than buying a house on uh
 
00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.230 align:start position:0%
than buying a house on uh
uh

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh in in the town
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
i would be wondering
 
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.589 align:start position:0%
i would be wondering
why

00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's so much cheaper
 
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.950 align:start position:0%
it's so much cheaper
and

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know yes the condominium agreements
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
are rather lengthy uh
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
55 pages is probably skimpy you know but
 
00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:02.710 align:start position:0%
55 pages is probably skimpy you know but
uh

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
the reason they're long is because the
 
00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:07.030 align:start position:0%
the reason they're long is because the
law

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.670 align:start position:0%
the current law
uh

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mandate that the uh uh
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
agreements be so long but uh you know
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
from a legal perspective the developers
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
know that uh
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
they have to disclose uh
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they're not good
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
at disclosing is future costs and
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
conditions and i agree that this might
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
be a solution
 
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.589 align:start position:0%
be a solution
to

00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
something like this because
 
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.309 align:start position:0%
something like this because
uh

00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
uh
it

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
it would let the people know that
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you're having to establish an escrow
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
account like this bill does
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
that there's a reason the reason is the
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
roads are not built to uh
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
proper standards and that you're going
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
to have to be
 
00:51:55.839 --> 00:51:56.630 align:start position:0%
to have to be
uh

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
paying money
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
to to uh
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh fix them
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
and and yes you will be getting you know
 
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.549 align:start position:0%
and and yes you will be getting you know
large

00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners or condo assessments because
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
you're reaping the harvest of what
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
you've sown
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know if if you
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
don't understand that
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
discounted property
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
as it's it's risk
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know then
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to end up like this
 
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.790 align:start position:0%
you're going to end up like this
this

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.109 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
this is a solution
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's a band-aid more than a uh
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
than a fix
 
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.309 align:start position:0%
than a fix
because

00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:41.190 align:start position:0%
because
uh

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
you you're requiring the developer to
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
establish an escrow account and guess
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
what that's going to do it's going to
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
raise the cost of the
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
of the condos
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.599 --> 00:52:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
10

00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
years down the road it's going to happen
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
again now this is not a solution it's a
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
band-aid you know if people
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't understand what they're getting
 
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.790 align:start position:0%
don't understand what they're getting
into

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's too bad and my in my opinion
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
and this is why i support the itil
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
 
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.790 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
so

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to um clarify a bit with
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
people talking about
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
studying where that's coming from so the
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill itself is not a study committee the
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
bill actually does stuff
 
00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:35.190 align:start position:0%
bill actually does stuff
it

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.349 align:start position:0%
it
defines

00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
defines
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh qualified private communities
 
00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.270 align:start position:0%
uh qualified private communities
and

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
put some regulations on them
 
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.950 align:start position:0%
put some regulations on them
so

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
where this where the studying is coming
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
from is if
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
the itl motion fails
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
the studying would come from a motion to
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
interim study this bill it wouldn't it
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be from
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
trying to pass it
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
i think we agree
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
that this bill needs some work we're
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
just differing on how exactly we want to
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
do that work
 
00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:12.870 align:start position:0%
do that work
davis

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
davis
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna take that band-aid i really
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
need that band-aid
 
00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.790 align:start position:0%
need that band-aid
because

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
my homeowners association levied four
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
special assessments last year
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
because the road that our homes are
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
built on and by the way our homes are
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
way more expensive
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
than many single-family homes elsewhere
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
in our community so that so the the
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
fiction the condominiums or homes on
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
private roads are
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
de facto less expensive than other homes
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
is a fiction
 
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.829 align:start position:0%
is a fiction
um

00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
the city will not repair our
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
roads in order for the city to repair
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
our roads it would have to go through a
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
lengthy municipal process legal process
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
to accept the roads as public roads
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
which it will not do because it would
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
cost the city money to do that this is
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
an issue that is a statewide issue that
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be studied and the and the
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
if some people don't know what they're
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
getting into that's too bad
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
well you could say that about a lot of
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
things and it would kind of be a little
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
sketchy i think
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
so just to put it right out there it is
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
a fiction
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
that condominiums and homes and
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations are somehow less
 
00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.430 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations are somehow less
expensive

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore you have to you should
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
expect to spend more on their upkeep
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
that's not true
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere in our state
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
and number two
 
00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.750 align:start position:0%
and number two
i

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
heartily agree with my colleague that
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is not a study bill this is a
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
bill that proposes legislation
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
i will support the itl on this bill if
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
we can make a subsequent
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
a private road
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
is nothing more than a shared driveway
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
the same things
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
in a condo association that you pay for
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
to maintain your parking lot
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
is the same as maintaining that road
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
when you buy a home or a condo on a
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
private road
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
all that road is is shared by everybody
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
on that road
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
everybody pays in to plow it
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
everybody pays in to maintain it
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
and to have the state step in
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
basically a developer will just build a
 
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.309 align:start position:0%
basically a developer will just build a
road

00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
that's a town road
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
then you'll get it plowed but you'll pay
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
a lot more money for your house you'll
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
pay a lot more money for your taxes
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
if your house was expensive then that
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
was what the market called for
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh i know where i live
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of the roads are private
 
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.109 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of the roads are private
roads

00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
roads
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
they pay less in taxes
 
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.549 align:start position:0%
they pay less in taxes
than

00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
than we do that live on town roads
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
so basically
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know to have a contractor
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
put aside
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
like i heard a number fifty thousand
 
00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:23.510 align:start position:0%
like i heard a number fifty thousand
dollars

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know say you fix that road
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
and five years from now you've got to
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
fix it again does he have to come back
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
and give you another 50 000
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's the question i have
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why i think we should i tell
 
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.510 align:start position:0%
and that's why i think we should i tell
it

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.190 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
clay

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
clay
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me a second bite
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
at this apple i don't disagree with my
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
my colleagues
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the fact that
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
this bill as written does need some work
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
but i think it also has as as what uh
 
00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
like my colleague
 
00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.270 align:start position:0%
like my colleague
there

00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
had pointed out it does have some merits
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
and it does have some place to go
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
those in condo associations
 
00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:08.470 align:start position:0%
those in condo associations
we

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
do have lengthy and i no longer live in
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
one of those but there there are lengthy
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
roads when they purchase these these
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
places they don't think oh these are our
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
private roads or these or that um i
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
still think that they're reasonably
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
minded people
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that they quite grasp
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
that whole concept of it and as i
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
pointed out having
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
having this this sudden
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
one right after another and and those
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
aren't the only things that you that you
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
get assessments on without without
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
realizing it you have roofs you have
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
decks you have all these type of things
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason why in some cases that
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
they are cheaper is because you don't
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily own the land the group
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
itself the association owns and lands
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
and that's what your fees are for and
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
your fees are for any amenities that you
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
have i think even reasonable people
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
don't realize that their roads
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
are not quite the same built wise as
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
town roads are
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
they they don't have as quite a life as
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
the town roads have and
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
while i i agree you know fifty thousand
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
dollars or whatever the number is that
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to put in there that needs
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
to be looked at and it needs to be who's
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to be have ownership of that
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
escrow account and does it just get
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
established by the
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
developer and then the association has
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
to continue with one and and so on i
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
just think it's a good idea to look into
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
this and as was pointed out this is not
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
an interim study bill this isn't a a
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
pass or fail bill but i think um
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
if we move past the itl and we could get
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
to an interim study that would be
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
better serving the people so thank you
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i want to agree
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
with my colleague from nashua
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not supportive of the itl i support
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
interim study and it's for a reason that
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
hasn't been brought up today but it was
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
brought up in the public hearing and
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's the fact that these public roads
 
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.270 align:start position:0%
that's the fact that these public roads
impact

00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
a lot more people than the people that
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
are using them
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
because private roads not being built to
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
any type of state or local standard
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
are one of the biggest reasons that we
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
are seeing pollution in watersheds
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
the uncontrolled runoff from public road
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
from private roads which we don't really
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
see as much with with public roads
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
affects everybody that lives in a
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
watershed and what we've been seeing the
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
last few years in new hampshire and it's
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's we're going to see it more this
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
year is the growth of cyanobacteria
 
01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:31.990 align:start position:0%
year is the growth of cyanobacteria
blooms

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
blooms
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
i'm involved with a watershed management
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
study in moultonborough and what we're
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
seeing is that a lot of private roads
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
that are built in a watershed have
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled runoff and so the damage of
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
these private roads goes far beyond the
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
multiple communities that are suffering
 
01:00:52.559 --> 01:00:54.390 align:start position:0%
multiple communities that are suffering
from

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
contamination in their waterways in
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
particular their lakes thank you
 
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.990 align:start position:0%
particular their lakes thank you
yes

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you this is actually a procedural
 
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.950 align:start position:0%
thank you this is actually a procedural
question

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
if we wish to get to interim study we
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
have to defeat
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
the itl motion is that correct
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
we're hearing that this
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
this many problems with the bill
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
and so if we itl the bill saying how
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's the second year of the uh term
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
somebody can bring back up hopefully a
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
better bill if this is what you want to
 
01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:34.549 align:start position:0%
better bill if this is what you want to
do

01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:35.670 align:start position:0%
do
but

01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
what concerns me is that
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
these private communities
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
the word private with private roads
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
people have moved into these
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
with an agreement
 
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.270 align:start position:0%
with an agreement
knowing

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
the at least they should certainly know
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
if they've read their agreement that
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
it's a private road to private uh
 
01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.349 align:start position:0%
it's a private road to private uh
community

01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
now if you don't like the deal you want
 
01:01:59.359 --> 01:02:00.150 align:start position:0%
now if you don't like the deal you want
to

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
have the state intervene and change the
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
deal for you it's it's totally
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
inappropriate if this is comes down to a
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
zoning issue then again that's done at
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
the local level if
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
you don't like the way it was zoned then
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
you work through your local zoning
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
boards i support the itale and i hope we
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
move on to that uh call them a
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
there is a fire code that says how wide
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
the road has to be
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
the road has to be 30 feet wide so fire
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
trucks can pass each other on that road
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
so there is standards on these roads in
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
and the planning board makes those
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
decisions with the developer but he does
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
have to follow those codes
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
i've heard several times that uh there's
 
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.990 align:start position:0%
i've heard several times that uh there's
a

01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
a wastewater issue
 
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.430 align:start position:0%
a wastewater issue
uh

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
with the private roads
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i i find this
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
to be once again a
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
a state problem and that
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
i would believe that
 
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.750 align:start position:0%
i would believe that
when

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
a development even the development that
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
has private roads
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
it has to go before the planning board
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i believe the planning board you
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
know at least when i was on the planning
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
board one of the the things that we
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
looked at was
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
what are they going to do with the
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
wastewater that runs off the roofs that
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
runs off the roads that runs off of any
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
other impervious
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh surface
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh irene in fact as i remember
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
when the developer couldn't answer that
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
question that we
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
killed the development
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
this is interesting that this is brought
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
up as a problem but this is once again a
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
local problem that the planning board
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
should deal with you know if they're not
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
doing it then they should you should
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
have a better planning board not a law
 
01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.430 align:start position:0%
have a better planning board not a law
that

01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.549 align:start position:0%
that
mandates

01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
well they actually already have a law
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
that mandates that wastewater has to be
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
why uh
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
this this is all of a sudden an issue
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative guthrie yes
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
just a comment i think one of the
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
going down this road is first that the
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
developer would pass on his costs
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
to the buyers
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh in the first place and then in the
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
second place we have a real serious
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
housing problem in new hampshire nobody
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
denies that
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that this
 
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.270 align:start position:0%
and i think that this
would

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
increase because it would increase the
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
cost to the developer it might slow down
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
our attempts
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
and the governor's attempts particularly
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
i think we've all read recently the
 
01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:02.069 align:start position:0%
i think we've all read recently the
governor's

01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
desire to use state i mean in federal
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
funds in order to support the uh
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
developer side of the
 
01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:12.950 align:start position:0%
developer side of the
uh

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
equation for solving the passing problem
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i i agree with the itl
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to be
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
doing anything everything we can to help
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
our developers
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh and on the building side to decrease
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing and to
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
availability of housing and i think the
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of this bill is
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
it would have an impact on that
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
so i would be voting in favor of itl
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh further
 
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh further
discussion

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative perez thank you i i
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
agree with my colleague
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
that yes we have a housing crisis but we
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
do have a water contamination crisis as
 
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.630 align:start position:0%
do have a water contamination crisis as
well

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
we need to protect both of them and and
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
this is something that that you know is
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
critical and uh for that reason i will
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
not support the itl motion
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
thank you

and we will soon take a vote on it so i
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%

and it's been second
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
represented

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
motion's been made and seconded i'll ask
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
now for discussion any discussion your
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
um so i remember
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
hearing discussion that there might
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
possibly be a second amendment
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
drafted to this bill to address things
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
such as
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
cops conditional use
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
um i forgot what the ps4
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
permits and um
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then also residency requirements um
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
did that turn out not to get drafted
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
after all
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
or um
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
does um
 
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.430 align:start position:0%
does um
or

01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i believe representative maggiore was
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
going to um
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
have that drafted but since he's not
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
here i guess it looks like
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
representatives davis can answer
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
representatives davis
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
i'll try
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
there is no amendment that i know of
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
there was discussion about a potential
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
amendment but nothing has been drafted
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
by ols and nothing has been distributed
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tripp
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
uh

01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.830 align:start position:0%
uh
you

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
might have noticed i didn't make an itl
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
motion that's because
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh i think this bill has merit
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh but i don't think it's ready for
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
prime time
 
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.709 align:start position:0%
prime time
uh

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
the idea of sprinkling
 
01:13:39.679 --> 01:13:41.189 align:start position:0%
the idea of sprinkling
uh

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
b and b's or and and whatever
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
is uh in in residential
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh residentially zoned areas in in towns
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
not a good idea in my mind because uh
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
you have people that
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
are have have established homes
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
and and have certain expectations of of
 
01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.189 align:start position:0%
and and have certain expectations of of
uh

01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
how the uh
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
area is going to be
 
01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
area is going to be
uh

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be uh
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
noisy with people partying
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be you know an
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
overload of cars due to the the the
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
rentals the short-term rentals uh
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's something that uh
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
i think would be an annoyance to me if
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
if if there was uh i think
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
comments in the uh
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
testimony was that uh
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
there was a bus showed up from harvard
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
with 30 people in a six bedroom house
 
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
i i doubt that that would
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh meet the requirements of the fire
 
01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
uh meet the requirements of the fire
code

01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many cars were there
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
but i doubt that would meet the parking
 
01:15:02.719 --> 01:15:04.390 align:start position:0%
but i doubt that would meet the parking
ordinance

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of things that need
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
to be considered
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
in the implementation of short-term
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
rentals in uh
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
the towns here in
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
i understand that it's a uh
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
economically it's it's quite a boost
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
to have short-term rentals because it
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
brings people into the towns
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
they spend their money and then they go
 
01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.630 align:start position:0%
they spend their money and then they go
home

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.750 align:start position:0%
home
so

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done is spend a little
 
01:15:37.679 --> 01:15:38.950 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done is spend a little
time

01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.870 align:start position:0%
time
uh

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that were brought up
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
so uh and that's why i uh
 
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.709 align:start position:0%
so uh and that's why i uh
support

01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
the interim study motion
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative clay
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and my
 
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.189 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and my
colleagues

01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:16:03.199 --> 01:16:04.630 align:start position:0%
colleagues
um

01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
i i truly find so many holes in this one
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
um that it it disturbs me um i agree we
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
the the monies that would be brought in
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
from people spending and then leaving
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
um is is incredible and i'm sure that
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
there's some towns in some cities that
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
even would like that but
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take from what a previous
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
um one of my colleagues here said at the
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
at the last um
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
comment about whether or not like an
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
interim study would have been
 
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.310 align:start position:0%
interim study would have been
appropriate

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
this is the second year and this does
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
have a lot of issues with it and to put
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
an interim study together to try to fix
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
all that's wrong with this
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
um i think is is a big ask and as this
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
is the the last year of this um
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
this session so to speak perhaps it
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
would be best for someone who um is
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
truly interested in this to bring it
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
forward with maybe some of those fixes
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
rather than the state and this body
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
having to try to put those those fixes
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
through for them
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
i do feel that it once again would be
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the um
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
the municipalities putting a you will do
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
this type of thing and that always
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
bothers me when we're mandating our our
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
towns and our in our cities to do
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
something like this so for this reason
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
um i cannot
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
i cannot support an interim study and i
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
would like to see that go down and so we
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
could bring in itl thank you
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative stavis
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh and i agree with all of my colleagues
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
for three major reasons
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
and the first maybe is who picks up the
 
01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.700 align:start position:0%
and the first maybe is who picks up the
trash

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:52.710 align:start position:0%
trash
 
01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
trash
[Laughter]

01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you who picks up the waste
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
and the runoff
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
so in our last conversation we we took a
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
lot of time debating about local control
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
and how the state should not meddle in
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
local affairs and this bill is nothing
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
but a big meddling in local affairs it's
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
telling towns and cities that they can't
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
do something even if it's in the best
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
interest of that town or city to do
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
something and that is not something that
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
we do here in new hampshire
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
and number three i would just like to
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
call everyone's attention to an incident
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
that took place yesterday
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
last night i believe
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
in pittsburgh and it's true pittsburgh
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
is not new hampshire although we do have
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
a pittsburgh in new hampshire
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
where two people were
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
shot to death
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
several people were wounded
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
in an airbnb that was set up for
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know three or four people and
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
roughly 200 people at a party there
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
and the response by airbnb after the
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
after the fact
 
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
was they're going to ban this host from
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
their platform forever
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
well that's not going to bring those two
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
dead people back
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i say let's look at this further
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
let's look at the holes in the bill that
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
my colleague raised and let's think
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
about what local towns and cities should
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
be able to do to protect their citizens
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wrong
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
first off i agree with my colleague from
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
lebanon that and we've had a lot of
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
discussion today about the
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
role of municipalities and that they
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
should have some say in their
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
communities and what they approve or
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
disapprove so
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
um i i'm against this bill because i i
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
believe it infringes on
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
the decisions that municipalities should
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
have for local control
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
as far as the interim study goes
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support interim study
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
because i'll only vote for interim study
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
if i want to give up some of my summer
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
to serve on that committee and i'm not
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
willing to for this bill thank you
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
i agree with the many of the comments my
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues have made
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
and if
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
anything my email looked like
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
my inbox was filled with
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
and you know at a point where i couldn't
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
get any more emails it was
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
until i cleared all the emails
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
so if there's such a concern in terms of
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
the short-term rental and taking away
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
local control and keeping the public
 
01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.470 align:start position:0%
local control and keeping the public
safety

01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
in mind i want to make sure
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
my community and my constituents are
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
safe and my municipalities able to
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
support that
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
and at the same time support the tourism
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
and economic development it goes hand in
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
hand so
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
from that i cannot
 
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.229 align:start position:0%
from that i cannot
support

01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
you know this needs to be itled
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
and i cannot support the income starting
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
is it further discussion yes
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:34.709 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
so

01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to echo comments that previous
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues have made
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
about the problems with this bill um
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
so and i i support the motion to put it
 
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.270 align:start position:0%
so and i i support the motion to put it
to

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
interim study because i do think that
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
passing some sort of legislation about
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
airbnbs or vrbos or whatever other
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
short-term rental platforms there are
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
are worthwhile um a lot of people i know
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
use them i used one myself when going
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
out to visit my brother in oregon last
 
01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.669 align:start position:0%
out to visit my brother in oregon last
fall

01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:22:07.679 --> 01:22:08.629 align:start position:0%
fall
um

01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
but yeah there are things that need to
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
be worked on like the uh
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
the conditional use permits and the
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
residency requirements and one other
 
01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.310 align:start position:0%
residency requirements and one other
issue

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
i remembered that might be worth it
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
worth looking at is um
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
whether there's
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
racial profiling
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
going on if we want to give
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities any
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
tools to prevent racial profiling by
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
airbnb hosts for um
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
on their guests
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
so i think those are all things that
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
could be looked at in an interim study
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee and that's why i support this
 
01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.590 align:start position:0%
committee and that's why i support this
question

01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
i support the premise of this bill it's
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of private property
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
ownership in in their rights
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
and yet at the same time there needs to
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
be a framework um
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
in which
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals can exist and
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
function within a community so it's a
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
balancing act
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh my
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
position on this or question on this is
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
why is this one use
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
a local issue all of our other zoning
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
uses are local
 
01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
uses are local
decisions

01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that and i think an interim
 
01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.229 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that and i think an interim
study

01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's too much in this bill that needs
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
to have a serious look to get an interim
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
study by november
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i can't support either the inter
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.669 align:start position:0%
 
otp

01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
otp
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion yes
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie yes if i could mr

representative guthrie yes if i could mr
chairman

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
as a local official i i have to i would
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
have to be against this bill
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
as submitted
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
however i have no uh problem
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee votes to interim study i would
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
vote yes
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
on that just to have an opportunity
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
maybe to assist
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
our local communities in this area but
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
once if the bill comes back with any
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
prohibiting any planning or any zoning
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
audience i could not
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh vote for that in the future but i
 
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.470 align:start position:0%
uh vote for that in the future but i
think

01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
if the committee feels that they
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
there is some merit in
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
coming up with some assistance to the
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
local community i will i will and would
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
vote for interim study
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
