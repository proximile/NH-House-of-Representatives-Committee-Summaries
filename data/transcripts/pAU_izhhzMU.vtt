Senate Bill 58 has a very long past

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 align:start position:0%
we introduced the bill
 
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
many years ago
 
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
we started off with the state hospital
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
I had a constituent of mine that was
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
injured quite severely in the state
 
00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.030 align:start position:0%
injured quite severely in the state
hospital

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 align:start position:0%
she was working there
 
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
out for many weeks
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh we made some changes to the state
 
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.369 align:start position:0%
uh we made some changes to the state
hospital

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association came to us a
 
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
year or so later and says well we need
 
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
some help also
 
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
where are we now uh last information
 
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
that I got was that there were 50
 
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.210 align:start position:0%
that I got was that there were 50
assaults

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
assaults
 
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
in medical
 
00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
institutions here in January 50.
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
why do I care well we had a guard at the
 
00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:11.710 align:start position:0%
why do I care well we had a guard at the
Rochester

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
facility frisbee Memorial Hospital
 
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
this was subject of a committee
 
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
committee said well do this do this do
 
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
this the first few things had to do with
 
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 align:start position:0%
escalation and de-escalation techniques
 
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
that was also packaged with some of the
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
language similar to what you see here
 
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
when it came over to the house it says
 
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
well gee that would be two different
 
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
committees we don't want to deal with
 
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
that they because of time they stripped
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
out the portion that you see here
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
past the de-escalation techniques Etc
 
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
and now we're back again
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the Senate uh because of uh press
 
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
that we received uh about putting this
 
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
into the warrantless arrest statute we
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
went and looked for a different place to
 
00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 align:start position:0%
put it
 
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
legislature a long time ago recognized
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
that certain merchants and movie theater
 
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
people deserve some special
 
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.390 align:start position:0%
people deserve some special
consideration

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
we believe that the people that working
 
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
in the hospitals or a patient comes in
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
has a life-threatening situation
 
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
they can't just walk away from a patient
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
whether that patient is belligerent or
 
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.430 align:start position:0%
whether that patient is belligerent or
not

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
um so in here
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and the hospitals aren't in full
 
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
support of putting it in here instead of
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
the and I'm sure that they will say that
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
unless they've changed their mind and I
 
00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 align:start position:0%
don't believe they have
 
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh but this gives them the right to
 
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 align:start position:0%
detain the people this gives the officer
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
you know based on the evidence that he
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
sees when he gets there to do certain
 
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 align:start position:0%
things just as uh if a person is uh
 
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
taking things at a store or recording a
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
movie uh at a movie theater
 
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
they can do that same kind of thing it's
 
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 align:start position:0%
very limited in what they can do
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
many of these because the people will
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
either be uh have mental health issues
 
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
or they will be suffering from drugs or
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
they will be
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
any number of conditions these things
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
will probably never get prosecuted
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
but we need to resolve the situation we
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
need our health care workers to be able
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
to work going to work and coming home
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
from work every day without being
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
assaulted so we appreciate the
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
consideration of the bill I believe it
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
is a good bill it will serve the state
 
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire well thank you
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
any questions for the senator
 
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.670 align:start position:0%
any questions for the senator
representative

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
name

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
Muse yes
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
but um one of the things that I'm
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
curious about Senator are
 
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.330 align:start position:0%
curious about Senator are
um

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
how these incidents evolve in hospitals
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
so you've testified that there are 50
 
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.430 align:start position:0%
so you've testified that there are 50
assaults

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
assaults
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
what's happening what's going on in our
 
00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:44.210 align:start position:0%
what's happening what's going on in our
hospitals

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's basically leading to hospitals
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that in the testimony
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
that before the committee and the
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
commission a lot of it had to do with as
 
00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
I said mental health issues and or
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
drug-related issues
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
okay and again if if the person does not
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to put air quotes around
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
this require the treatment they can ask
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
the person to leave
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay and if they don't leave the police
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
can come in and arrest them the problem
 
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
comes in is when they've got a
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
life-threatening condition that the
 
00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
and they're caught between a rock and a
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
hard place somebody who says I'm going
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
to stab you I'm going to hit you I'm
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
but they can't walk away from that
 
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.909 align:start position:0%
but they can't walk away from that
person

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
50 assaults
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
in January is what I was told
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
and personally I believe that there's a
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%

to please reject it in its current form
 
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
and return it to the thoughtful
 
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:44.660 align:start position:0%
compromise approach that was worked on
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
for much of last year and agreed to by a
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
disparate group of stakeholders this
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
disparate group of stakeholders that
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
came together to agree on language
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
included Nami
 
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:04.019 align:start position:0%
the disability rights Center law
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement the ACLU and the hospitals
 
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
the reason all of these groups agreed on
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
the original language of Senate Bill 58
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
was that it provided Clarity to law
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement around their ability to
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
execute a warrantless arrest for a
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
potential misdemeanor for violence in
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
certain Health Care settings but
 
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:36.380 align:start position:0%
importantly did so without
 
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
criminalizing mental illness
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Senate passed version
 
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
of this bill will further criminalize
 
00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:50.339 align:start position:0%
mental illness by removing important
 
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
limitations in current law
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
therefore broadening the potential for
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
someone suffering from mental illness to
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
be arrested these are patients seeking
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
health care but the bill will make it
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
more likely they'll end up in jail and
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
definitely not get treatment for their
 
00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:16.009 align:start position:0%
definitely not get treatment for their
illness

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.019 align:start position:0%
illness
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
there have also subsequent to the Senate
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
actions on this bill been questions
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
raised as to whether the detainment and
 
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:30.260 align:start position:0%
Restraint of patients would violate
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
standards of the centers for Medicare
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid services and risk a
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
Hospital's certification and funding
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
from these important payers for all
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
these reasons I asked the committee not
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
to pass the bill in its current form but
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
to consider adopting the original
 
00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:56.339 align:start position:0%
version with the clarifying language
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
around medical necessity that I've
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
attached to my letter to you all and I
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to be here
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions
 
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator could you tell us what
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
the impetus was for the big flip what
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
I think there were
 
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
well I'm guessing
 
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.730 align:start position:0%
well I'm guessing
hearsay

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
hearsay
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
there was a senator who didn't like it
 
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.449 align:start position:0%
there was a senator who didn't like it
and

00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
then things snowballed from there last
 
00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:40.019 align:start position:0%
year this original version was passed
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
unanimously by the Senate and sent over
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
to the house whereas Senator grades had
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
it got
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
carved out of something else that was
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
passed so
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
I was not privy to those discussions but
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
I was part of the negotiating group that
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
came to this agreement among all these
 
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
I just have a question about the the
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
amendment what what effect will it have
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
on the bill that we have in front of us
 
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
as amended I see it amends one of the
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
amends a law in in that particular
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph C is not in the amended
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
version of the Senate I'm just wondering
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
how that all will work together so it
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
would not
 
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:38.300 align:start position:0%
but if you were to
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
adopt as an amendment the original
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
language of Senate Bill 58 as introduced
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
this year I would ask you to include
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment which
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
changes just one small part to make it
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
clear that it's not law enforcement who
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
would be determining
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
what medical treatment is necessary but
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
it would be the Judgment of the licensed
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
so you know for the question thank you
 
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I hate that I like this better
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Margaret W Brew

I am a registered nurse

I'm testifying in support of this bill
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
the provision for warrantless arrest was
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
removed from Senate Bill 459 FN this
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
decision afforded the opportunity for
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
the bill to pass and be signed by
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
governor sununu on July 22nd of 2022.
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
in removing it it negated an opportunity
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
to effectively support Health Care
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%

151 billion dollars per year
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
with an average of 250

000 per incident
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
these figures do not capture the hidden
 
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:54.740 align:start position:0%
costs of workplace violence
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
those are emotional pain depression
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
isolation and anxiety
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
in turn this has a direct impact on the
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
ability of the Health Care Organization
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%

accreditation standards
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
it directly impacts the fiscal stability

that upon discharge they would surge out

no reports were filed by the emergency

department staff as they believe nothing

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
when the ICU report RN reported the
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
event it was dismissed as hearsay
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
as there were no witnesses to the event
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
a surgeon performing a technically

bedside
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
the surgeon became enraged due to a
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
the surgeon through the blood-covered

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
the nurse reported the event to the unit
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
manager and the manager said well it's a
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
good thing that you ducked
 
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
this surgeon was not addressed about his
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
actions in the event
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%

the staff involved in these situations
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
perceived there was no recourse other
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
than resignation due to the harmful
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
situations they were involved in
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
the organization did not support the

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
address the situation
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrests would be integrated
 
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
into the organizational's comprehensive
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
workplace violence management plan
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
effectively applying the warrantless
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
arrest law would afford the Health Care
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
System the ability to support those who
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
workplace safety is inextricably
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
connected to patient safety and directly
 
00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
workplace violence has a direct effect
 
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:20.660 align:start position:0%
on employee engagement morale
 
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:24.860 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention of staff
 
00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:27.860 align:start position:0%
violence negatively affects the
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
socioeconomics of all New Hampshire
 
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.669 align:start position:0%
socioeconomics of all New Hampshire
communities

00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
the passing of Senate Bill 58 will
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
positively impact those affected by
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
violence in the health care industry
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
let's see yep representative guy stay
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
like thank you very much
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify
 
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
um it seems that you part of your
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
testimony was about assault by a surgeon
 
00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.059 align:start position:0%
against a nurse
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
um but the bill talks about people in
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the care of
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
the medical professionals not the people
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
performing the medical procedures and so
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
um just wondering maybe I'm
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding but I don't see how
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
this would address that particular
 
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.710 align:start position:0%
this would address that particular
circumstance

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
my point was that we are not only
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
looking the the concern we have and I
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
have specifically is that we're somehow
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
trying to pin bad behavior on the
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
mentally ill
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
it isn't that's why I use that example
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
the bad behavior is across the board it
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
is visitors it is family it is
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
co-workers whether or not they have a
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
specific diagnosis these are the people
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
we're harming each other in the
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
profession the families are coming in
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
and harming us so my example is that
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest is not just about
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
arresting the mentally ill or arresting
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
the patients we need to be considerate
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the whole circumstance that promotes
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
violence in health care and we need to
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
be concerned about all aspects of it
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.150 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
so did the hospital have the option to
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
to take some kind of disciplinary action
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Mark Grossman I'm an Emergency
 
00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:53.450 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Mark Grossman I'm an Emergency
Physician

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
Physician
 
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.110 align:start position:0%
Physician
um

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
I hate to say it over 20 years of
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
experience in emergency medicine and I
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
currently work at the Portsmouth
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
Regional hospital and some other
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire I've been in
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since 2018 I came from
 
00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since 2018 I came from
Florida

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and what I'll tell you is that the
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
importance of health care workers safety
 
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.550 align:start position:0%
importance of health care workers safety
is

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
is
[Music]

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.390 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
I would say take it more seriously in
 
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
I would say take it more seriously in
Florida

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
where I was assaulted by a patient and I
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
called the police and they came
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
interviewed me interviewed Witnesses and
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
they removed the patient immediately
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I was surprised and disappointed
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
when I moved up here
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
that the same safety
 
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539 align:start position:0%
is not afforded to us in the state and
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh I was a victim of an assault while I
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
was up here and the police came and they
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
said first that um well we didn't see it
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
so we can't do anything despite the fact
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
that there are videotapes and Witnesses
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
and then another time when there was an
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
assault and the police were there I said
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
well you've seen it now
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
can you arrest them and they said no
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
because deadly force wasn't used
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's several aspects to
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
this one of them is that the laws don't
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
really protect the health care worker
 
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
and what they tell us is well it's only
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor so if we remove them we
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
still would have to bring them back to
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
be cleared once we bring them to jail so
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that happens is they
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
will the police
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
will sort of victim shame and say are
 
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
you sure you want to testify in front of
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
a jury
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
that you've been assaulted and you have
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
to give your home address and things
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
like that and I've seen this happen I've
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
seen it across different jurisdictions
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
and it's very disheartening to hear that
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
and to have people discourage from
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
pressing charges and from testifying not
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
even given the chance
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
and but I believe this bill will do
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
is give us some peace of mind that when
 
00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
we come to work
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
if we do get assaulted and it's not a
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
mental health issue I mean there are
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
patients with mental health issues that
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
are involved with us but I see it more
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
often than not
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh non-mental Health cases sometimes
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
it's people who are desperate and have
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to lose
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
people who are addicted to drugs people
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
that are expecting something that
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
they're not getting
 
00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:39.539 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes it's people that are
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
alcoholic but sometimes especially post
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's people that are just
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
enraged with the weights in the
 
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
emergency department waiting to go
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
upstairs to get a bed
 
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
um overcrowding and just a lack of staff
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
so they have to wait for lab results or
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
CAT scan results or how come you're not
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
taking care of my mother
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
um and they will get very upset and will
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
get physically violent
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
we're protected by security guards not
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
by police who are armed and sworn
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
officers and those security guards
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
don't have a sworn duty to act if they
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
sense a danger they may try to help and
 
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.950 align:start position:0%
sense a danger they may try to help and
intervene

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
intervene
 
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
if they are overpowered they will step
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
back and call for the police and we have
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
I truly believe that we need to
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
strengthen the um
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
the protections of health care workers
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
we're having problems with recruit
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention of health care
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
workers because they know that if they
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire to work they
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
aren't protected and I've spoken to
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
people that have left the state of New
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to go work in other states
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
where they are protected after they have
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
been assaulted or if they've been a
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
witness to an assault and this is very
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
concerning and I'm very hopeful that
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
this bill will help strengthen
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
our protections and keep us safer in the
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
emergency department I want to remind
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
everybody that three years ago we were
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
celebrating healthcare workers as Heroes
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
for staying and taking care of patients
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
communicable and ill and putting our own
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
lives at risk and we still put our own
 
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
lives at risk every single day and this
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
is one bill that will help so we don't
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
have to worry about at least this aspect
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I I
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted to drill into your statement
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
that that health care workers are
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
unprotected in New Hampshire
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
my understanding is healthcare workers
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
are protected by the same laws against
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
assault that the rest of us are
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
are protected by so so what a what I'm
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
not understanding is how
 
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.370 align:start position:0%
not understanding is how
um

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
is is exactly you know how or why you
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
think that that hospital workers
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
are less protected and I guess the other
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
thing I'm struggling to understand is if
 
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
there if there is an issue with violence
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh in in hospital settings it has a
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
hospital Administration actually had
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
conversations with local police
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
departments about responses and
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe treating incidents at
 
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
hospitals a little bit differently
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that a hospital especially
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
an emergency room
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
has a different clientele and a
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
different sense of Acuity than a local
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
Diner or any other business
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
and we're dealing with people that are
 
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
sick and that are frustrated and it's
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
they're concentrated in one place so
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
the violence is probably more likely
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
because it's there are volatile
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
situations every day and there are
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
disagreements about treatment and people
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
come in and after having consulted
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
Google they expect that the treatment is
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
going to be X Y and Z and when they're
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
not getting X Y and Z they may get upset
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
and I see this every day every single
 
00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:32.750 align:start position:0%
and I see this every day every single
shift

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
shift
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
and once again post pandemic they can't
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
get in to see their primary care doctor
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
their surgery has been postponed some
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
people have lost their insurance because
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
they're not working or they're
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
underemployed so they get frustrated
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford their
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
medication or they come in sicker
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
because they can't follow up with
 
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
primary care and they've lost access to
 
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.930 align:start position:0%
primary care and they've lost access to
care

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
in regards to your second query
 
00:28:59.289 --> 00:28:59.299 align:start position:0%
we meet with police on a regular basis
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
the police aren't staffed
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
to protect our department they will
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
prioritize a response to the emergency
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
room to a call for help
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
and as we all know from watching TV some
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
of these events may be over in seconds
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
or minutes
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
by the time they get there even if they
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
have a five minute response which would
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
be great
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
the incident may be completed whatever
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
so we'll try to deal with it the best we
 
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.950 align:start position:0%
so we'll try to deal with it the best we
can

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
and without the police presence and once
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
they arrive it makes it easier
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
now again once the police do get there
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
if we have this volatile situation where
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
somebody has tried to attack us
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
and the police can't then remove the
 
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.889 align:start position:0%
and the police can't then remove the
patient

00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
the volatility remains
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
sort of answer to be to your question
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
you can really ask that question but
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's where this law would help protect
 
00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
us so once they do respond
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
they can't really do anything right now
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
they will say it's a misdemeanor they
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
didn't witness it and they won't remove
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
person and question that you sound
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what we really need them to
 
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.490 align:start position:0%
and that's what we really need them to
do

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
it's not criminalizing mental health by
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
could you from a doctor from a from a
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
practical standpoint
 
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:28.220 align:start position:0%
you're treating someone in the hospital
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
for whatever injury he becomes violent
 
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.230 align:start position:0%
for whatever injury he becomes violent
disruptive

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
disruptive
 
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
the police come this law is passed he
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
can be arrested
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
but the treatment has to continue
 
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.450 align:start position:0%
but the treatment has to continue
somewhere

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:40.460 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
can you walk us through what what would
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
that look like they can't take him away
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
because he has to be treated
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm inferring from what you said earlier
 
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
that they would just take them right
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
away where would they bring them so
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
that would be honestly on a case-by-case
 
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
basis if it's a family member for
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
example somebody that's not seeking
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
treatment they just happen to be on
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
campus obviously they can be taken away
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
without delay
 
00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
if it's somebody that needs to be
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
admitted to the hospital or is being
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
treated and needs to be in the emergency
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
department for that treatment for X
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
number of hours
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
I would say that either the police would
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
stay there and they would have them in
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
custody and remove them once they're
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
cleared medically
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
they would have to come back or you know
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
the deputy sheriff would come or
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
something along those lines from
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
Corrections then they would still be in
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
custody while being treated
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up and if they're admitted
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
it's the same we we've had prisoners who
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
are admitted to the hospital and they
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
have a guard that's staying with them
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that
 
00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
everybody is safe including the patient
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
and I agree the patient may be
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
vulnerable as well
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
and they do deserve treatment and I'm
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
not saying that they don't deserve
 
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.810 align:start position:0%
not saying that they don't deserve
treatment

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
if they can be cleared and removed and
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
it's safe then I would advocate for that
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
if not then we still need our protection
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
and what I've seen in other states that
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
I've worked in over the years
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
that's if they're arrested they get
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
arraigned or whatever it is then
 
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
Corrections will stay with them a
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
corrections officer
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
or a sheriff's deputy in the state
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Amanda Purdy
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you doctor for
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have two part
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
questions one is you you know describe
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
the whole scenario Workforce shortage
 
00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:54.059 align:start position:0%
not just at the hospital at the police
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
at you know entire
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh community in in different forms
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
that's affecting the response the
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
emergency crisis response
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
and how does this impact if the
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
communities have
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
um crisis mobile crisis
 
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.669 align:start position:0%
um crisis mobile crisis
um

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
units and
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
has that alleviated some of the flash
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
points at the emergency room if the
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
crisis is interwined before the patient
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
or before the person gets to the
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
emergency room deflated
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
I of course I and I'm actually a huge
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
proponent of this I although I don't
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
believe it's completely rolled out in
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
the state it's something that's
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
relatively new
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'm excited to see it and I think uh the
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
de-escalation of these cases before they
 
00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
come to the emergency department is
 
00:33:57.779 --> 00:33:58.850 align:start position:0%
come to the emergency department is
vital

00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
vital
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
and it's been effective and I think our
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
psychiatric holds in the emergency
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
department are down but they're still
 
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.250 align:start position:0%
department are down but they're still
there

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't think every Community is as
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
well served
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
as they deserve to be within the state
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but again this is
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
something that I believe is a work in
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
progress and I'm looking forward to its
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you so there are
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
tools that's available but not
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
completely implemented
 
00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:32.510 align:start position:0%
completely implemented
so

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
from your perspective as a provider this
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
is another tool in the toolbox to
 
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
de-escalate and provide a safe
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
environment for everybody to provide a
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
patient family everybody yes I I agree
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
probably isn't the best place for
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who's having a mental health
 
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.250 align:start position:0%
somebody who's having a mental health
crisis

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
um and again I want to reiterate that
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily the patience I'm
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
talking about that are perpetrating
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
these assaults
 
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:11.339 align:start position:0%
um but they may trigger other people so
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
if they're in the hallway waiting and
 
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:17.780 align:start position:0%
they sort of start getting
 
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.569 align:start position:0%
they sort of start getting
agitated

00:35:19.569 --> 00:35:19.579 align:start position:0%
agitated
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
frustrated what have you that made and
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
I've seen this it becomes sort of a
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
domino effect where other people around
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
them get frustrated and upset and they
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
see well this person's getting so much
 
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
attention and I'm not
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
so I've seen that as well but again to
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
answer your question I I believe that
 
00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
this is something that will benefit us
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm sitting here wondering and I hear
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's because it's only a misdemeanor
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
they can't do anything
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
so in my head I'm thinking we need to
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
raise the level of this assault on a
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
health care worker
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
so that they can do something
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
it goes up to a felony then they can
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
take them all right and that and that
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
would mirror other states laws
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah uh and just for clarity I'm an EMT
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
work for a fire department uh
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
one of my Crews was just involved in the
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
melee at a hospital
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that it almost got his nose broken
 
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579 align:start position:0%
while trying to protect a nurse from uh
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
someone who is intoxicated so I'm well
 
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.910 align:start position:0%
someone who is intoxicated so I'm well
aware

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:36:43.569 --> 00:36:43.579 align:start position:0%
and I do believe we need to do something
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
and not just a little feel-good thing
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
something that actually protects our
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
so do you think we should raise this is
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
my question because I know he was going
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
to ask if there was a question in there
 
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.450 align:start position:0%
to ask if there was a question in there
yeah

00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
I think that whatever
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
laws need to change
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you what the penalties
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
should be or what the category of crime
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's felonious or misdemeanor
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
but I think whatever it needs to be to
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
have these
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
assailants removed
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's how you should Define it I can't
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
say again whether it's a felony or
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but it should be the level
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
that somebody's removed
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
I got that
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony doctor
 
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
oh representative breeds here okay
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
question as far as Healthcare uh the
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
hospital administrators do you find that
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
they sometimes are a roadblock to
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
calling for police help and it's and if
 
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
that if they do frown on that and make
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
it you know
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
something they don't encourage do you
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
think that something should be added as
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
a protection against for for health care
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
workers who have called the police I I
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
don't believe so I I at my hospital our
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
Administration has been very supportive
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
of of protecting us
 
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
again they have no role in the
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the laws
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
um so but they would never say to us
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
well don't call the police or don't
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
testify or don't press charges because
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
it's in their best interest to keep
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
their workers safe and keep the patients
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
safe and keep it a healthy working
 
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.990 align:start position:0%
safe and keep it a healthy working
environment

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you also one of my ministers is
 
00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:44.220 align:start position:0%

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Josh the chair recognizes Josh

thank you Josh the chair recognizes Josh
Henry

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
Jason

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody uh Jason Henry
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to give you some
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
I want to give the end result if a bill
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
like this goes into effect
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
so I agree healthcare workers getting
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
assaulted is is horrible I have
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers inside my own jail I
 
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
get assaulted it's
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
it is difficult I have over 50 of my
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
inmates are on some sort of psychotropic
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
medication the rate of violence has gone
 
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
up tremendously over the past couple
 
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.990 align:start position:0%
up tremendously over the past couple
years

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
um we have seen more in-house
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
um psychiatric patients
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
that have been charged with some sort of
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
assault I have people that are iea
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
status and voluntary
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
um you know emergency admissions sitting
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
inside of my jail
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
because they're a mental health crisis
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
and severe month Health crisis it may
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
have salted a staff member at one of the
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they send to jail
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
now at the jail we're not equipped to do
 
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
four-point restraints we cannot force we
 
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
do medication
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
I am concrete and steel
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
and it's not a place for somebody to
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
mental health so I think a couple things
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
in this law one I hear somebody who's
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
not in mental health distress or crisis
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
I get that
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's the person you arrest and I agree
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
that there is laws about there for being
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
assaulted if you want to enhance the
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
penalties maybe on a on the First
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
Responders and the um workers of the
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
hospital that might make sense but the
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
laws are out there for if you're
 
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.750 align:start position:0%
laws are out there for if you're
assaulted

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
assaulted
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
I am very concerned about those in
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis I testified in this
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
bill in 2021 when it came out gain the
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
end result if somebody's in Mental
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
Health crisis why are we sending to the
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
jail I in turn when they get to us they
 
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
need a higher level of care than the
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
jail can give now we have some medical
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
staff and those kinds of things but in
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
turn we bring them back to the Geo to
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
the hospital the same place they
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
probably assaulted somebody and they're
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
very angry with us because we brought
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
them back
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
and just because I have a officer there
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean they're going
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to stop another assault
 
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
they're there in proximity because they
 
00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:17.579 align:start position:0%
still have to stay out of the way
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
because a person's getting care so that
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
does not solve this issue okay they're
 
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
still going to get charged either way so
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're bringing them it's somebody who's
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
in the middle of getting care to a jail
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
to bring back to get care okay so we're
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
interrupting the care so I think that's
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
counterproductive of what we're trying
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
to again Mental Health crisis somebody
 
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
that's actually in Mental Health crisis
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
so I think we need to separate the two
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh somehow some way because there's a
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
big difference with there
 
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:54.770 align:start position:0%
big difference with there
um

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
so I also heard out here
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
congregate settings basically you have
 
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
shelters that have the same issue a
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
bunch of people that are angry and stuff
 
00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:02.579 align:start position:0%
like that and they get assaulted you
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
take this to the next level and they
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
also get a higher level if they're
 
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:09.020 align:start position:0%
assaulted I understand hospitals don't
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
they're not equipped to keep these
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
people there
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
neither are the jails but the state of
 
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been in a fight back
 
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
and forth and has been determined that
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done for the
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
mental illness and my humble opinion is
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
to be more in brick and mortar someplace
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
to bring them to and that's probably a
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
lot of other states you have is some
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
place that specializes to bring them to
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
not just a
 
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
County facility where they all go to
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
where we have limited staff limited
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
resources because it's a short-term
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
turnaround they're designed for
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
pre-trial and a few sentence it sends
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
less than a year the reason why you get
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
sentenced standing over a year State
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
Prison has a lot more resources than a
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
county does so Michael's only concern
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
releases what are we doing with the
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
people in Mental Health crisis and I do
 
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
believe that we will be arresting our
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
way and putting into jail somebody to
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
what is your Staffing like I mean do you
 
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
have the ability the staff to be able to
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
um example you know officers arrest
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
somebody and they have to go back and
 
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.329 align:start position:0%
somebody and they have to go back and
they

00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
um I mean I guess you wouldn't get
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
involved until they were held after a
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
bail determination was made correct
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
right after the rest is made some sort
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
of bail put on correct no bail or
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
whatever bail whatever happens then we
 
00:43:29.089 --> 00:43:29.099 align:start position:0%
would then they become our ours and
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
whether I have Staffing or not if they
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
have to go back I have to send some
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
money and like we are 35 Staff members
 
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.109 align:start position:0%
money and like we are 35 Staff members
short

00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
um state prisons over 100 plus short
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
we're all short yeah but it doesn't make
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
a difference we would have to go back
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't necessarily preclude
 
00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
that's going to stop from being
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
assaulted again again we're in proximity
 
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
and it's happened multiple times even an
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
ambulances unfortunately we're in the
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
back of the ambulance and the patient
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
who's in severe mental health crisis
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
they could do all kinds of stuff
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
assaults person and ambulance right but
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
they don't turn back around
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
and bring them back to the jail right
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
right they take him to the hospital who
 
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:04.730 align:start position:0%
right they take him to the hospital who
has

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
the care of things that they can do that
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
frankly I cannot at a jail so that's my
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
concern those are in Mental Health
 
00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:15.890 align:start position:0%
concern those are in Mental Health
crisis

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative means pretty
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
my question the same question I ask you
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
about de-escalation how is that protocol
 
00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:31.819 align:start position:0%
helpful in reducing the
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
crisis mental health or dual diagnosis
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
crisis de-escalation is the first step
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
and how are we doing in terms of the
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
state and how would it impact
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
if this law is passed or not passed
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
so this law doesn't
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
really affect my de-escalation because I
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
this would be arrested and come to me
 
00:44:59.329 --> 00:44:59.339 align:start position:0%
jails in general that is huge what we do
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
is de-escalation we train so much in
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
de-escalation because we are there
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours a day seven days a week
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
so we do not like to get wrestling
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
matches or have to report so we do a lot
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
of de-escalation uh my previous life I
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
was a full-time police officer okay so
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
then I moved into Corrections there's
 
00:45:17.329 --> 00:45:17.339 align:start position:0%
still a lot of work and good work being
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
done out there in de-escalation on the
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
streets but uh with the Acuity that is
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
out there it is tough to de-escalate all
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
these situations we're getting I think
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement General and people in
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
general are getting better uh but with
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
this bill in general for us it is
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
already out of basically our hands
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're arresting and bringing to us and
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
we have to figure out
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
what we can or cannot help this person
 
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.170 align:start position:0%
what we can or cannot help this person
with

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in your opinion
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
the end effect of a bill like this would
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
be the Rockingham County Jail could see
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
an increase of mental health patients an
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
exponential increase of mental health
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
patients and one that you may not be
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
sufficiently take on
 
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
we've seen a huge increase just over the
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
past couple of years so we her lack of
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
capacity to take on that we have to deal
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
with I've been in Corrections over 20
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
plus years this has been a trend going
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
this way I was Merrimack County for
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
years and I will say the state hospital
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
here when somebody would assault
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
somebody they would send them to us and
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
I knew the person that ran and called
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
them you know God was well
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
they may have had a moment of brevity
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
basically they need a break too so they
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
sent into US knowing that there's gonna
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
be no culpable state of mind they're not
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
going to get convicted again I'm talking
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
people Mental Health crisis they're
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
you're gonna charge a big charge but not
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
ten times it gets dropped because they
 
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
have some sort of mental illness that no
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
culpable State of Mind
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
and again yes it gets them out of the
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
hair somewhere else to somewhere else is
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
a jail because there is no other
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
alternative right now until some other
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
things are built or staffed or other
 
00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.190 align:start position:0%
things are built or staffed or other
things

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
question so we are hearing
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
right two very different sides of the of
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
the same story
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
so my question is when we heard from the
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
ER doctor
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
that when they called and they said well
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't witness this sorry and then
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
the other example was well it wasn't
 
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
if I'm remembering correctly a deadly
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
threat I think so can you explain
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
how is that handled so what what do you
 
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.750 align:start position:0%
how is that handled so what what do you
do

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
well I can't spot I mean I could try to
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
speak to it but again just for those
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
foreign police officer but that is on
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
the police end two things one if it's a
 
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
class if it's a Class A misdemeanor that
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
is that is offense that you can go to
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
jail for so it's a restable it's a
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
restful fence and go to jail
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
um so it doesn't have to be necessary to
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
be a felony one two a warrantless arrest
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
for me personally looking at is you know
 
00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
you have for domestic violence and a few
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
other ones because within that time
 
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
frame that they're going to go out and
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
significantly hurt the person the the
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
imminent danger imminent flight those
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
kinds of things so warrantless arrest if
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
you open that up for me what does it
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
stop where does it stop there for this
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
arrest like you said we have laws
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
protect each other if I if I can now say
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
I was assaulted and my friend saw me get
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
assaulted and now the police can just
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
arrest them because the warrantless
 
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.190 align:start position:0%
arrest them because the warrantless
arrest

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
I get very nervous about that I do think
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
it will increase
 
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
um the jails I think it'll also be very
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
difficult for police officers because
 
00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
you're going to see their volume go up
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
and again I heard in here that while a
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
police can arrest them and stay with
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
them they won't stay with them it's not
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to happen this goes through
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to arrest them
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
bring them to jail
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to stay unless
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
you're gonna put some sort of Bill they
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
have to stay because they don't have the
 
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:38.099 align:start position:0%
manpower to do it so they're going to
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
bring it to us why they're in crisis
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
mode probably could be wrestling could
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
get further injury or anything else
 
00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:43.670 align:start position:0%
get further injury or anything else
again

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
back to the hospital
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
and now I sympathize the hospital
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
there's no we there's no winning with
 
00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:57.670 align:start position:0%
there's no we there's no winning with
this

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
representative Cameron
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
superintendent for taking my question
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm going back to to my recollection
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
this bill says that it would be lawful
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
for a health care provider or his agent
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
to detain a person that has committed
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
one of these acts
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
until a peace officer can come and take
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
them away
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
how much time do you spend
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
initially for uh somebody new to the job
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
and annually on reasonable Force
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
for us reasonable Force so uh first we
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
have the academy which in there it's at
 
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
least an eight-hour training and four
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
Corrections at least you have to do 35
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
hours of training a year and use of
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
force is one of those trainings for us
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.859 --> 00:49:51.290 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would be extremely
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
important for the health care provider
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
or his agent to have that same training
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
so that a person is not having
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary Force used on them to detain
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
them for the peace officer absolutely
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
anybody should have the training because
 
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:11.930 align:start position:0%
anybody should have the training because
again

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative salik thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question how
 
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
like four or five in Rockingham County
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
so there's quite I mean there's small
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
hospitals larger hospitals so but our
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facilities Exeter
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
so they see the bulk of all of our stuff
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay and the way that I read this it
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be any medical setting so that
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
would include all the convenient care
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
places and urgent cares and whatnot so
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
if they were all saying you need to
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
provide this do you have anywhere close
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
to the capacity to manage any of this
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
no but
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
and two different things if it's
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
somebody that's not a mental health
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
crisis yes that's what we're designed
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
for we're designed as a jail for
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
somebody that has broken the law that we
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
have to deal with until they can go to
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
court or whatever if something's a
 
00:51:06.049 --> 00:51:06.059 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis then the answer is
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
no we I am over capacity now of what we
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
have inside of there people waiting for
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
beds at the state hospital or number 21
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
in the queue I have people going to spew
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm opening up extra units
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
specifically for mental health I just
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
hired another I'm adding 26 extra more
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
hours before mental health the explosion
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
of mental health is across the board
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
everywhere and so the end result is we
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
see a lot of it in the jails and a huge
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
increase of people being arrested and
 
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
then we still dealing with them and what
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
what can we do with them so if those
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
places all had the ability to do this
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what's going to happen but
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
the treatment would not be where I would
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable of the for the patient
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.020 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
just give us a quick overview of what
 
00:52:01.609 --> 00:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
kind of of help or assistance you
 
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
actually get to this from the state uh
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
when you have uh prisoners who are in
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis so is any type of
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
support available at all or are you just
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
expected to wear how these folks
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
Warehouse these folks until their Trials
 
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
come up uh or they're released
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
help from the state uh little from the
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
county so the counties we support
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
everything it's all our budget like I
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
have full-time mental health people I
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
have clinicians and case managers
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
everything else if somebody has to go to
 
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire hospital then we have
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
paper we have to do we have petitions
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things we have to run
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
through to get them up to there uh then
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
if they can get there which again like I
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
have somebody else 21 in a queue I
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
thought people wait for months like the
 
00:52:48.049 --> 00:52:48.059 align:start position:0%
hospitals do to get to the state
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
hospital and they turn around and
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
stabilize them within two days I don't
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
know how but anyways and they come back
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
um and then for sbu the state prison
 
00:52:58.609 --> 00:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
that's far and few between we signed up
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
there and that's a really high Acuity
 
00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:02.300 align:start position:0%
case that needs to be in inside of there
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
but uh for the counties itself no it's
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
our it's your local County dollars and
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
whatever they can afford to have inside
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
facilities so each facility is a little
 
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.690 align:start position:0%
facilities so each facility is a little
different

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
of how much they have to offer these
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
people that are a mental health crisis
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
some have more some have less
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
um depending on again what you can
 
00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.870 align:start position:0%
um depending on again what you can
afford

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
specifically what what kind of resources
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
do you have uh to support these people
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
up in Rockingham County I I have a
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
full-time mental health person on staff
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
I have a license now called drug
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
counselor I have two case managers I
 
00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579 align:start position:0%
have another through what we we um
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
contract what's called Prime care it's
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
our medical they have a mental health
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
provider we have they have doctors there
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
on they come in every week twice a week
 
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
at least we have 24-hour Medical Care
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
with our nurses
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
so we have a pretty robust we're the
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
second entire country for County
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
facilities they have our own opioid
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
treatment program but then you take it
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
to another facility a lot of the
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
facilities are not 24-hour care so
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's no nurses on it the middle of
 
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
the night they don't have the mental
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
health might be a person that's
 
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.349 align:start position:0%
health might be a person that's
part-time

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
okay because they just that's all they
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
have so you're running the game at
 
00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County where I'm at now it's
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
the third jail I've been at okay I was
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
at Carroll County before very small a
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
very limited budget limited what I had
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
up there to where I have very very
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
robust of what I have now
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
so it's really all over the map
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
I just have a quick question you put it
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
you're on a pretty bright line between
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
people that are a mental health crisis
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
and in in those that are not that either
 
00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:48.059 align:start position:0%
one of those could cause a disturbance
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
and just in my reading in the bill and
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
it appears to me we'll probably talk
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
more about this in executive session is
 
00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
that the bill itself does it says detain
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
any person I I'm do you think that that
 
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
bright line distinction between those
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
two types of people is important in this
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
case I I do because someone who's in a
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis needs a higher
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
level of care than what a jail can
 
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
support again let's go back to the
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
medications that I cannot cannot do
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things and it's
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
concrete and steel it was not built for
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
knowledge is built forward to for mental
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
health patients and that's what they are
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
they're patients if they're in crisis
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
and their patients
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
in my mind that's what they need to be
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
need to be taken care of so I do think
 
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
there should be a line that is distinct
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
and how you want to find that and
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
however you want to clear them because
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
the 2021 if everyone goes back to that
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
there was a part of the bill that said
 
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
that it had to be cleared
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
um from their Mental Health crisis but
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
it was never defined who cleared it I
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
asked was the chiefs of police they said
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
no I asked if it's a jail no it's the
 
00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
hospital that wants some no offense
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
hospital they want them out of there
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
it's our best interest to get them out
 
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
and then I bring them back and then I
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
have mental health people on to say well
 
00:55:59.930 --> 00:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
wait why are they here and I can tell
 
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.710 align:start position:0%
wait why are they here and I can tell
you

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
just this week I have one from a
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
hospital has been released twice came
 
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
back to us and is a mess I'll take one
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
level further Mental Health crisis I
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
just went in at 1 30 this morning for
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
somebody who passed away because their
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
meth Health crisis and drugs
 
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
didn't belong with me but they're no
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
longer here on Earth
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony

at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
I will not um read my testimony you I am
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
it is being passed out we are in strong
 
00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
support of 58.
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
um excuse me Senate Bill 58 and we do
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate Senator Grace support and
 
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
sponsorship of this bill as you have
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
heard there is a big change in this bill
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
which got changed on the senate floor we
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
support the concept of Senate Bill 58
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
and I have communicated with a number of
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
you in the past week or so
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
Regarding why this isn't so important in
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
the the history of this
 
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and I will um I am not going to take
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of your time because it is more
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
important that you hear from those that
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
actually have experienced this and and
 
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
witness it every day including um Mr
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
Patty who will speak in a moment all I
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
need to say is I think some testimony
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is conflating issues this
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
is not um intended to criminalize
 
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health this is really a tool
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
as um as the representative indicated
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
this is a tool for law enforcement they
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
need this they are not here to testify
 
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
but they do not have and again Mr Patty
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
will talk about this in a minute they
 
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:36.299 align:start position:0%
don't have the they believe the
 
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
authority at this time law enforcement
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
to come in and arrest someone without a
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
warrant we do not support enhanced
 
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.569 align:start position:0%
warrant we do not support enhanced
penalties

00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
um and there are reasons for that I know
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
other states have done that
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my colleagues have
 
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:51.799 align:start position:0%
indicated throughout the country
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
it um they don't it doesn't work um and
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
so we this is the approach that we are
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
taking and other states actually have
 
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
adopted our approach
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
um I know there are at least two other
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
states that are trying to get a similar
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced past because enhanced
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
penalties for some of these offenses
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
just will not work and and as indicated
 
00:59:17.569 --> 00:59:17.579 align:start position:0%
by others these are Health Care
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
Professionals that want to care for
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
patients that's why they went into the
 
00:59:21.119 --> 00:59:22.430 align:start position:0%
patients that's why they went into the
profession

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
they do not want a felony on someone's
 
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.329 align:start position:0%
they do not want a felony on someone's
record

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
um and that because that is a pretty
 
00:59:28.079 --> 00:59:29.270 align:start position:0%
um and that because that is a pretty
significant

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
um offense as you as you're aware so uh
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
let me just see here um we are happy to
 
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
work with the committee and I again I
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
have stated that to many of you that we
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
want to get a we believe that it is
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
important that we pass something that
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
ensures that health care workers are
 
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
protected when they are assaulted while
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
they are performing their work we owe it
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
to them to ensure that we provide law
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement with enough with another
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
tool that um they can have when they are
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
called to the hospital to respond to an
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
incident without the ability to arrest
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
without a warrant for misdemeanor
 
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
offenses when appropriate the health
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
care professional is not protected and
 
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
remains vulnerable when they are
 
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
treating patients and at this point I'd
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
like John to talk with the committee
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
about his experience and what other
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
security officers have witnessed in the
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
past few years thank you
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Paula uh good morning thank
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
you everybody for taking the time to
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
consider this legislation
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
so yes I'm John Patty I'm executive
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
director at Catholic Medical Center I'm
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
also a retired sergeant from the
 
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department I have over
 
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
22 years of experience there
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
so as executive director overseeing
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
security I'm aware of the reports of
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
assaults on our employees
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
on many occasions we would call the
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
police to report The Assault on a
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
HealthCare Employee only to be told by
 
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
the police that they would not make a
 
01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:53.579 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest but rather apply for
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
a warrant
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you imagine how
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
frightening it is for a healthcare
 
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.130 align:start position:0%
frightening it is for a healthcare
worker

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
worker
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
who has just been assaulted by somebody
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
um to have to remain in that intimate
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
setting and still provide care
 
01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:12.059 align:start position:0%
I heard domestic violence referenced
 
01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:14.579 align:start position:0%
earlier part of the reason for the
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
change in that statute was to be able to
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
the police are basing their decision not
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
to arrest
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
based on language in the current statute
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
under 594-10 which reads in part if not
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
immediately arrested such person will
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
cause further personal injury or damage
 
01:01:36.049 --> 01:01:36.059 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
this language essentially requires the
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
officer to predict future behavior of
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
the suspect in order to make a
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest in my opinion not
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
making an arrest at that juncture places
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
the victim at risk of another assault
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
which essentially equates to a pattern
 
01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:52.700 align:start position:0%
of abuse
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
with unique unique perspective of having
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
been on both sides of this issue I
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
wanted to amend the language to provide
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
police with more clarity in the statute
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
which would give them greater confidence
 
01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
in making a warrantless arrest
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
while at the same time providing our
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
health care workers a measure of safety
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
and assurance and allowing victims of a
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
crime a sense of control and protection
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
there are current statutes that provide
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
the police the authority to make a
 
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest for certain
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level offenses and I'm
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
asking the same Authority be
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
specifically granted to police in the
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
case of assault against a health care
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
worker by a patient
 
01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:30.140 align:start position:0%
if you're not aware assaults on
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
workplace assaults and workplace
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
violence and Health Care Facilities has
 
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
been increasing concern for health care
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
workers depending on the publication you
 
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
read stats indicate that health care
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
workers are four to five times more
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
likely than other Private Industry
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
employees to be victims of workplace
 
01:02:45.299 --> 01:02:46.609 align:start position:0%
employees to be victims of workplace
violence

01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
there are many studies including some
 
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
from OSHA that show the prevalence of
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
assaults in these settings to support
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
part of the work that went into this
 
01:02:59.930 --> 01:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
bill last year focused on the need for
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
collecting relevant data to support the
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
need for a workplace violence prevention
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
program for healthcare facilities
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
this data will be used to support a
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
commission to review and analyze
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
Healthcare workplace violence and safety
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
issues that are affecting our health
 
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
care workers and organizations
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
when I began this process of trying to
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
have legislation pass to address this
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
concern which I consider it to be a
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
victims rights issue I began collecting
 
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
data from other New Hampshire hospitals
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh between January of 2020 and June of
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
2021 so 18 month period uh 13 of the 26
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals reported data to me
 
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.809 align:start position:0%
hospitals reported data to me
um

01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
that indicated they had 671 assaults
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
during that 18-month period so you know
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
 
01:03:46.079 --> 01:03:46.789 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
um

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
spoke to earlier seven hospitals that's
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
it just seven so five this year
 
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.589 align:start position:0%
it just seven so five this year
um

01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
through February is when I collected the
 
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.490 align:start position:0%
through February is when I collected the
data

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:57.500 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
provided stats that show there were 50
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
assaults so far in our hospitals
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh just to address some of the prior
 
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
there'd be no CMS risk for hospitals
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
for detaining a patient
 
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.170 align:start position:0%
for detaining a patient
um

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
who probably
 
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
six years ago now
 
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.789 align:start position:0%
six years ago now
um

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:24.849 --> 01:04:24.859 align:start position:0%
I had come before
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
the Senate earlier to request
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
legislation for security health care
 
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
workers when after I retired from the
 
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
police department and went to work as
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
the Director of security at CMC and saw
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
what the security officers dealt with
 
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
I was amazed that there was no
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
protection for them in the statutes so I
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
had requested that some legislation be
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
passed and it was RSA 620 7 colon six
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral eight that gives them the
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.119 --> 01:04:58.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
maintain decorum in the hospital is the
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that statute again
 
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
please yes 627 colon six
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
and the the issue of the Mental Health
 
01:05:25.559 --> 01:05:27.109 align:start position:0%
and the the issue of the Mental Health
crisis

01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
is real
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
not minimizing that at all however you
 
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
know I I strongly feel that you know
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
victims of these crimes have rights too
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
and this is where this is coming from I
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
know as a police officer if I
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
was called to
 
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.030 align:start position:0%
was called to
um

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
an event involving somebody who is
 
01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:51.299 align:start position:0%
having a mental health crisis and they
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
assaulted the police officer they would
 
01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
be charged
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's a fact
 
01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
so it's real it's okay that they'd be
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
charged you know we're not minimizing
 
01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.789 align:start position:0%
charged you know we're not minimizing
their

01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
crisis that they may be in
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
but it still doesn't give them the right
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for hearing my
 
01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.710 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for hearing my
testimony

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you could you explain to the
 
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.730 align:start position:0%
thank you could you explain to the
committee

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
who's going to make the determination
 
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
this situation who is suffering from a
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
mental health issue and who is just
 
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
being a criminal when when you have a
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
patient assaulting a health care worker
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
or security officer the police are
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
called they now have the power to arrest
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
who's going to make the call and once
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
they make the call where do they go with
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
the patient so yeah so different
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
considerations right not every assault
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
is committed by someone in a
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis however you know
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
the statute reads that you know when a
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
person is IE8 you know involuntarily
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
they're brought to a hospital for a
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
treatment right so then within 72 hours
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
they have to have a hearing on that so
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
if it's if they've been committed if
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
in our care as a iea patient they've
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
been committed to the state so they are
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
not free to leave anyway right so they
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
would still be eligible for a bail
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
hearing but they're not going to be free
 
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
to leave that's you know one thing if
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
they're committed right they're
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
committed to the state for a reason and
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
they have to be uh you know they have
 
01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
due process and they have to go through
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
their their hearing however there are
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
many many instances where our healthcare
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
workers are being assaulted by you know
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
patients who may be under the influence
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
of drugs right and you know that's a
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
consideration as well for
 
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.470 align:start position:0%
consideration as well for
um

01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
you know the community right but you
 
01:07:44.329 --> 01:07:44.339 align:start position:0%
know they're not getting the same
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
um consideration as mental health
 
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.150 align:start position:0%
um consideration as mental health
patients

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
right so we're not we're not minimizing
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
their actions just because they're under
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
influence of drugs
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
so when we train new staff coming into
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
I often pose this question to them I
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
said it because I was amazed quite
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
frankly not to be dramatic but to see
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
the behavior of
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
some patients in the hospital
 
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
it was stunning to me I was shocked so I
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
tell them I said you know in order to
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
make a determination how you should
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
handle this I said take that person's
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
behavior and move it to a restaurant on
 
01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
Elm Street in Manchester right would
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
anybody put up with that no and they
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't right the police would be
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
called and so the behavior that goes on
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
in the hospital is shocking
 
01:08:41.809 --> 01:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
agreed but to my question who who makes
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
the determination at that moment this
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
person should go with the police to to
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
to be held or is a mental health patient
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
setting aside someone who's been
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
involuntary committed sure
 
01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.450 align:start position:0%
involuntary committed sure
so

01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:55.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:59.050 --> 01:08:59.060 align:start position:0%
any I think any Hospital any medical
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
provider would tell you that the patient
 
01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
would have to be cleared medically first
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
right so if the person is not able to
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
medically cleared then that would be a
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
consideration for all parties right the
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
the doctor
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
the police you know the police still
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
have to do their investigation make sure
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
that there is probable cause to make the
 
01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.130 align:start position:0%
that there is probable cause to make the
arrest

01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
um and then you know this is not a
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory arrest right so they still
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
have the right
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
to make that decision and not arrested
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
however to your point it would be the
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
police and the health care worker making
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and this question
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
is for the person's security here
 
01:09:46.739 --> 01:09:47.930 align:start position:0%
is for the person's security here
um

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
you've obviously been through the police
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
academy and you know that there's a lot
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
of time spent on use of force training
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
constitutional law criminal code the
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
different thresholds of evidence to
 
01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
support a detainment or arrest
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
in how much time is spent on handcuffing
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
defensive tactics and restraint
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
um how much time do you spend with your
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
security officers in your hospital of
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
that same training
 
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
so we have uh 120 hours of
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's field training essentially
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
um and then we have
 
01:10:24.649 --> 01:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
um three hour
 
01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
use of force class to begin with before
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's part of their initial training
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
and then we have annual use of force
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
training uh similar to police
 
01:10:33.179 --> 01:10:34.790 align:start position:0%
training uh similar to police
departments

01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I know you can't speak to this maybe
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association can is that the
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
standard for all hospitals in the state
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
it is not the standard however part of
 
01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:49.940 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 459 last year will require
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
hospitals to provide training
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative pruning oh thank you Mr
 
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
um the training aspect of the staff
 
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
whether not just the security staff at
 
01:11:13.689 --> 01:11:13.699 align:start position:0%
the hospital but also all staff involved
 
01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
in the hospital do they get training of
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
self-defense as well as de-escalation
 
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.750 align:start position:0%
self-defense as well as de-escalation
training

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
so some hospitals provide it we do I
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
can't speak for all but again part of
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 459 last year is that that
 
01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
um I just wonder looking at
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
um uh SB 58 as amended by the Senate
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
um and then the floor amendment to uh
 
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenwald's floor Amendment
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
um are there one of those that you used
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
to think would is preferential and would
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of hospital staff as
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to the other or
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm just looking because I see there
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
are some differences and and uh they
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
certainly amend different statutes so
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
right right thank you for the question
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy um so as
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative Rose excuse me Senator
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald indicated
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
um the amendment
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
that did not pass the floor that was the
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
um the the language that was worked on
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
um as a during the study committee back
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and what was part of 459 last
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
year that did not go all the way through
 
01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
it was pulled out on the floor of the
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
house and that's what resulted in Senate
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill 58. her Amendment
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
moves the reference of medically
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to the end of the sentence but
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
essentially her Amendment which is 1251
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
is what we worked on as she referenced
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
in her testimony with the stakeholders
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
what is what passed
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
um was a the floor amendment that
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Abbas actually Senator gray
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
introduced and that was what was
 
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
agreed to by some of the Senators and
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
what did pass 14 to 9 on the senate
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
floor so I would say
 
01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
um as my testimony stated we this is a
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
very very important issue for us we are
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
happy to work with any and all of you
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
um to get to Yes
 
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
um but we can we could live with the
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
amended bill but I know not everyone
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
here that is going to testify is
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of this of this language for
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
various reasons
 
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
um we we believe it is a creative
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
approach to getting to the solution that
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking for or the goal but but to
 
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
be clear we worked on the original
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
language of Senate Bill 58 that's where
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
we kind of landed as the Healthcare
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
thank you so the floor Amendment uh the
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald's floor amendment was
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
the one that was generally agreed to by
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders yes okay thank you
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%

so you know further questions thank you
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:08.900 align:start position:0%

on behalf of Nami New Hampshire I'm here
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
today to speak in opposition to Senate
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 58 relative to arrests without a
 
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
warrant while in the care of a medical
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
professional on the premises
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
of a residential care or health care
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
facility and I just wanted to let the
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee know that we did not testify
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
on this bill when it was in the Senate
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
because at that time we were one of the
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that worked on the language
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
and had agreed not to oppose it
 
01:16:29.159 --> 01:16:30.470 align:start position:0%
and had agreed not to oppose it
um

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned by way of background for
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
the past two years Nami New Hampshire
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
has been involved with a stakeholder
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
group discussing the issue that is the
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
subject of Senate Bill 58 and was the
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
subject of a study committee the
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
committee to study workplace safety and
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
health care settings
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
at that time the stakeholders agreed a
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
statutory language regarding the use of
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrests in health care
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
settings that could be added to the
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
current warrantless arrest statute the
 
01:16:57.649 --> 01:16:57.659 align:start position:0%
committee's final report contains the
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
language all stakeholders agreed to
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
which was also the language as Senate
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 58 as introduced and as you've seen
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
in the senator rosenwald's floor
 
01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.689 align:start position:0%
in the senator rosenwald's floor
Amendment

01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
despite all stakeholders being in
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
agreement on this language Senate
 
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
Judiciary introduced an amendment that
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
no stakeholders were able to provide
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
input on as it was brought on the floor
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the Senate as you have heard earlier
 
01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.530 align:start position:0%
of the Senate as you have heard earlier
today

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes changement changes
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
to the detainment statute allowing for
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
Hospital Personnel to detain a person
 
01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
who is suspected suspected of committing
 
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor assault
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
due to emergency room boarding the the
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
emergency room boarding crisis where
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
people in psychiatric crisis are waiting
 
01:17:44.209 --> 01:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
for an inpatient bed for days to weeks
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
many times being held against their will
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 58 will disproportionately
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
affect individuals experience a mental
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
health crisis and I know you've heard
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
from the the medical professionals that
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
they do not believe this would
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect people in
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis but I think we also
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
heard Senator gray specifically say that
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
most of these assaults are being
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
committed by people who are either in
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis or there for
 
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
recently Nami New Hampshire has heard
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
from six families whose loved ones have
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
been arrested while on an iea an
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission in an
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
emergency room their stories are
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking and speak to Long waits in
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
the ER ranging from a few days to two
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
weeks while receiving little to no
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
treatment due to this several of the
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
families describe situations where their
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
loved ones many of whom are experiencing
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
symptoms of psychosis and don't know
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
have become agitated resulting in the
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
hospital engaging in in a physical
 
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
restraint which which ends with the
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
patient assaulting a hospital staff or
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
destroying Hospital property
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
these loved ones were then brought to
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
the local County Jail where they
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
remained while waiting for a hospital
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
bed as you heard superintendent Henry
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is often what
 
01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.669 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is often what
happens

01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
if Senate Bill 58 as amended by the
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
Senate passes more and more individuals
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
and families will have to endure the
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
same result people experience in a
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
psychiatric crisis need treatment not
 
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
jail cell confinement
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that an officer
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
can arrest for a felony level offenses
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard earlier whether it was
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
observed by the officer or not therefore
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
we are on we are not talking about those
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
offenses rising to that level but only
 
01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors it is Paramount that people
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
psychiatrically boarding in an emergency
 
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
room continue to have due process
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
protections afforded to them under the
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
law currently if Senate Bill 58 passes
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
people in a mental health crisis would
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
be brought to county jails for
 
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offenses even if they are
 
01:19:50.169 --> 01:19:50.179 align:start position:0%
completely calm when the police arrive
 
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
exacerbating the crisis that they are
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
experiencing and for these reasons Nami
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire opposes Senate bill 58.
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions what I
 
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.149 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions what I
did

01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
want if
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
if I have time I'd like to read a little
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
portion of her testimony or if the
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
committee prefers and I'll let the chair
 
01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
let me know would you prefer that that
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
you read that or would you prefer
 
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:19.260 align:start position:0%

01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
to us did give to you yes so we would
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
prefer instead of you actually reading
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
it if there's a certain you know if
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%

01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be in an emergency room for these
 
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.510 align:start position:0%
to be in an emergency room for these
folks

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
if you've not been inside it I can share
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
about the yellow Paw the yellow pod is
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
um the place in Concord Hospital where
 
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
they hold psychiatric patients
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are a few about eight to nine or
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
so size windowless rooms with a door to
 
01:20:58.490 --> 01:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
each and a bed nothing is allowed that
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
can be used to harm cell for others no
 
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
personal clothing pens or anything like
 
01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:03.770 align:start position:0%
personal clothing pens or anything like
that

01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
it is cold in there but everyone has to
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
deal with that you can sit lie down or
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
move about an aroma sign to you you're
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to keep quiet in there but it
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
is often stressful sounds people yelling
 
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
or crying and screaming and sometimes it
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
is somewhat more quiet only certain
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
staff are allowed in or out with a badge
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
who have the right to access it and at
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
times limited visitors it is only for
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
people deemed at imminent risk
 
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
themselves or others due to psychiatric
 
01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
illness in the yellow pod you wear paper
 
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
scrubs and gripper socks the in your
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
monitor 24 7 by staff in the area who
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
does status evaluations and provide
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
transitional psychiatric nursing care to
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
the patients
 
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
there's also a common shower toilet
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
which patients can use which they are
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
escorted to and monitored during use she
 
01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:53.900 align:start position:0%
goes on to talk about her son on day 13
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
becoming very agitated he was then
 
01:21:59.630 --> 01:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
walking around his cell pacing it his
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
cell excuse me his room and pasting it
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
and doing kicks
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
um not hurting anybody not hurting
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
himself but the staff asked him to calm
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
down he couldn't calm down so they
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
attempted to put him in a four-point
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
restraint at which time he stepped very
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
hard on one of the security guards feet
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
he was then arrested and taken to jail
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
now I will answer any questions that you
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
representative Prue did you have a
 
01:22:29.219 --> 01:22:34.610 align:start position:0%
representative Prue did you have a
question

01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:37.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:40.340 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm not gonna no
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.610 --> 01:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
um my question is your preference your
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill as it is right now
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate and your
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
preference would be to have the original
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
language of the bill as amended by the
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald amendment is that correct well
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
let me be clear we were never in support
 
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
of this bill to begin with when we
 
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
worked with the stakeholders we agreed
 
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
not to oppose it
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
with the language that they brought
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
forward in Senate Bill 58 in the
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
language that was a part of Senate bill
 
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
I believe was 459 last year so we're not
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
in support of any language you know
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
requesting right now for this bill to be
 
01:23:21.659 --> 01:23:23.930 align:start position:0%
requesting right now for this bill to be
itl'd

01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
itl'd
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
representative proof question I reframed
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
I hear you're concerned
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the patients
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
how do you suggest we address the
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
concerns of the health care workers they
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
are still able to press charges and if
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
somebody is completely calm being
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
restrained by chemical restraints or by
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
physical restraints there's no reason
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
that a law enforcement officer cannot
 
01:23:59.810 --> 01:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
leave the premises go get a warrant come
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
back with it and then rest arrest the
 
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
individual they don't need to be
 
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
arrested under a warrantless arrest
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's about the due process that's being
 
01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
afforded the patients and so I would
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
argue that if somebody is being
 
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
chemically or physically restrained and
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
are no longer a threat to anybody in the
 
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
hospital that the officer can leave
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
go get the warrant and come back and
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
then arrest it if they're able to obtain
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
a warrant based on what they hear from
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
do you know how long they can chemically
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
restrain them I don't that would be a
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
question for the hospital
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
so they could come out of that chemical
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
restraint and then act again while the
 
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
officer is off again they weren't is
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
that true
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
potentially yes yeah that's right they
 
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
could also act up again if they're
 
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
brought to the the county jail and are
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
then processed brought back to the
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
hospital because they still need
 
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you to to kind of sum up where we
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
are it sounds like
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
both versions of the bill
 
01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:14.060 align:start position:0%
um are uh
 
01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
objectionable uh to you uh but it sounds
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
like the original version of the bill is
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
less objectionable uh can you tell us
 
01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
why that might be yeah we know we we do
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
not oppose Senator Rosen while Amendment
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
and that is because that Amendment still
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
affords the protections under the due
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
process where
 
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
the the language that's contained here
 
01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:51.260 align:start position:0%
there's also more language that
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
basically says that if there is a
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
continued threat that's when a
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest can be done but if
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's not a continued threat if the
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
person is no longer a threat then that's
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
when the officer would have to actually
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
go get the warrant and come back so
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
that's the protection that's in the
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
Senate the Rosenwald amendment that is
 
01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:17.219 align:start position:0%
not in the the current bill
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying it
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative mangaputi thank you madam
 
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
um so basically what Nami is saying is
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
protect the due process for people with
 
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
mental illness and this bill doesn't go
 
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
so far to make sure that protection
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
is available to the Mental Health crisis
 
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
people with Mental Health crisis versus
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
what is the threshold to be established
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
for the providers
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's a delicate balance so what is the
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
level that we can reach to protect the
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
people with mental illness and where
 
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
does that fall with the
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenwald's yeah we did reach
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
that agreement
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um you know a couple of years ago and
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:16.139 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 459 was brought forward
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why Senate Bill 58 was
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
brought forward again this year
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
but yeah Senate the Senate Bill 58 as
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
introduced does afford the protections
 
01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
that Nami New Hampshire thinks are
 
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
important for people who are boarding
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
Miss nabel
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
I think I'm pronouncing that properly
 
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:59.570 align:start position:0%
I think I'm pronouncing that properly
Pam

01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you it's actually Pam DiNapoli
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
poor handwriting
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Pam DiNapoli I'm a
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
nurse and I represent the New Hampshire
 
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association which is a membership
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
organization of over 2 000 nurses and we
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
represent the 20 000 nurses in the state
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
I did submit my written testimony and
 
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to speak to that testimony
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
but essentially what I submitted was
 
01:28:26.649 --> 01:28:26.659 align:start position:0%
results of a survey that we recently
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
conducted of emergency room Personnel in
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
the state to ask them about this bill
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
and overwhelmingly they were supportive
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
and so what I want to do now is just
 
01:28:40.729 --> 01:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
kind of talk about some key points that
 
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
I'd really like to focus on number one
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
there is no federal legislation
 
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
currently that affords the same
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
protection against workplace violences
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
other Industries such as the airline
 
01:28:53.689 --> 01:28:53.699 align:start position:0%
workers so we know that violence in
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
health care settings is only
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
intensifying and contributing factors
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
that I want to highlight
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
include work Workforce shortages which
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
aggravates a population that's already
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
aggravated so increased wait times
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
substance use and overall societal
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
tolerance of this Behavior this bill um
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
is focusing on misdemeanors so while
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals do have
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
protections against felonies not
 
01:29:26.689 --> 01:29:26.699 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors one example of this is a
 
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
patient refuses a medication and the
 
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
nurse brings in the medication the
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
patient punches the nurse the nurse goes
 
01:29:37.129 --> 01:29:37.139 align:start position:0%
to employee health the nurse is cleared
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
to go back to work she goes back to the
 
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
emergency department the same patient is
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
there and she's required to care for
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
that patient she's asked by security
 
01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
does she want to press charges she says
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes the police come they do an
 
01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:51.980 align:start position:0%
investigation and they say we have no
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
grounds to arrest this patient there are
 
01:29:58.729 --> 01:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
no law legislation that prevents assault
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
against health care workers in this
 
01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
situation we could issue a summons on
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
discharge so at that time the nurse now
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
is required to care for a patient who
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
has already punched her in the face
 
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot of opposition that this
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
says criminalizes behavior and I think
 
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
you heard testimony only that that
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
arrest is not required so the due
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
process is still guaranteed and then the
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
decision to make the arrest one thing
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been mentioned it may seem
 
01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:31.139 align:start position:0%
irrelevant but is very relevant to us is
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
that currently in Vermont there's State
 
01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 36 which is an act relating to
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
permitting an arrest without a warrant
 
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
for assault and threatens against health
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
care workers and disorderly conduct in
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
the health care facilities while this is
 
01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
relevant is that many of our nurses from
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire work at Dartmouth and many
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont nurses work at Dartmouth which
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
is in New Hampshire so can you imagine
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
being a nurse who's working in New
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lives in Vermont who's covered
 
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
by this law but the patient can't be
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
arrested in New Hampshire and nurses
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
knowing that we have been trying to
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
advocate for this law for over eight
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
years so I think one of the words that
 
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
I've heard over and over is toolbox and
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
while this is not gonna it's not gonna
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
prevent the problem it's really going to
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
enhance the ability ability for us to
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
protect our health care workers which in
 
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
time the workplace shortage is really
 
01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
relevant I think the other thing that I
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
want to say is that all of our nurses
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
are trained in de-escalation techniques
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
so de-escalation is not prevention it's
 
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
an intervention and what we want to do
 
01:31:38.530 --> 01:31:38.540 align:start position:0%
is we want to think about prevention and
 
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
this act may be a deterrent so a patient
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
who is investigated by the police for
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
assault may think again about this and
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
and I do understand nami's position in
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
the position of the testimony around the
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
mentally ill but that's the population
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
that nurses are really trained to
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
de-escalate and deal with it's the
 
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
patient who just pops off because
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're mad that they had to wait 20
 
01:32:05.689 --> 01:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
minutes to be seen in the emergency
 
01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
department we can't predict that so um
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
in the behaviors that we can predict we
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
have interventions what we want to do is
 
01:32:16.129 --> 01:32:16.139 align:start position:0%
to try to think about deterrence so
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
those are the important points that I
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
think are important to us as nurses in
 
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
the state so thank you for letting me
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
chair calls gosba cinet from the ACLU
 
01:32:35.520 --> 01:33:05.510 align:start position:0%

01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
committee it's nice to be here Jill
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
Bissonnet I'm the legal director at the
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
um we're here to testify against
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh the version of SB 58 that was amended
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
on the senate floor
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I could explain why but I do want a
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
flag as well that like Nami New
 
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do not object
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
to the original version of sb58 as
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
introduced including the clarifying
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
language that Senator Rosenwald added so
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
no objections to that language we were
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
involved in negotiating that language so
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to be very clear but the
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
new version that is before uh this uh
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
this committee is something that we have
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
profound concerns about and I would like
 
01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
to outline those
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
um but I do want to just just say a few
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
words about the history of of this this
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
has been we've this has been the product
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
of negotiation and discussion now for
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
um I think to get to that language that
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
we ultimately agree to took took a lot
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
of thinking and a lot of reflection
 
01:34:18.649 --> 01:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
um particularly reflection with respect
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
to the real concerns that have been
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
raised by Hospital staff
 
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
um they're real these incidents are
 
01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
certainly to to anyone who who visits a
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
doctor which is most folks or physician
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
or any type of hospital staff you know
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
it is concerning when hospital staff are
 
01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.030 align:start position:0%
it is concerning when hospital staff are
assaulted

01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
assaulted
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
but there are also some serious
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
interests on the other side right
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
including the ability to make sure that
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
due process exists due process insofar
 
01:34:46.129 --> 01:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
as people aren't arrested without
 
01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
um that are not needlessly arrested and
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
having their Liberty needlessly
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
restrained and of course the other
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
countervailing Interest being I think
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
our our general desire and the general
 
01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
consensus that we shouldn't be
 
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
criminalizing mental illness that folks
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
need treatment they don't need they
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't need jail if they're going through
 
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
a particular crisis and I do think the
 
01:35:07.729 --> 01:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
original version of SB 58
 
01:35:07.739 --> 01:35:08.770 align:start position:0%
original version of SB 58
um

01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:08.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
really reflects that balance and I'll
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'll explain why in a few minutes but I
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
also want to flag that the committee to
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
study workplace safety that is a product
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
of that negotiation I have attached to
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
my testimony as exhibit a so you can see
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
exactly you know what where the
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
committee landed
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
um two years ago and the language in SB
 
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
58 the original version is reflected in
 
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
that report
 
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
and of course that report among other
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
things also talks about the need for
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
de-escalation techniques and the need
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
for more data frankly on the degree to
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
which assaults are occurring in New
 
01:35:46.090 --> 01:35:46.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is a lack of data
 
01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:48.659 align:start position:0%
anecdotes sure real incidents have
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
occurred sure but the degree in scale
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
how many of these are felony assaults
 
01:35:55.729 --> 01:35:55.739 align:start position:0%
right how many of these involve
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
individuals are going through crisis I
 
01:35:59.570 --> 01:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
don't think yet we have a good handle on
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
that information and that was in part
 
01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:04.460 align:start position:0%
designed to be addressed in SB 459
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
passed last year which hasn't yet gone
 
01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
into effect which will go into effect in
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
mid 2023 which is designed to address
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
some of that that data those data issues
 
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
so I my own view is before you strip
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
away some of the due process protections
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
and the warrantless arrest statute which
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
this which
 
01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
the as amended version of sb58 would do
 
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
I think we should just let's see how
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
that bill unfolds with respect to the
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
data that we ultimately evaluate
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
um but as I said on the senate floor
 
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
um this compromise language was was
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh upended
 
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
um and the vital protection that was
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
removed in the original version of sb58
 
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
was the ability to conduct a warrantless
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
arrest really we're just talking about
 
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor arrests here and I'll
 
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
explain why but the ability to conduct
 
01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:54.179 align:start position:0%
those arrests where there is actual or
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
threatened violence which I think is a
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
very important limitation the new
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
version that's before you strips away
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's that protection and that is the
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
core of my concerns and why I'm here
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
today because SB 58 as amended would
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
allow for a warrantless arrest for a
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
violation or misdemeanor offense in the
 
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
absence of any serious bodily injury
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
which is defined in law it's footnoted
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
in our testimony and also would allow
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
for a misdemeanor arrest with the
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
absence of any imminent threat to life
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
or property so I do want to say at the
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
outset when you look at our warrantless
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
arrest statute I've attached it to to my
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
testimony as well RSA 594 colon 10. it
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
allows for warrantless arrests
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
for offenses occurring outside the
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
officer's presence in in two situations
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
that I want to flag
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
the first is if there's serious bodily
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
injury because that would be a felony so
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's already covered under existing
 
01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.370 align:start position:0%
that's already covered under existing
law

01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
now in the absence of serious bodily
 
01:37:53.689 --> 01:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
injury what we're really talking about
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
here is is misdemeanor simple assault
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
a warrantless arrest can occur
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
um if without an arrest there's an
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
indication that that person will cause
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
further personal injury or damage to
 
01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
property so I just want to submit that I
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
do not think it is completely accurate
 
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
that nothing can be done in these
 
01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
situations that is the regime that we
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
currently have in law perhaps one of the
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
many solutions to this is just better
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
education with law enforcement of what
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
the parameters are for arrest and how
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
even with a misdemeanor simple assault
 
01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
there still is the ability to conduct a
 
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest again if you can show
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
or demonstrate by virtue of what was
 
01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
said or the assault itself that there is
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
a likelihood that there could be future
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
personal injury or damage to property
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
and I know the concern well that's
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's predictive how do police officers
 
01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
do that police officers respectfully
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
they do that all the time
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
um one example right is in the voluntary
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions context where law
 
01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Health Care staff even
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
will make the prediction that that
 
01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
person by virtue of what they have done
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
is likely in the future to be a danger
 
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
to themselves or others right so I think
 
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
this is this is part of the the general
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
law enforcement function already and of
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
course even without an arrest right law
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement can be present they can be
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
called and they can be there even in the
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
absence of a custodial arrest I know
 
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
obviously there are time limitations for
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but I just want a flag
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
that is still an option at the end of
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
but the the the for misdemeanors the
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
language and current law that there can
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
only be a warrantless arrest if there's
 
01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
likelihood of further personal injury
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
damage the property I just want to flag
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
that as a key civil liberties protection
 
01:39:42.169 --> 01:39:42.179 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day to make sure that
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
people are not needlessly detained
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
because our view is you know if law
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement want to arrest someone there
 
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
should the crime either needs to be
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
without a war it needs to be really
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
serious Allah serious bodily injury or
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
um there needs to be a likelihood of
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
future injury or damage the compromise
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
in the original version of SB 58 struck
 
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
that that balance and it did so by
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
having the language that foreign arrests
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
to occur warrantless arrests there must
 
01:40:09.890 --> 01:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
be actual or threatened violence while a
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
person is interfering in the provision
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
of medically necessary healthcare
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
services so you know maybe not perfect
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
to some but I felt like you know as an
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
ACLU lawyer as a civil libertarian like
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's close to
 
01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
providing some of those due process
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
protections but while Wrecking
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing the very real concerns that
 
01:40:32.689 --> 01:40:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
and I uh the the second point I just
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
like to make is I know obviously there's
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
a lot has been said about you know we're
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
not trying to criminalize
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
mental illness that's not the point of
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
this you know I'm a lawyer so I look at
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
the text
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
that may not be the intent I think that
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
is what will happen here
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
um you know there's nothing in the
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
language of the text of this bill that
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
says you know a person can only be
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
arrested if they're medically clear
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the text that says
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
um you know this isn't going to apply to
 
01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:02.699 align:start position:0%
people going through Mental Health
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
crisis I mean at its core this would
 
01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
allow for warrantless arrests for simple
 
01:41:10.129 --> 01:41:10.139 align:start position:0%
assaults absent any indication of future
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
harm and I just want to flag what a
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
simple assault is this unprivileged
 
01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:15.050 align:start position:0%
simple assault is this unprivileged
contact

01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
contact
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's what simple assaulted is in many
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
instances it can be severe to be sure
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
but in many instances it will not be
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
severe in what this bill allows is in in
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
all situations it provides as a tool the
 
01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:31.100 align:start position:0%
ability of that person without any
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
indication of future harm to be pulled
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
out of the health care center set
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
setting and now funneled into the
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system and I know that
 
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
we know with emergency room boarding
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
being as prevalent as it is I do think
 
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
that it is very likely that it is that
 
01:41:46.129 --> 01:41:46.139 align:start position:0%
subsection of individuals who are going
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
to be caught within the web of this new
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
particular regime
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
the last point I just want to make is
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
that unlike prior iterations of of this
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
bill this is kind of a unique regime in
 
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
that it is modifying a bill that deals
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
with Motion Picture theater owners and
 
01:42:02.159 --> 01:42:03.649 align:start position:0%
with Motion Picture theater owners and
Merchants

01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
Merchants
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
um which is I think very creative
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
um but this is very different the
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
hospital setting is very different from
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
Motion Picture theaters or from
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
um from Merchants so those statutes are
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with you know people kind of
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
sneaking their way into a movie theater
 
01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699 align:start position:0%
right or individual shoplifting we're
 
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
talking about Healthcare settings we're
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
talking about people who don't want to
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
flee or necessarily even evade they
 
01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
they're there to get health care so I
 
01:42:30.649 --> 01:42:30.659 align:start position:0%
just think the context is fundamentally
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
different and I think assault is
 
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
different than shoplifting I think it's
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
just it's harder to kind of the legal
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
permutations are just kind of
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
different but I also think what the
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
statute does too is give Hospital
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
workers themselves the ability to detain
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
which is you know pretty significant
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
increase in Authority I'm not sure that
 
01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
was contemplated or that hospitals even
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%
want that but I do want to flag that
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
particular issue in this particular in
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
this bill as well so with that I know I
 
01:43:00.169 --> 01:43:00.179 align:start position:0%
spoke a lot but I just wanted to flag
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
these concerns again my recommendation
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
would be the original version of sb58
 
01:43:08.689 --> 01:43:08.699 align:start position:0%
with the the caveats or the the small
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
modification that Senator Rosenwald
 
01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
submitted we would have no objection to
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
that again because we were involved in
 
01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
negotiating it thank you
 
01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
I kind of have two things so
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
I hear you wanting to protect the civil
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
liberties of the patients what about the
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
civil liberties
 
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
of the health care workers it's okay for
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
them to get groped and and just beat up
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
a little bit no I'm asking a question oh
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry I didn't interrupt you no
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
you're okay
 
01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
no it's absolutely inappropriate so and
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
they can't they can be arrested and they
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
should be arrested what we're talking
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
about here is a warrantless arrest right
 
01:43:52.129 --> 01:43:52.139 align:start position:0%
so the point that I'm trying to make
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
here is whether someone is arrested on
 
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
the spot or not that person can't and
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
maybe even should be charged what this
 
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to get at is that kind of
 
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
X and GC of oh we need to we need to
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
immediately get in and extract that
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
person because there's an urgent harm
 
01:44:09.169 --> 01:44:09.179 align:start position:0%
right if that's what we're trying to get
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
at the language of the bill needs to be
 
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
clear to specify that if we're going to
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
allow for a warrantless arrest there
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be exigency in the in SB 58 the
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
original version it was through actual
 
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
threatened or physical violence what
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it strips that away
 
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
right it allows for a warrantless arrest
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
even when there is no indicia reasonable
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
indicia that there is likely to be a
 
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
danger to property or a person in the
 
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
future and I think that to me is the
 
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
core and the balance that I'm trying to
 
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
strike here is
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know allowing for those arrests
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
without a warrant when there's exigency
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
um you know because that's critical I
 
01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
think to protect Hospital safety but at
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
the same time trying to make sure people
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
aren't needlessly detained when there
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
isn't an exigency particularly when
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a concern that those
 
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
people that may get swept up within this
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
regime are undergoing a mental health
 
01:45:04.199 --> 01:45:09.530 align:start position:0%
regime are undergoing a mental health
crisis

01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Hayden Phillips
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.810 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
um Mr Bissonnet so I'm looking at the
 
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
original language of SB 58 before the
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment took place and I'm just
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
going to ask you a little simple
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
question about the threshold that is now
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
reasonable grounds but before was
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
um probable cause and
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
what does that lowered threshold in your
 
01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:35.870 align:start position:0%
what does that lowered threshold in your
opinion

01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
um you know pose for
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the determination of whether
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
or not someone's actually violated
 
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
um you know any sort of
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh clause in the new law that might
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
cause them to be warrantlessly arrested
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the language beer
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
with you real quick representative
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
so the the the question has to do with
 
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
the the probable cause language
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
Pro that the the police officer has
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
probable cause and then going down on SB
 
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
58 as introduced that while in the care
 
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
that the uh through actual or threatened
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
violence the person will interfere
 
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the problem so I I
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
don't I haven't viewed the probable
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
cause piece frankly as really a material
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
a material change that it is another way
 
01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
of to some extent reframing existing law
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
but doing so in the context of Hospital
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
settings in particular in recognition of
 
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
the concerns that they raise that are
 
01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
real and that have some data to to back
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
them up so I I don't think that standard
 
01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh it is not something that has
 
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
concerned me because I haven't viewed it
 
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
as being
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
that much of a material change relative
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
to existing law I think the bottom
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
language in bold that is kind of the
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
material change that's designed to to
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
reflect the the concerns of healthcare
 
01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:01.790 align:start position:0%
reflect the the concerns of healthcare
workers

01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
okay good morning chairman Roy members
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%

Dodd I'm the chief nursing officer for
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Regional Hospital I come
 
01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
before you today in support of Senate
 
01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
bill 58. it's going to read I've also
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
passed out a short copy of my testimony
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
our team is comprised composed excuse me
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
of dedicated Health Care Professionals
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
who chose a career of service to our
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
community they proudly show up every day
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
to save lives and care for the patients
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
we serve the pandemic accelerated what
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
was a Workforce shortage into a
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce crisis in addition to that as
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard this morning over and over
 
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
again we now have a significant increase
 
01:48:06.649 --> 01:48:06.659 align:start position:0%
in workplace violence that our teams
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
have to face in 2022 our facility alone
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
saw 58 employees physically injured
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
from trying to care for their patients
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
this year we've already had 13.
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
and to be clear these are not minor
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
injuries they are punched bitten
 
01:48:28.370 --> 01:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
scratched choked have equipment thrown
 
01:48:29.209 --> 01:48:29.219 align:start position:0%
at them
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
we had one employee who suffered
 
01:48:33.649 --> 01:48:33.659 align:start position:0%
fractured orbital bones we have another
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
employee who has permanent hearing loss
 
01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
from being hit in the head
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
we had one patient who injured six
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
employees in two days
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
and we had a medical patient who injured
 
01:48:48.530 --> 01:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
two employees in in one day
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
and of course many of you have heard
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
from The Assault um our frisbee sister
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
Hospital of Richard Simo who
 
01:48:57.169 --> 01:48:57.179 align:start position:0%
unfortunately died and that incident had
 
01:48:59.330 --> 01:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
a very deep impact on all of us in our
 
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.649 align:start position:0%
a very deep impact on all of us in our
community

01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
as you've also heard this morning in
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
order to recruit and retain staff our
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
employees have to feel safe
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
they have to feel safe while they're
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
delivering the calm and empathetic care
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
that they show up to provide and
 
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
remember that as we rebuild this
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
Workforce our nurses our new graduates
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
they are young they're at the beginning
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
of their career and for them to come in
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
every day and have fear and and watch
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
these events happen and wonder is that
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
going to happen to me am I going to have
 
01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:30.179 align:start position:0%
a permanent injury this young in my
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
career that's not okay
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
um this bill provides a critical tool in
 
01:49:37.010 --> 01:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
our opinion to our law enforcement
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
Partners to support us with their
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
partnership we believe that we can
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
reduce the number and severity of
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
injuries to our staff and ultimately
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
create a safer environment for our
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
health care workers and our patients so
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
as such I ask you to support SB 58 I'm
 
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
if I could um the incident you said
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
where the patient assaulted a number of
 
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
employees the same patient did
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
how would this statute have stopped that
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
was that person admitted how did that
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
come to be sure in that situation if
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
this statute was in place our partners
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
and police would have been able to as
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
you've heard this morning show up and
 
01:50:20.209 --> 01:50:20.219 align:start position:0%
help us assess that situation I do want
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
to also add that I believe that as you
 
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
also heard from Dr Grossman that our
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
providers and our nurses Advocate very
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
strongly despite this for our patients
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
so I believe that they would partner
 
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
with that patient and help decide what's
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
best in this case they they couldn't
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's what you've heard this morning
 
01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:37.139 align:start position:0%
there was nothing they could do because
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
they didn't witness it and so that
 
01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
continued and continued and we were
 
01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
limited our team was limited on what
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
they could do despite all the training
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
that we provide we we're certainly
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
compliant with the laws that have come
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
out and we had that in place before that
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
happened because that empowers our team
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
to be safe as safe as we can make them
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot that they can't do
 
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
that our police Partners can do to help
 
01:50:59.930 --> 01:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
partner with us in that case in this
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
case this patient ultimately was taken
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
to jail but after many many injuries and
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
many many requests from all of us on the
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
admin team standing side by side with
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
our Frontline staff to include Dr
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
Grossman as you heard watching this
 
01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
happen going please you've got to help
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
protect our staff
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
was that patient admitted why was he
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
there so long I guess sure he actually
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
was waiting for a psych placement in
 
01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
this particular case he actually did
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
very very well for quite a long time and
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
then he had an incident with one of his
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
family members that he just snapped and
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
became quite violent towards everybody
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
and ultimately was taken
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
so was the involuntary commitment
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
procedure initiated against that patient
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
and does your hospital have a secure
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
facility to hold patients that are we do
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
have a pod in our ER if we need to yeah
 
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
in this case he could not have been with
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
any other patient that's how violent the
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
one patient was okay
 
01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:57.179 align:start position:0%
representative salic thank you Mr chair
 
01:51:59.330 --> 01:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
my question is very brief
 
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious whether you're speaking
 
01:52:02.689 --> 01:52:02.699 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill it was as it was
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
originally written or as it was amended
 
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.209 --> 01:52:11.219 align:start position:0%
every testimony thank you
 
01:52:23.590 --> 01:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Karen Rosenberg from
 
01:52:27.649 --> 01:52:27.659 align:start position:0%
the disability rights Center I'm the
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
policy director but I've been at the
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
organization previously as a staff
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
attorney for about almost 18 years
 
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here um to testify against SB
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
58 as amended by the Senate although I
 
01:52:43.729 --> 01:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
understand we're for safety in our
 
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
health care is a Paramount importance
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
really I mean we want our clients to be
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
able to be safe when they get treatment
 
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
that means we need Workforce to be safe
 
01:52:56.689 --> 01:52:56.699 align:start position:0%
but this bill does not solve that
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
problem and in fact it could make things
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
worse at our hospitals and I'm going to
 
01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
talk to you about some of the situations
 
01:53:05.209 --> 01:53:05.219 align:start position:0%
that we hear about because I think this
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
is about criminalizing Mental Health and
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
I also want to talk about some of the
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm handing out to you are two laws
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
of Federal Regulation which could be
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
Implement implicated if this should pass
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
as well as our state patient's Bill of
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
Rights which could also be implicated if
 
01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
this bill should pass as amended
 
01:53:26.689 --> 01:53:26.699 align:start position:0%
our office regularly hears from people
 
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
with mental illness who are facing
 
01:53:34.729 --> 01:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
lengthy stays mostly at EDS who are
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
either i.ea in the process of being iea
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know involuntarily admitted due to
 
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
being in a mental health crisis
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
I've consulted with some of the staff
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys with my office to give you
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
some recent examples of how who these
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
people are and how their behaviors could
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
result in them being deferred to the
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system instead of
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
getting medically necessary Services
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
because remember what we're talking
 
01:54:03.649 --> 01:54:03.659 align:start position:0%
about here are misdemeanor offenses that
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
would justify a warrantless arrest we're
 
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
not talking about a felony we're not
 
01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:11.219 align:start position:0%
talking about them not getting arrested
 
01:54:13.609 --> 01:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
at all but how it is that someone with
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
mental illness could end up in a
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
situation where they're diverted
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily to a county jail or to the
 
01:54:21.719 --> 01:54:22.490 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily to a county jail or to the
court

01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:54:26.209 --> 01:54:26.219 align:start position:0%
so one example I have is a woman who had
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
previously experienced numerous sexual
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
assaults and when she was brought into
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital generally what happens is
 
01:54:38.209 --> 01:54:38.219 align:start position:0%
there's a a safety call from a neighbor
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
or a family member she was in a mental
 
01:54:43.729 --> 01:54:43.739 align:start position:0%
health crisis the police come they cuff
 
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
her like they do with most people throw
 
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
her into the film not throw her but put
 
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
her into the back of a police cruiser
 
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
take her to a hospital that is really
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
not staffed to meet her needs her
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
clothing is removed her phone is removed
 
01:54:59.530 --> 01:54:59.540 align:start position:0%
she isn't allowed to have no personal
 
01:55:01.729 --> 01:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
objects at all she's put in a room with
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
nothing not a television not a book
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
nothing nothing to do to distract her
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
anyway so this particular person was
 
01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
really really agitated
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
like I said history of sexual abuse by
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
men so you know she's thrashing and
 
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
screaming and hitting walls and
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
eventually a staff male staff comes in
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
to try to restrain her well this
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
exacerbated the situation for her so yes
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
she's flailing and makes contact with
 
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
that staff member person wasn't injured
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
seriously I don't even know if that
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
person suffered a bruise however if this
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass that would be
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
considered a simple assault that could
 
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
result in an arrest without a warrant
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
and trans you know and diversion from
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
treatment to court and to jail and all
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
of it another
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
um woman we heard about a lot someone
 
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
who they you know there's an iea in
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
place it had been granted she'd been
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
waiting boarding for about a week
 
01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and involuntary medication was
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
authorized the medications delivered
 
01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
intravenously and so this person called
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
us to report that in in administering
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
that medication what the nurse did was
 
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
like Ripper you know bottoms off and
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
shove the needle into her leg well her
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
reflexive action in that instance she
 
01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
didn't want the medication again flail
 
01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
this is how someone could get hit and
 
01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
again that would be a simple assault
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
assuming the person didn't suffer a
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
serious this injury could result in a
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest Interruption of
 
01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
treatment transferred to a jail
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
transferred to court
 
01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:41.030 align:start position:0%
transferred to court
um

01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know we hear I mean repeatedly we've
 
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
heard about things like people who are
 
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
iea boarding you know experiencing a
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
crisis hearing voices not getting
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
treatment pacing and you know so that
 
01:56:57.590 --> 01:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard about people banging their
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
heads against walls punching walls if a
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
staff member were to intervene to try to
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
prevent them from hurting themselves
 
01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's well intentioned I mean you don't
 
01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
want the patient to hurt themselves but
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
if they get in between the patient's
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
head and the wall and get bashed by the
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
patient again maybe the person doesn't
 
01:57:16.609 --> 01:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
suffer a serious injury do we want that
 
01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
person carded away to uh you know to a
 
01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
jail to a to a judge to a court system
 
01:57:25.609 --> 01:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
when really what they need is treatment
 
01:57:27.649 --> 01:57:27.659 align:start position:0%
these are the kinds of things that we
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
hear about and that are really
 
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:30.659 align:start position:0%
concerning to us because in each of
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
these instances that I've described
 
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
those patients were if they were I I'm
 
01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
not aware that they were even arrested
 
01:57:40.129 --> 01:57:40.139 align:start position:0%
but if there was a need to arrest them
 
01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
they could be arrested just not without
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
a warrant and their treatment wouldn't
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
have been interrupted
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
putting this aside however the other
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
thing that this bill does as amended is
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
that it deputizes people who work in
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare situations to physically
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
detain their patients even if those
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
patients aren't necessarily presenting a
 
01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:02.510 align:start position:0%
patients aren't necessarily presenting a
danger

01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
danger
 
01:58:05.410 --> 01:58:05.420 align:start position:0%
and this is very concerning one I think
 
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
in my colleague from the ACLU Jill
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
Bissonnet provided you with an excerpt
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
or maybe even the whole report that the
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
study committee came out with and one of
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
their primary findings was that before
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
that really de-escalation is Paramount
 
01:58:23.209 --> 01:58:23.219 align:start position:0%
in terms of managing escalated behaviors
 
01:58:25.629 --> 01:58:25.639 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
encouraging doing anything to encourage
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers to physically detain
 
01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
someone beyond the time when they
 
01:58:35.089 --> 01:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
present an emergency or oppose a risk of
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
bodily harm to themselves or others
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's only going to escalate the
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
situation it's not going to de-escalate
 
01:58:45.169 --> 01:58:45.179 align:start position:0%
the situation and so it you know it
 
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
thereby would then put healthcare
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
workers in Peril it also could implicate
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation and our state law and
 
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
so that's what I handed out to you so
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
with respect to hospitals
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
um the centers for Medicare Medicaid
 
01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:03.179 align:start position:0%
services CMS has a regulation that
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
provides conditions for approval to
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
receive medicare and medicaid patients
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
um payments and so I've provided that to
 
01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
you and if you look at and that's um 42
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
CFR 42 13.
 
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
on page two of the document I gave you
 
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
it's highlighted it provides restrain or
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
seclusion may only be imposed to ensure
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
the immediate physical safety of the
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
patient a staff member or others and
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
must be discontinued at the earliest
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
possible time
 
01:59:36.010 --> 01:59:36.020 align:start position:0%
so if Hospital Personnel were to
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
literally hold on to someone who they
 
01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:41.820 align:start position:0%
suspected may have caused engaged in a
 
01:59:42.890 --> 01:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
simple assault something that would
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
justify a warrantless arrest under this
 
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
bill Beyond and wait for them to a
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
police officer to come and the person's
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
calm That Could That Could implicate
 
01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
their ability to secure Federal Medicaid
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
and Medicare reimbursement something is
 
02:00:00.169 --> 02:00:00.179 align:start position:0%
really important obviously to the
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
financial stability of our health care
 
02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:04.669 align:start position:0%
financial stability of our health care
institutions

02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
um now it should be noted that restraint
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
and seclusion are permitted when the
 
02:00:13.490 --> 02:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
patient does
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
um present a risk of serous bodily harm
 
02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not that they can't do
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
that already they have the tools they
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
can do that but it needs to be stopped
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
as soon as that person no longer
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
presents a risk and we don't want I
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
think passing a law that would basically
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
incentivize in some way holding a
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
patient until they can be arrested
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
without a warrant is ill-advised
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
I also want to turn your attention to
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's patients Bill of Rights
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
so I provided you with a copy of that
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
and if you go to page two I've
 
02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
highlighted the portion on patients
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
rights with regard to restraint and
 
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
seclusion again similar to the federal
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
law now the federal law that I sent
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
provided only applies to hospitals New
 
02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's patients Bill of Rights
 
02:00:59.810 --> 02:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
applies to all Health Care Facilities
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
not just hospitals and what this
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
provides is that
 
02:01:05.810 --> 02:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
patients are supposed to be free from
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
chemical and physical restraint except
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
when they're authorized in writing by a
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
physician now that can be a retroactive
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
authorization just to be clear but only
 
02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
for a specific limited time necessary to
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
protect the patient or others from
 
02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:20.030 align:start position:0%
protect the patient or others from
injury

02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
injury
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
again once the risk is no longer present
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
those efforts need to cease failure to
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
do so is a violation of the patient's
 
02:01:32.089 --> 02:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
rights under this law which are
 
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
enforceable in our courts so I also
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
provided you with the last page of that
 
02:01:36.239 --> 02:01:37.729 align:start position:0%
provided you with the last page of that
document

02:01:37.729 --> 02:01:37.739 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
um RSA 15130 is the section of our law
 
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
that provides that there is a right to
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
Equitable relief and damages for
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
violations of our patients Bill of
 
02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:48.530 align:start position:0%
violations of our patients Bill of
Rights

02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
encouraging health care workers to hold
 
02:01:52.810 --> 02:01:52.820 align:start position:0%
on to someone longer than necessary
 
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
potentially puts them in a situation
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
where they could run afoul of a
 
02:01:59.089 --> 02:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
patient's rights under our patient's
 
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
so for all these reasons I think that
 
02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
this effort is really not not advisable
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
our office also worked with
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders the law enforcement
 
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
ACLU Nami New Hampshire Hospital
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
Association on the bill as it was
 
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
introduced you know originally and we
 
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
were okay with it because what it did
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
was it made it clear that we're talking
 
02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
about warrant the use of warrantless
 
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
arrest the concept of warrantless arrest
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
is insist in situations where there's
 
02:02:34.089 --> 02:02:34.099 align:start position:0%
some edges exigency never say that word
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
and it's really to to say in a
 
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor kind of situation this is
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about misdemeanors
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
that where there's a likelihood that the
 
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
person's going to flee they're going to
 
02:02:49.010 --> 02:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
destroy evidence and or as introduced in
 
02:02:50.689 --> 02:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
this bill they're going to interfere
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
with the medically necessary treatment
 
02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
of themselves or others
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of exception that GRC
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
could be okay with but as written now
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
there's none of that protection we're
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
deputizing Health Care Personnel to
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
exceed what they're permitted to do
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
under our state and in federal
 
02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
regulations in some instances and I
 
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
don't think this is the solution to
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
protect our health care Workforce I'm
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
ITT Zone never mind go skip
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions no further
 
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee you sure
 
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
you ain't got that one
 
02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:39.950 align:start position:0%
you ain't got that one
okay

02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman uh members of
 
02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Gary app fell
 
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer practicing in private
 
02:04:15.070 --> 02:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
practice in Lebanon New Hampshire
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
I am a member of the board of directors
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association of
 
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers and I appear
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
representing the association
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
preliminarily I would say that I know
 
02:04:28.250 --> 02:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
that I'm in trouble when I'm on the same
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
side of a bill as the law enforcement
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
officer who's testified before me
 
02:04:36.609 --> 02:04:36.619 align:start position:0%
so I say that somewhat in jest
 
02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
this statute is well-intentioned but it
 
02:04:43.490 --> 02:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
and I've been listening to the testimony
 
02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
this morning it does not achieve the
 
02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
results that the Senate sought
 
02:04:53.169 --> 02:04:53.179 align:start position:0%
and it creates a host of new problems
 
02:04:56.450 --> 02:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
that I want to bring to your attention
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
so I'd ask you to Envision the following
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
situation under the statute as it's
 
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
proposed to you
 
02:05:06.970 --> 02:05:06.980 align:start position:0%
so a husband and wife are in a hospital
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
in the hallway they're arguing
 
02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh a licensed nursing assistant
 
02:05:17.209 --> 02:05:17.219 align:start position:0%
overhears and approaches
 
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
the L A doesn't know what the argument
 
02:05:21.169 --> 02:05:21.179 align:start position:0%
was about
 
02:05:24.890 --> 02:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
the LNA does not interview the husband
 
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
he knows nothing about The credibility
 
02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
of either party
 
02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
the wife says only I was threatened by
 
02:05:35.410 --> 02:05:35.420 align:start position:0%
my husband before you showed up
 
02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
and the LNA doesn't investigate whether
 
02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
or not the wife has a motive to make a
 
02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
false accusation
 
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
and then he arrests and physically
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
detains the husband
 
02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
under the statute is proposed that would
 
02:05:50.570 --> 02:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
be legal
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be constitutional as I'll
 
02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
talk about in a minute but it would be
 
02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is that it grants
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
powers of arrest that are denied to Law
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers pursuant to RSA 594
 
02:06:05.639 --> 02:06:07.370 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers pursuant to RSA 594
10.

02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
10.
 
02:06:09.649 --> 02:06:09.659 align:start position:0%
um and I'd ask you to look at that
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
statute as you're considering your
 
02:06:12.119 --> 02:06:13.430 align:start position:0%
statute as you're considering your
deliberations

02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:06:17.390 --> 02:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I suspect that representative pru in
 
02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
particular will have questions for me
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
about that and I I hope to be able to
 
02:06:22.570 --> 02:06:22.580 align:start position:0%
address them
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
it also uh so and if you if you look at
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
594 10
 
02:06:28.679 --> 02:06:29.270 align:start position:0%
594 10
.

02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
.
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't say that a warrantless
 
02:06:33.649 --> 02:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
arrest is okay by law enforcement
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
officer for a criminal threatening case
 
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
I think you just heard attorney Rosen
 
02:06:41.089 --> 02:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
well talk about uh accident
 
02:06:43.490 --> 02:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
circumstances and that's important the
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
other thing is if you look at our
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest statute it requires
 
02:06:50.209 --> 02:06:50.219 align:start position:0%
probable cause which this detainment
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
statute does not require it only
 
02:06:54.530 --> 02:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
requires what we would technically use
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
in in the criminal justice world is a
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
term of reasonable suspicion
 
02:07:02.089 --> 02:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
with all respect have Mr Bissonnet um
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
and I I uh I mentioned this to him when
 
02:07:06.649 --> 02:07:06.659 align:start position:0%
he finished testifying and he asked me
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
to clarify or explain when I testified
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference between
 
02:07:14.689 --> 02:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Suspicion and probable cause
 
02:07:14.699 --> 02:07:16.209 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Suspicion and probable cause
so

02:07:16.209 --> 02:07:16.219 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
what the founders of our country and in
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
general and and here in New Hampshire in
 
02:07:25.609 --> 02:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
particular worried about was that in
 
02:07:27.770 --> 02:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
colonial days that the king and his men
 
02:07:31.250 --> 02:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
could arrest people and search them or
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
their possessions without a warrant and
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
without justification
 
02:07:39.410 --> 02:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
so in both the State Constitution and
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution we have
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
requirements of
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh a warrant and a probable cause
 
02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
determination made by made by a neutral
 
02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
individual somebody who's not involved
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
in the situation
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
um and that was to protect
 
02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:56.450 align:start position:0%
um and that was to protect
um

02:07:56.450 --> 02:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:58.010 align:start position:0%
um
people

02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
um from being hauled off to jail when
 
02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
they there wasn't really just cause to
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
do that there had to be some some stop
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
Gap there it's just like we have grand
 
02:08:09.050 --> 02:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
juries here in New Hampshire because we
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't want people forced to go to trial
 
02:08:13.010 --> 02:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
on a felony when it's totally baseless
 
02:08:15.050 --> 02:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
we have some various protections for
 
02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:16.310 align:start position:0%
we have some various protections for
that

02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:18.530 --> 02:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
now obviously there are times when it
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to make someone wait
 
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
and go and get a warrant and that's
 
02:08:25.850 --> 02:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
actually to the circumstances and we
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
already have in 594 10 an example of
 
02:08:30.589 --> 02:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
that which is a domestic violence
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
situation within 12 hours of when the
 
02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
act happened
 
02:08:36.490 --> 02:08:36.500 align:start position:0%
and you certainly could as a legislature
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
put in that statute a similar provision
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
allowing for warrantless arrests under
 
02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances for things that
 
02:08:45.290 --> 02:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
are happening in hospitals
 
02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
the statute here doesn't do that
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
indeed as it's written the health care
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
provider can detain someone and then the
 
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
officer still would not have Authority
 
02:08:55.490 --> 02:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
Under the statute to arrest that person
 
02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
without a warrant
 
02:08:59.570 --> 02:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't achieve what it is that
 
02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
folks I think are trying to get to here
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
which is the very real need that we need
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
to protect our health care providers but
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
this statute simply doesn't do that it
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent people from being
 
02:09:13.129 --> 02:09:13.139 align:start position:0%
charged from crime still if it's
 
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to charge them and it
 
02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow for their detention any
 
02:09:17.689 --> 02:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
quicker ultimately by a law enforcement
 
02:09:17.699 --> 02:09:18.830 align:start position:0%
quicker ultimately by a law enforcement
officer

02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
officer
 
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
so we need to ask ourselves what are we
 
02:09:22.850 --> 02:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
doing here
 
02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
I would also note that while I hear from
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony today that Health Care
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
providers are getting more training that
 
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
may have been true in the past it is
 
02:09:37.609 --> 02:09:37.619 align:start position:0%
inconceivable to me as someone who works
 
02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
with police officers and with staff at
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
the house of correction at the prison
 
02:09:44.089 --> 02:09:44.099 align:start position:0%
day in and day out that they have
 
02:09:46.129 --> 02:09:46.139 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the same level of training
 
02:09:47.689 --> 02:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
and experience as law enforcement
 
02:09:47.699 --> 02:09:49.370 align:start position:0%
and experience as law enforcement
officers

02:09:49.370 --> 02:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
officers
 
02:09:51.229 --> 02:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
those officers receive extensive
 
02:09:52.609 --> 02:09:52.619 align:start position:0%
training before being allowed to make
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
arrest of Annie Stewart
 
02:09:57.169 --> 02:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
as you heard from superintendent Henry
 
02:09:59.209 --> 02:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
they trained for months at the police
 
02:09:59.219 --> 02:10:00.169 align:start position:0%
they trained for months at the police
academy

02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
academy
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
they work with field training officers
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
they have ongoing training and refresher
 
02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:07.010 align:start position:0%
they have ongoing training and refresher
courses

02:10:07.010 --> 02:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
courses
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers also receive
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
another type of training that Healthcare
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
professionals do not receive
 
02:10:16.010 --> 02:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
they are trained
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
in investigation and to make arrests no
 
02:10:22.850 --> 02:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
arrest decisions that includes factual
 
02:10:25.609 --> 02:10:25.619 align:start position:0%
investigation that includes credibility
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
determinations that includes training in
 
02:10:30.649 --> 02:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
substantive law
 
02:10:33.169 --> 02:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
it includes far more extensive training
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
and appropriate use of levels of force
 
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
and I suspect that even with current
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
training that it includes much more
 
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
training about de-escalation of
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
potential violence
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and it's not its
 
02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.229 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and it's not its
intent

02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
but it legalizes vigilanteism
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
it encourages spur of the moment
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
decision making by non-professionals and
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
I mean Professionals in the sense of
 
02:10:59.810 --> 02:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice System not they're
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
obviously Professionals in the realm of
 
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
providing Health Care
 
02:11:05.689 --> 02:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
and it allows the use of physical Force
 
02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
without any required training at least
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
under the language of the statute
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%
the bill also invites potential violence
 
02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
individuals and I'm talking about
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
patients or family members or other
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
people who are in hospitals inevitably
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
will not recognize the arrest powers of
 
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
Health Care providers
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
some authorized detainers
 
02:11:29.639 --> 02:11:31.089 align:start position:0%
some authorized detainers
um

02:11:31.089 --> 02:11:31.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:33.709 --> 02:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
any of these Health Care Providers may
 
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
use excessive force
 
02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
because again they won't have the same
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
training and understand what that is
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
some authorized detainers may use or
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
threaten the use of weapons
 
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
and some individuals will seek and
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
receive aid from others to prevent
 
02:11:48.599 --> 02:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
receive aid from others to prevent
detention

02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
you need only look at recent history of
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
the terrible results under somewhat
 
02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
similar circumstances around this
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
country about citizens who are making
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement decisions on their own
 
02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
just in the past week there was a
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
shooting of a 16 year old Ralph yarl but
 
02:12:16.609 --> 02:12:16.619 align:start position:0%
an 84 year old homeowner the homeowner
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
was clearly fearful for his own safety
 
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
whether that was justified or not the
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
court system will need to decide
 
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
but it was reinforced by a law
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
in Missouri that is basically a stand
 
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
your ground statute
 
02:12:32.689 --> 02:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
if you look what happened in Georgia a
 
02:12:34.330 --> 02:12:34.340 align:start position:0%
couple years ago with the murder of
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
Ahmad Aubry that was a runner who was
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
killed by men trying to stop someone who
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
they believed was engaged in
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
burglarizing homes
 
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
if you look what happened in Florida
 
02:12:46.450 --> 02:12:46.460 align:start position:0%
with Trayvon Martin
 
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
he was killed at the hands of a zealous
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
the workplace violence that has been
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
talked about today is a huge problem
 
02:13:00.649 --> 02:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
and I'm as much supportive of our Health
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
Care Professionals receiving the support
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
they need
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
I also sometimes my primary work is
 
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
doing criminal defense work but in my 34
 
02:13:11.689 --> 02:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
years of practice I've represented
 
02:13:15.229 --> 02:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh victims of crime I've represented
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
mentally ill people I represented Jane
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
Doe before the New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
Court last year with the involuntary
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
emergency admission case where she was
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
illegally detained at Dartmouth
 
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock for 21 days and only released
 
02:13:29.209 --> 02:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
because they filed the habeas corpus
 
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
petition the Grafton County Superior
 
02:13:32.689 --> 02:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
Court were not released but then sent to
 
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital where they
 
02:13:35.209 --> 02:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
then had to go to court again to get her
 
02:13:35.219 --> 02:13:36.050 align:start position:0%
then had to go to court again to get her
out

02:13:36.050 --> 02:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm really sensitive to the needs of
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
victims I'm sensitive to the needs of
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
mentally ill people
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
I know that when I was for six years a
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
member of the board of directors of the
 
02:13:47.209 --> 02:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center we were
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
addressing these sorts of concerns as
 
02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.870 align:start position:0%
addressing these sorts of concerns as
well

02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
um and we need our health care providers
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
to be safe but this doesn't make them
 
02:13:56.639 --> 02:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
to be safe but this doesn't make them
safe

02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
safe
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's it is unfortunately a feel-good
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
statute that is not going to de-escalate
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
the level of violence in in a society
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
that is far too drawn to violence and
 
02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:08.270 align:start position:0%
that is far too drawn to violence and
anger

02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
anger
 
02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and it's only going to make us less
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
safe it's non-constitutional and as the
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
language is written down now
 
02:14:18.649 --> 02:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
um it will surely be struck down by the
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
um I at this point I I would stop and
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
address any questions you might have
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
including if you want I don't want to go
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
too much longer I'm happy to explain
 
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
more about the difference between
 
02:14:29.930 --> 02:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Suspicion and probable cause
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
if you want me to elaborate well I think
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
the committee is pretty aware of that
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
um representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted you to I wrote it
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
down here but I'm not sure I got it
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
right is the statute that you referenced
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of your testimony 594
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
colon 10. that is correct thank you
 
02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:51.229 align:start position:0%
colon 10. that is correct thank you
no

02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:14:53.709 --> 02:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
I just uh want to clarify people
 
02:14:59.810 --> 02:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
mentioned the bill and so we have a bill
 
02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
that was the original Bill and then we
 
02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
have a bill that was amended by the as
 
02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate and then we have a
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
bill to be amended by a proposed
 
02:15:12.169 --> 02:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
amendment that would take it back to the
 
02:15:13.850 --> 02:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
exact original language of the bill
 
02:15:15.770 --> 02:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
which of those bills are you for or
 
02:15:19.129 --> 02:15:19.139 align:start position:0%
against yeah I'm afraid I have egg on my
 
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
face the only version of the bill I'm
 
02:15:23.089 --> 02:15:23.099 align:start position:0%
aware of is the one that was on the
 
02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
table this morning and that's the one
 
02:15:27.050 --> 02:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
that when I became aware of it last week
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
that I made the decision to come here
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
and testify
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
so um that language
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
is uh it's really in section three and
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
it's an amendment to uh
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
the detainment statute uh 627 8A so just
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
just to clarify you don't have the other
 
02:15:49.250 --> 02:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
information in so we'll have to
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
straighten that out and figure out which
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
this is thank you very much I don't and
 
02:15:53.569 --> 02:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
I apologize for that but is the language
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
now just to be clear that I'm referring
 
02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
to is about health care providers or
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
their agents being authorized to detain
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
people thank you very much
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
yes um and that situation as well but I
 
02:16:07.129 --> 02:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
I don't see that as embolded language
 
02:16:09.649 --> 02:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
was that already the law okay so
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
something else Yeah okay or it's a
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
different statue
 
02:16:13.199 --> 02:16:14.629 align:start position:0%
different statue
um representative

02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I just want to ask
 
02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
you a question about your earlier
 
02:16:23.209 --> 02:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
testimony about the LNA scenario with
 
02:16:25.250 --> 02:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
the husband and wife in the hallway and
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
as I'm reading this bill
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
it specifically says against a health
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
care provider or a patient actively
 
02:16:35.209 --> 02:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
receiving treatment by a health care
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
provider so that scenario
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
would not happen that LNA would not be
 
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
justified in taking any action am I
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
correct I respectfully disagree so
 
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
someone comes in they're initially
 
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
screened they're told to wait so they
 
02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
can get further care
 
02:16:52.730 --> 02:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
um and they get in an argument while
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
they're waiting that that clearly would
 
02:16:57.410 --> 02:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
be within the grounds of the statute and
 
02:16:59.209 --> 02:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
certainly I know prosecutors who would
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:04.849 --> 02:17:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you did you have a question oh
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.519 --> 02:17:16.549 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:20.509 --> 02:17:20.519 align:start position:0%
do you actually think that that LNA has
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
the time to care about what that husband
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
and wife are arguing and first of all
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
they don't have arrest powers
 
02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
right unless they're being attacked as
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
well so let me I think there's two parts
 
02:17:37.129 --> 02:17:37.139 align:start position:0%
to that question so the first is
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
02:17:42.290 --> 02:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
do I think that an LNA has time right
 
02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
and I would address that two ways
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh I certainly think that some people do
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
not but I do think that others do and if
 
02:17:53.089 --> 02:17:53.099 align:start position:0%
there's a loud a verbal argument going
 
02:17:54.889 --> 02:17:54.899 align:start position:0%
on in a hallway and the first person on
 
02:17:56.690 --> 02:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
the scene happens to be an LNA that
 
02:17:58.490 --> 02:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
person might get involved and I've
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
certainly had cases in my experience
 
02:18:03.530 --> 02:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
where people are Good Samaritans and
 
02:18:04.730 --> 02:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
trying to do what they can to be
 
02:18:06.310 --> 02:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
involved so I think that that's possible
 
02:18:09.469 --> 02:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
and more importantly you as a committee
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
and the uh the house as a legislative
 
02:18:14.750 --> 02:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
body needs to be concerned about what
 
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
statutes authorize not just what is
 
02:18:20.810 --> 02:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
likely to happen most of the time so you
 
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
should consider tightening up the
 
02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:23.389 align:start position:0%
should consider tightening up the
language

02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
um because as it reads now it's too
 
02:18:28.370 --> 02:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
broad and it invites those sorts of
 
02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:29.889 align:start position:0%
broad and it invites those sorts of
things

02:18:29.889 --> 02:18:29.899 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
the the second thing I would say is is
 
02:18:32.519 --> 02:18:34.009 align:start position:0%
the the second thing I would say is is
that

02:18:34.009 --> 02:18:34.019 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:36.290 --> 02:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
we can quibble about words about
 
02:18:38.589 --> 02:18:38.599 align:start position:0%
detention versus arrest
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
but what we're talking about and if you
 
02:18:43.009 --> 02:18:43.019 align:start position:0%
look at the both the United States
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and the New Hampshire
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's law on the law of
 
02:18:47.929 --> 02:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
seizure because we make all these fine
 
02:18:49.849 --> 02:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
line distinctions between seizure and
 
02:18:51.290 --> 02:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
formal arrest
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
the point is it's a restriction on
 
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
someone's movement so that person's not
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
free to leave
 
02:18:58.730 --> 02:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
and that has constitutional implications
 
02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
and it needs to for all of us as
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
Citizens because we normally assume that
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
we can go about in our own way and do
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
what we want to do and now we're saying
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
that somebody else without personal
 
02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
knowledge because that's the way the
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
statute reads without personal knowledge
 
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
can come and without doing a full
 
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
investigation without training detain
 
02:19:19.969 --> 02:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
someone and prevent them from doing
 
02:19:22.250 --> 02:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
anything so a police officer arrives at
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
which point the the police officer won't
 
02:19:26.089 --> 02:19:26.099 align:start position:0%
have statutory Authority and will need
 
02:19:28.009 --> 02:19:28.019 align:start position:0%
to release the person
 
02:19:32.089 --> 02:19:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:34.969 --> 02:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion if this were to pass
 
02:19:37.849 --> 02:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
is written would not the employees at
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
that point become agents of the state
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
I I do think that's what happens yes
 
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
and would then liability incur on behalf
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
of the state or how do you see that that
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
would play out
 
02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.590 align:start position:0%
would play out
um

02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:56.210 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:58.969 --> 02:19:58.979 align:start position:0%
I think that I'm way over my element to
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
talk about liability I have never bought
 
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit and I've never recovered a
 
02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
dollar in Damages from anyone so because
 
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
I'm I was a public defender for 14 years
 
02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
and and what I do now and I I about
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
liability principles I don't know I I do
 
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
think that let me let me interrupt you
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking more along the lines of
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
um liability in other words of a police
 
02:20:22.969 --> 02:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
officer injures somebody in the course
 
02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
of doing their Duty they're indemnified
 
02:20:27.170 --> 02:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
as long as it was in good faith for the
 
02:20:30.349 --> 02:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
most part whereas these folks injure
 
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
somebody are they are they criminally
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
liable I mean are they exempt from the
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
criminal laws at that point
 
02:20:39.889 --> 02:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
well um it's going to come down to as
 
02:20:41.450 --> 02:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
the language is put whether or not their
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
action was reasonable right
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
um so I certainly think you're going to
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
see litigation
 
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
um and my reasonable police officer or
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable hospital I mean what's the
 
02:20:52.849 --> 02:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
standard that that would be that raises
 
02:20:54.650 --> 02:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
a whole new area of law that's not it
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely because the statute doesn't
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
Define that at present I mean the
 
02:20:59.450 --> 02:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
proposed language doesn't Define that it
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
just uses the word reasonable and and
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
the reason I I
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's important I mean what you
 
02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is is key the
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
reasonablish language which I I presume
 
02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
was taken from the you know the store
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
owner holding someone for shoplifting
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
um but but that language is is I'm
 
02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
pretty sure drawn from a U.S Supreme
 
02:21:24.050 --> 02:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
Court case Terry versus Ohio about when
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
a police officer can have an interaction
 
02:21:28.730 --> 02:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
with someone that's short of a full
 
02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
arrest I think that's different from
 
02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
talking about reasonableness in the
 
02:21:34.610 --> 02:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
context of self-defense so even though
 
02:21:35.929 --> 02:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
it's the same word in the English
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
language it comes from different bodies
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you very much
 
02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
there's anyone else who has not
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
testified in this bill would like to
 
02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:52.490 align:start position:0%
testified in this bill would like to
testify

02:21:52.490 --> 02:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:21:54.290 --> 02:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none I hereby close to public
 
02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:55.550 align:start position:0%
seeing none I hereby close to public
hearing

02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
the committee will be in recess until 12
 
02:21:59.570 --> 02:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
o'clock when we will take up the
 
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
and you're welcome I didn't ask all the
 
02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:15.130 --> 02:22:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
listen my tongue is bleeding so bad I
 
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
need stitches
 
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
I hate to see people get hurt
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
and how are you struggling
 
02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:55.010 align:start position:0%
and how are you struggling
yeah

02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.020 --> 02:23:01.730 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:23:01.730 --> 02:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:04.210 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:23:04.210 --> 02:23:04.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.250 --> 02:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.260 --> 03:12:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
teaching you know and the emotional toll
 
03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
and now as I think about sending my
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
child off to to college the
 
03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:27.230 align:start position:0%
child off to to college the
um

03:12:27.230 --> 03:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
all the normal anxieties as a parent of
 
03:12:31.309 --> 03:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
sending your kid away to be with someone
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
else are so much more exacerbated by
 
03:12:35.809 --> 03:12:35.819 align:start position:0%
just the implications of all of this and
 
03:12:39.950 --> 03:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:42.110 --> 03:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
03:12:45.050 --> 03:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I too am in full
 
03:12:47.710 --> 03:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
support of a felony
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
as we know not only our Our First
 
03:12:54.530 --> 03:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
Responders put it at risk in situations
 
03:12:57.290 --> 03:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
like this but emergency calls that come
 
03:12:58.969 --> 03:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
in that those emergency responders
 
03:13:02.210 --> 03:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
cannot respond to that you know it
 
03:13:04.010 --> 03:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
really we're looking at so many lives
 
03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
that are impacted and and I think some
 
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the examples people gave here
 
03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
certainly speak to it so absolutely and
 
03:13:12.769 --> 03:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
in full support
 
03:13:14.510 --> 03:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative I'm sorry I don't see
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
your name tag but resin
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
relate a little story I worked in
 
03:13:23.389 --> 03:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
special education for 10 years in the
 
03:13:25.550 --> 03:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
Rochester school system and I worked
 
03:13:27.650 --> 03:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
with a number of autistic children and
 
03:13:30.050 --> 03:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
when I started their active shooter
 
03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
drills were not a regular thing
 
03:13:34.969 --> 03:13:34.979 align:start position:0%
but I'll tell you when I was in a room
 
03:13:38.150 --> 03:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
with a single child with a room that did
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
not have a door in it but we had a
 
03:13:41.389 --> 03:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
closet in the room and there was an
 
03:13:42.650 --> 03:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
active shooter drill gets called off
 
03:13:43.969 --> 03:13:43.979 align:start position:0%
it's much different than a fire alarm
 
03:13:45.830 --> 03:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know we were having our fire drills
 
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
or found me walk the children out very
 
03:13:50.210 --> 03:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
easily when I have to take that a child
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
who was severely autistic and put them
 
03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
into a a dark closet very confining
 
03:13:59.929 --> 03:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
closet and basically hold him in a bear
 
03:14:02.450 --> 03:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
hug so he doesn't so that his screams
 
03:14:04.849 --> 03:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
can't be heard
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
that is traumatic to that child this is
 
03:14:09.830 --> 03:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
not a victimless crime even the drills
 
03:14:11.929 --> 03:14:11.939 align:start position:0%
are criminal that what we do to these
 
03:14:11.939 --> 03:14:12.710 align:start position:0%
are criminal that what we do to these
children

03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:14:14.330 --> 03:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
when I got him out of that closet after
 
03:14:16.730 --> 03:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
just 15 minutes in there the rest of the
 
03:14:19.730 --> 03:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
day was impossible like his parents
 
03:14:21.290 --> 03:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
worked so we couldn't send him home but
 
03:14:22.969 --> 03:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
it was just nothing to do the kid was
 
03:14:24.889 --> 03:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
hysterical for the rest of the day and
 
03:14:27.050 --> 03:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
that was just one child I know a number
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
of other children in similar situations
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the state who go through the
 
03:14:32.210 --> 03:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
same thing every time we have active
 
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
shooter drills
 
03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:35.150 align:start position:0%
shooter drills
alone

03:14:35.150 --> 03:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
alone
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
and people have to understand this is a
 
03:14:39.650 --> 03:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
serious crime and I will be supporting
 
03:14:41.150 --> 03:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
03:14:44.570 --> 03:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Amanda Puti
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
um for me it's personal in terms of my
 
03:14:52.849 --> 03:14:52.859 align:start position:0%
husband is a public school teacher and
 
03:14:55.610 --> 03:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
this is his second career and every time
 
03:14:57.889 --> 03:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
I hear uh
 
03:15:00.889 --> 03:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
false alarm and you know my first
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
immediate response is to pray and I hope
 
03:15:06.889 --> 03:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
I see him alive coming back and for him
 
03:15:10.370 --> 03:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
it is more how do we save the students I
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to save my
 
03:15:16.730 --> 03:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
students and whenever it's a false or in
 
03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
the told the health toll it takes on the
 
03:15:23.570 --> 03:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
teachers and the students is immense and
 
03:15:25.510 --> 03:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's a long lasting
 
03:15:29.210 --> 03:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
changes so I would be 100 behind it
 
03:15:33.230 --> 03:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you any further representative pru
 
03:15:35.450 --> 03:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
I know from the first responder As A
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
Firefighter EMT uh
 
03:15:40.730 --> 03:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
when we're responding to these things
 
03:15:43.790 --> 03:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
we're already we jump it up to a higher
 
03:15:45.530 --> 03:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
level because children are obviously
 
03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
involved in maybe take chances that we
 
03:15:51.650 --> 03:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
probably normally went to get there and
 
03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
our job is now to go in with the police
 
03:15:55.790 --> 03:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
as well so it's a whole different level
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're in a whole different mindset and
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
and it's happening way too often and
 
03:16:04.070 --> 03:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
there needs to definitely be some kind
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
of deterrent to put an end to this
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wheeler thank
 
03:16:11.030 --> 03:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman it's personal for me as
 
03:16:13.370 --> 03:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
well I uh pretty sure I'm the only
 
03:16:14.990 --> 03:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
person on this committee who was just in
 
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
high school in these last five years and
 
03:16:18.110 --> 03:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
I remember
 
03:16:18.120 --> 03:16:20.349 align:start position:0%
I remember
um

03:16:20.349 --> 03:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
and I remember very clearly
 
03:16:25.070 --> 03:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know being in middle school and
 
03:16:26.809 --> 03:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
the these drills are getting
 
03:16:30.769 --> 03:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
exponentially more uh common as I was in
 
03:16:34.250 --> 03:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
school and we had many false reports in
 
03:16:36.889 --> 03:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
conval when I was in school it happens a
 
03:16:38.990 --> 03:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
decent amount not to this level all the
 
03:16:40.849 --> 03:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
time but this level does happen we just
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
saw it in Portsmouth we just saw it in
 
03:16:46.570 --> 03:16:46.580 align:start position:0%
our in our state and I I just remember
 
03:16:49.610 --> 03:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
as representative grassy said how scary
 
03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
the drills themselves were
 
03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
um some of my friends worrying about
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not they get stuck in the
 
03:16:59.650 --> 03:16:59.660 align:start position:0%
bathroom or get stuck in the hallway and
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's a reality that kids who are
 
03:17:04.190 --> 03:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
educating should not have to face and
 
03:17:06.650 --> 03:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
03:17:09.610 --> 03:17:09.620 align:start position:0%
a supporter of felonies or increasing
 
03:17:13.490 --> 03:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
charges too often but this is a case in
 
03:17:14.929 --> 03:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
which I really do feel that we need to
 
03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
I've gone through it far too much and I
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
think that making a statement that this
 
03:17:22.610 --> 03:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
is a felonious crime is uh the right
 
03:17:24.349 --> 03:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
thing that the state should be doing and
 
03:17:28.490 --> 03:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:33.050 --> 03:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:34.730 --> 03:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to support the motion
 
03:17:40.969 --> 03:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
because this is not a victimless crime
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is an act of terrorism uh and it's
 
03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct I think from a
 
03:17:49.190 --> 03:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
genuine threat what we had in Portsmouth
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
last week uh was a young man who made
 
03:17:55.969 --> 03:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
threats on social media
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
um police investigated and found that
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
those threats were borne out he had the
 
03:18:03.710 --> 03:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
the weaponry and the ammunition in hand
 
03:18:05.750 --> 03:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
to carry them out we're not talking
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
about that here what we're talking about
 
03:18:12.429 --> 03:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
here is the worst kind of swatting
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
these are people who for one reason or
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
another decide that it's fun uh or uh it
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's some kind of a game to call police
 
03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
departments and report an active shooter
 
03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I just think we've
 
03:18:34.130 --> 03:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
all seen from all of the news reports
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
from all of the recent incidents both
 
03:18:40.090 --> 03:18:40.100 align:start position:0%
real and false is
 
03:18:43.870 --> 03:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
how this entire situation
 
03:18:47.389 --> 03:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
not only wears on teachers and students
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
and parents but also how it wears on
 
03:18:52.870 --> 03:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
police officers who have to respond
 
03:18:55.429 --> 03:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the things where
 
03:18:57.530 --> 03:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
we're basically kind of coming to is
 
03:19:01.490 --> 03:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
almost like a societal PTSD around
 
03:19:04.370 --> 03:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
incidents like this so I think passing a
 
03:19:07.730 --> 03:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
bill like this sends a message to people
 
03:19:10.610 --> 03:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
who would try this or attempt it that
 
03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
this is something we're going to take
 
03:19:15.050 --> 03:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
seriously this isn't just a 17 year old
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
pulling a false fire alarm outside the
 
03:19:21.170 --> 03:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
boys room in high school this is a crime
 
03:19:23.570 --> 03:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
this is an act of terrorism and we're
 
03:19:25.610 --> 03:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
going to treat it like one
 
03:19:30.110 --> 03:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and I'm heartened to
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
hear the um the bipartisan testimony
 
03:19:34.790 --> 03:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I am hoping that
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
this committee will speak with one voice
 
03:19:38.690 --> 03:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
and we will unanimously send this to the
 
03:19:40.550 --> 03:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
floor and
 
03:19:42.349 --> 03:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
um this committee and therefore this
 
03:19:44.330 --> 03:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
state will be indicating that we will
 
03:19:46.610 --> 03:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
not tolerate this kind of behavior with
 
03:19:49.070 --> 03:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
that I would ask the temporary Clerk and
 
03:19:52.490 --> 03:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:52.500 --> 03:19:56.330 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:19:56.330 --> 03:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:56.340 --> 03:19:58.250 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:19:58.250 --> 03:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:19:58.260 --> 03:19:59.809 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

03:19:59.809 --> 03:19:59.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:19:59.819 --> 03:20:02.990 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:12.769 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:20:12.769 --> 03:20:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:12.779 --> 03:20:30.170 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:20:30.170 --> 03:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:30.180 --> 03:20:32.929 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:20:32.929 --> 03:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:32.939 --> 03:20:44.929 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:20:44.929 --> 03:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:44.939 --> 03:20:47.570 align:start position:0%
 
yay

03:20:47.570 --> 03:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
yay
 
03:20:50.990 --> 03:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:53.450 --> 03:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
the motion about to pass passes
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
unanimously 20-0 any objection to
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
consent see none the bill will go on
 
03:21:00.590 --> 03:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
consent and with that I close the
 
03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
executive session on SB 244.
 
03:21:07.389 --> 03:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
I opened the executive session on
 
03:21:10.969 --> 03:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
sb252 relative to defendant's pending
 
03:21:13.130 --> 03:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
trial release this is um the bail Bill
 
03:21:15.650 --> 03:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um I'm going to start by
 
03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
saying at the beginning of this session
 
03:21:19.490 --> 03:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
when I saw that we had a lot of these
 
03:21:21.050 --> 03:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
bail bills coming in from different
 
03:21:22.969 --> 03:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle a lot of different
 
03:21:22.979 --> 03:21:24.830 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle a lot of different
suggestions

03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
03:21:26.450 --> 03:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
um I realized that it was going to take
 
03:21:28.010 --> 03:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
a little bit more work than just
 
03:21:30.950 --> 03:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
Patchwork bills so I made a commitment
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
to this committee and to the public at
 
03:21:34.130 --> 03:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
large that I would retain all those
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
bills and we would work on them over the
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
summer in a bipartisan fashion to come
 
03:21:39.290 --> 03:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
up with something that we all could
 
03:21:43.130 --> 03:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
agree on and I intend to
 
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
maintain that commitment so therefore on
 
03:21:49.190 --> 03:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 252 I make a motion to retain
 
03:21:51.650 --> 03:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's why you're a second second
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:55.800 --> 03:22:00.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just quickly add on to what I just
 
03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
said when I speak to speak to the motion
 
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
um we have I believe four or five
 
03:22:09.290 --> 03:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
different bail bills dealing with
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
different parts of the law dealing with
 
03:22:14.330 --> 03:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
different issues in the law and we need
 
03:22:16.670 --> 03:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
to look at those and look what's really
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
going on not take anecdotes not take
 
03:22:20.880 --> 03:22:21.769 align:start position:0%
going on not take anecdotes not take
um

03:22:21.769 --> 03:22:21.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
Panic measures on it we need to we have
 
03:22:26.090 --> 03:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
level and cool heads when we look at it
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
as start of the process of looking into
 
03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
it the first thing I discovered that is
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
causing some of the problem is that
 
03:22:35.690 --> 03:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
police departments in different parts of
 
03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
the states have no way of knowing
 
03:22:39.769 --> 03:22:39.779 align:start position:0%
whether somebody's already on bail so a
 
03:22:41.090 --> 03:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
lot of times the bail Commissioners are
 
03:22:42.410 --> 03:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
getting a bad rap saying why are you
 
03:22:43.730 --> 03:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
letting people out who are already on
 
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
bail well frankly we discovered there's
 
03:22:47.150 --> 03:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
no way for them to know they were
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
already on bail that there's no
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
interconnection between them it's a
 
03:22:53.750 --> 03:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
paper system so I was able to just under
 
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
the wire get the state police to get me
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
an estimate from their vendors and I was
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
able to get a million dollars into the
 
03:23:04.130 --> 03:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
budget to fix that problem this year so
 
03:23:05.570 --> 03:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's the first step that we're taking
 
03:23:05.580 --> 03:23:07.490 align:start position:0%
that's the first step that we're taking
and

03:23:07.490 --> 03:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:10.130 --> 03:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful this summer The subcommittee
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
will come together and we will come up
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
with a good piece of legislation to to
 
03:23:17.030 --> 03:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
fix anything else that we deem needs for
 
03:23:19.729 --> 03:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
repairing representative gathright would
 
03:23:23.090 --> 03:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.229 --> 03:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the retention
 
03:23:29.389 --> 03:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the oh I'm sorry
 
03:23:32.510 --> 03:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that I uh
 
03:23:37.250 --> 03:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate the chair's efforts adding
 
03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
the money to the budget to actually
 
03:23:41.870 --> 03:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
address a systemic communication problem
 
03:23:44.170 --> 03:23:44.180 align:start position:0%
between our court system and our police
 
03:23:46.550 --> 03:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
is actually
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
a great example of the kind of things
 
03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to be doing we have uh we
 
03:23:54.110 --> 03:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
have systemic issues with the judicial
 
03:23:56.269 --> 03:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
system that are manifesting them
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
themselves as uh a lot of the cases that
 
03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
are coming up in anecdotes
 
03:24:03.650 --> 03:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
um and I think as we hear testimony
 
03:24:06.530 --> 03:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
we've heard that we don't have enough
 
03:24:09.050 --> 03:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
prosecutors the prosecutors we do have
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
often don't have enough time to track
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
these cases in court we hear there are
 
03:24:17.450 --> 03:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
issues with bail Commissioners not being
 
03:24:19.309 --> 03:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
properly trained we hear that
 
03:24:21.650 --> 03:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
magistrates might be a solution that
 
03:24:24.229 --> 03:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
more judges may be be a solution I think
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
the one thing that's become really
 
03:24:28.330 --> 03:24:28.340 align:start position:0%
apparent to us is that making
 
03:24:31.070 --> 03:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
reflexive decisions on bills that are
 
03:24:33.469 --> 03:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
that are very narrowly focused in this
 
03:24:36.290 --> 03:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
area especially right now isn't going to
 
03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
serve us particularly well so I I know I
 
03:24:42.650 --> 03:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to to really
 
03:24:45.530 --> 03:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
take a look at this from a broader more
 
03:24:48.290 --> 03:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
systemic perspective effective and and
 
03:24:50.269 --> 03:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
to do it over the summer knowing that we
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually have a deadline to get
 
03:24:53.929 --> 03:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
something done and that we need to act
 
03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
on these bills
 
03:24:58.550 --> 03:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
um but I I appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:24:59.990 --> 03:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
do it in a
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
in a considered way where we're going to
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
be able to have the ongoing opportunity
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
to get additional input from
 
03:25:09.170 --> 03:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
stakeholders throughout the process to
 
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
be able to test ideas with each other
 
03:25:12.889 --> 03:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
and with different people I just think
 
03:25:14.929 --> 03:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
that way we wind up with with better
 
03:25:17.450 --> 03:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
laws and and it puts us in a better
 
03:25:20.510 --> 03:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
position to fulfill our responsibilities
 
03:25:23.570 --> 03:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire to to not
 
03:25:26.030 --> 03:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
only to keep everybody safe but to make
 
03:25:27.710 --> 03:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody's constitutional
 
03:25:31.190 --> 03:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
rights are respected so again I I
 
03:25:34.429 --> 03:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh the retained motion
 
03:25:36.349 --> 03:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
and I intend to vote for it thank you
 
03:25:38.809 --> 03:25:38.819 align:start position:0%

03:25:38.819 --> 03:25:39.769 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

representative Newman
 
03:25:43.610 --> 03:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I also want to
 
03:25:45.710 --> 03:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank the chair for
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
appropriating money for a data system
 
03:25:50.929 --> 03:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
because I think it's very important that
 
03:25:52.849 --> 03:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
whoever it is that makes the decision on
 
03:25:55.490 --> 03:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
whether to Grant bail or not whether
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's a judge or a uh the mail
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner or a magistrate or whoever
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
it is it is has the appropriate
 
03:26:05.450 --> 03:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
information in front of them so that
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
they can make an appropriate decision
 
03:26:09.170 --> 03:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
based upon what the true facts are thank
 
03:26:09.180 --> 03:26:12.229 align:start position:0%

03:27:11.269 --> 03:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:27:16.010 --> 03:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I forgot what number this is SB 252
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
um so for the committee at a
 
03:27:21.290 --> 03:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
um SP 58 the subcommittee is the last
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
bill we have to act on except for oh
 
03:27:26.750 --> 03:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
what's that oh I do have one more we
 
03:27:28.729 --> 03:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
have to tell me to go anywhere
 
03:27:30.349 --> 03:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
um the last bill we have to act on
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's still in play after today I'm
 
03:27:35.889 --> 03:27:35.899 align:start position:0%
about to open executive session on SB 76
 
03:27:39.050 --> 03:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
for like the fifth time I think
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to reopen it because it's
 
03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
it was in recessed
 
03:27:45.530 --> 03:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
um so as I said 58 will be the last one
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
until that'll be it for our work for the
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
summer except for subcommittee work so
 
03:27:51.290 --> 03:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
the sooner we get 58 done the sooner
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
we're out of here for the the break so
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
at this point I'll open the executive
 
03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
session on SB 76 and rep recognize

thank you would like to speak to your
 
03:28:25.070 --> 03:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
motion representative
 
03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
freshman of the high school right as
 
03:28:28.610 --> 03:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
like like man you had said actually I am
 
03:28:30.710 --> 03:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
a freshman at a high school that's right
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
um uh yes Mr chairman so SB 76 we've
 
03:28:36.650 --> 03:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
done this five times because there was a
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion from the public
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given uh people were
 
03:28:43.250 --> 03:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
talking about two different statutes uh
 
03:28:45.710 --> 03:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
the statute in here right as it stands
 
03:28:49.490 --> 03:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
is an amendment to six RSA 644 colon
 
03:28:51.410 --> 03:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
seven which amends the abuse of the
 
03:28:54.769 --> 03:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
corpse statute and includes uh uh
 
03:28:56.450 --> 03:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
failure to report the death of an
 
03:28:58.610 --> 03:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
individual or finding a corpse to law
 
03:29:01.070 --> 03:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh or unlawfully removing
 
03:29:02.690 --> 03:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
concealing or destroying the corpse so
 
03:29:05.269 --> 03:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
this is the bill as it should have been
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh and includes Maryland's law which is
 
03:29:10.969 --> 03:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
uh the the name request that was given
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
to us
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
um by the woman who was testifying for
 
03:29:15.950 --> 03:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
her grandmother who uh whose death
 
03:29:19.849 --> 03:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
wasn't reported by the Sun so I no
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
further comment other than that thank
 
03:29:23.450 --> 03:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
you representative Rhodes would you like
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
to speak to you second
 
03:29:26.330 --> 03:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative
 
03:29:29.090 --> 03:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
wheeler did a fantastic job and just to
 
03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
clarify any confusion that may exist
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
we had to recess the last bill
 
03:29:37.250 --> 03:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
um because we we actually had two
 
03:29:38.210 --> 03:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
different amendments which we weren't
 
03:29:40.610 --> 03:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
able to do and then we also discovered
 
03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
that it was unfortunate the wording that
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
we had
 
03:29:47.150 --> 03:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
was actually making it where if a if a
 
03:29:49.010 --> 03:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
loved one witnessed a family member say
 
03:29:50.889 --> 03:29:50.899 align:start position:0%
die in a hospital
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
they actually would have been guilty of
 
03:29:55.910 --> 03:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
a crime had they chosen to call a family
 
03:29:58.849 --> 03:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
member before reporting it either to you
 
03:30:00.170 --> 03:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
know some in the hospital or to a police
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
officer so we we fixed all that and um
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
we kept it simple and I believe that
 
03:30:09.170 --> 03:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
this is great the way that it is so I
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
would ask everybody to please support it
 
03:30:14.030 --> 03:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I would ask everyone to support it
 
03:30:16.010 --> 03:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
too because if I never see this bill
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:25.250 --> 03:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
did they come around it went around
 
03:30:29.090 --> 03:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
somewhere I didn't get it oh
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:33.889 --> 03:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
03:30:36.290 --> 03:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion on the bill
 
03:30:36.300 --> 03:30:38.330 align:start position:0%

03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
from August to end of September but I
 
03:34:22.510 --> 03:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:24.610 --> 03:34:24.620 align:start position:0%
yeah he does yeah thank God
 
03:34:26.450 --> 03:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes wanted to address
 
03:34:28.490 --> 03:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
something yes thank you Mr chairman I
 
03:34:30.349 --> 03:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
would just like to take a few moments to
 
03:34:30.359 --> 03:34:31.550 align:start position:0%
would just like to take a few moments to
address

03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
our uh bill that we have the
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
menstruation bill that that we that we
 
03:34:39.120 --> 03:34:40.070 align:start position:0%
menstruation bill that that we that we
um

03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
testified in front of the Senate
 
03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
so during that testimony representative
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
Reed and I um had the opportunity to
 
03:34:50.330 --> 03:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
testify together as a team
 
03:34:53.690 --> 03:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
and the the version that we have
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately came out of here
 
03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
without a recommendation I would like
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
for everybody to take a look at that and
 
03:35:02.690 --> 03:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
there's actually a a couple of flaws
 
03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
that are in there that weren't that
 
03:35:06.050 --> 03:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
weren't even discovered when we were
 
03:35:08.330 --> 03:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
here it was after the fact that is
 
03:35:11.389 --> 03:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
actually making it where we really can't
 
03:35:14.030 --> 03:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
actually pass it even on the floor is
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
there some grammical errors in in one of
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
them is it references the superintendent
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
as being in charge of the county the
 
03:35:25.969 --> 03:35:25.979 align:start position:0%
state and of the the juvenile detention
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
center so that that is something and
 
03:35:30.650 --> 03:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
another thing that has come up that is
 
03:35:32.570 --> 03:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
not any of our faults but you know we
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
did not specifically put a number and we
 
03:35:37.969 --> 03:35:37.979 align:start position:0%
were asked to do that for our version
 
03:35:40.370 --> 03:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
which we did and now apparently the
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
other body doesn't seem to think that
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
they want the number in there so
 
03:35:46.849 --> 03:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
good luck to us on the floor okay so the
 
03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
version we passed out of here without
 
03:35:51.889 --> 03:35:51.899 align:start position:0%
recommendation is still in play if I'm
 
03:35:54.290 --> 03:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
not mistaken and we may need to do a
 
03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment and see if we can come
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
together on it because the Senate
 
03:35:58.370 --> 03:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
version looks like it might go down in
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
flames I think they're going to amend it
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
again I don't know just at the end of
 
03:36:05.210 --> 03:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
the day I want to make sure we get a we
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
get a piece of legislation out to help
 
03:36:08.809 --> 03:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
those people because that's what was
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:13.560 --> 03:36:14.690 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:36:14.690 --> 03:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative Jennifer and there had
 
03:36:17.870 --> 03:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
better not be a better conference on
 
03:36:19.490 --> 03:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
this go it's not necessary it's really
 
03:36:20.929 --> 03:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
they're making the whole thing is just
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
far more complicated than it needs to be
 
03:36:24.650 --> 03:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
we address the issues the bill we have
