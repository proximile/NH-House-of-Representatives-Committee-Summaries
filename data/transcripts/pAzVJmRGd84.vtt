00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:28.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
then we can create the
 
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
then we can create the
conversation

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
so and really Jane saying to me all
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
through this like we have been dealing
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
issue for so many
 
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
years but the issue that we always were
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
focused on on was the balance billing
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
issue y that was that was the primary
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
issue is that we wanted to get rid of
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
balance billing
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
and we were certainly acutely
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
aware that uh the reason why balance
 
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.949 align:start position:0%
aware that uh the reason why balance
billing

00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
billing
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
exists is that the ambulance companies
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
are not getting enough
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement okay so what's happened in
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
my mind in terms of what sen Bill 407 is
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
it comes in and say no we're we don't
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
care about the balance issue all we care
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
about is how do we get more money for
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
the ambulance
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
companies and so I'm a
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
little I'm a little put off because we
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
we the insurance department had the
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
study committee we talked about even we
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
talked about legislation and how
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
important that that study committee was
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
going to try to get to a resolution and
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
work on some resolution and and then we
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
were told there was a Senate bill and
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
and um evidently the the Senate bill was
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
hijacked and turned into something much
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
different when it came to uh this rate
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
setting thing and the idea that we're
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
going to rate set is just an anathema to
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
me I just the idea that we the
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
legislature are going to start um you
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
know doing the 320 whatever you know
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
just just that whole idea is we've never
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
done that before all I can imagine is
 
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
the precent by setting that then
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
everyone who feels like they're not
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
getting enough will come running in and
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
saying you know we want you to rate set
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
for us so when I I'm going through my
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
head in terms of where how we get to
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
where we were and what what was what do
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
we really want to be doing here okay so
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
given that the ultimate goal that we
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
were hoping that that we expected the
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
legislation to do balance billing is is
 
00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:27.910 align:start position:0%
legislation to do balance billing is is
still

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
in cville 407 that to me right out of
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
the block gives and then and then have
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
the race setting I I'm I'm really having
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
a little trouble trying to make that
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
bill as amended work at all okay um so
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
my inclination would be to interim study
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
it okay however let me finish my War
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
more thought and then I'll take but
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
however when I was discussing calling
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
you I talked to you last night and I
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
guess I'm allowed to say that that it's
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
not illegally because it just oneon-one
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and I taped it okay right well then
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
you broke the law you broke the law so
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
that the issue was that you know that
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's if we were to stay the course
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
that we thought we were on and which was
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
that you know how are we G how are we
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
going to get to that how do we get rid
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the balance bilding how what are
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
where is that balance billing and
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
um I it it struck me
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
that in through the hearing that
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
ambulance services is is as important
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
every cities in town as all their other
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
Municipal Services Fire Department
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
police what it's just another Municipal
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
service and that um and theoretically
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
everybody and I know my town does it you
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
know every town has money in their
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
budget for the ambulance service and yes
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
it is a private you know in in our case
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's a nonprofit but in other cases it's
 
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
a private and some cases it's actually
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
part of the fire department so every
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
town theoretically could would have
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
solved the balance billing problem if
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
they just paid for it yeah raise taxes
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
no well they would be pay through taxes
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
but they could pay the balance billing
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
and that and then and we did hear that
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
there was a certain town that actually
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
did that that they don't balance Bill
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
their residents they just absorb they
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
just pay for what about the teeny tiny
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
towns that don't have the population
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
well they say the teeny tiny town which
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
I would call My Town you know maybe not
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
teeny tiny but big we 6,000 people that
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
we actually our town in in
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey has a nonprofit ambulance
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
service between the two towns and we
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
basically funded we have set us about
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
800 right so and your and how how does
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
your Ambulance Service stay flow I
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
volunteers and it's paid through the
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
town if you there's a line item in your
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
town budget for them okay so the issue
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
came in my mind is so town could solve
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
this problem by just you know hitting
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers but the taxpayers probably
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
don't really want to pay for it and they
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
probably want that skin in the game they
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
want the person who called the ambulance
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
to have some skin in the game to have to
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
have that co-pay they want that balance
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
building they want they don't say we
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay it for all we want
 
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
that person to be you know you you call
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
it because you really need it you
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
understand the consequence that that
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's got to have to be paid for but some
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
heart attack you should and you don't
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
have money you shouldn't call the
 
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
ambulance no and I'm saying that that
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
obviously some towns do pay for it yeah
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
okay and my understanding is if you had
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
a heart attack and you know and you're
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
an inent that yeah they they they'll
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
write it off they most counts right at
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
off okay so again now so now I'm off on
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
this other tangent I'm still dealing the
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
balance building
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
issue I'm not even talking about how we
 
00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:56.789 align:start position:0%
issue I'm not even talking about how we
fully

00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
fully
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
reimburse you know the this you know the
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
the ambulances to get what they really
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
need and and and you said to me well the
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
one thing that that we're intrigued
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
about with the uh insurance department
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
amendment was that it had in that
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment had this collection system so
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
we can really find out what is going on
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
out there so it does seem to me
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate that before we Implement a
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
system where a fee system and before we
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
do the mon we should actually have real
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
data on exactly what is the financial
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
Str of all these different entities what
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
is going on with the small towns versus
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
the Big Towns what is really going how
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
long is that going to take I well so how
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
what was the time frame in your
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment well but but this has gone on
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
and on and on for years and now we're
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
saying we need two more years to
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
evaluate it and that doesn't seem
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
to work well the only com comment I
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
would have with that is when you say
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
gone on and on theoretically they've
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
been underfunded since I've ever served
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
on this committee so 30 years so we're
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
say okay we're going to make it two more
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
well we're making it two more with the
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
showing that we're good faith interest
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
that if we can intervene and do
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
something about it that we're willing to
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
try and look at it but at the end of the
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
day the question is is how many
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies have gone out of
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
business because they keep threatening
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
this guy falling have gone out of
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
business in my 30 years well I know of
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
one and Kean and if anybody really wants
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
to know the true story I happen to have
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit of insight on it since uh I
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
live in jesha county and uh and we we
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
ended up creating the replacement so we
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
can talk about that but I at the end of
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
the day the the struggles that they're
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
having whatever they're having I think
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
before we go into the rat setting
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
business we really need to know exactly
 
00:21:57.789 --> 00:21:57.799 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with so are and I
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
don't mean this in tanistic way are you
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
proposing that we wait the two years and
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
not do anything right now so in terms
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
of in terms of you know that the issue
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
of balance billing I mean I would like
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
to say you know let's just ban balance
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
billing okay um but I
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
there you really want to have have you I
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
mean so you're
 
00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:25.950 align:start position:0%
mean so you're
saying

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh you just want to have a bill that
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
says Bal we ban I didn't say that I'm
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
just saying I I'm uncomfortable I don't
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
know what I mean I'm not gonna I I don't
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
know what the solution is I'm
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable saying we're not going to
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
do anything for two years that's all I'm
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
saying okay you're you're not too
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
excited about putting this off you feel
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
like today's the crisis I think the
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
where was the crisis you know last two
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
years ago last year we had the same
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
crisis hear from represent spear
 
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.110 align:start position:0%
crisis hear from represent spear
represent

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
spear okay putting my engineering hat on
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm working with the
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
numbers what this bill does and as you
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
pointed out and as I incorrectly asked
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
the question yesterday I asked a couple
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the folks would the
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
325 fix your problem and they said Yes
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
except that I did not ask the right
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
question the question really
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
is the only people that would be paying
 
00:23:19.159 --> 00:23:20.070 align:start position:0%
is the only people that would be paying
the

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
325 are the
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
8.6% of the insured
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
population that is under fully insured
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
that is fully
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
insured they are the only ones that
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
would be paying the 325 per. correct all
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
of the others the over 90% of people
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
just go on and do whatever they're doing
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
right now so whatever money losses the
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
ambulances are facing and I I absolutely
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
believe that they are facing some big
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
losses we're we're trying to carve out a
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
tiny group of people to fix the problem
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that's just doesn't even make
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
mathematical sense and the other part of
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
that is other under the fully insured we
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
have the small group Market which could
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
not possibly afford taking on that kind
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
of money that kind of uh a four a $4
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
pmpm is staggering to that group and
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
they're the only ones that it would that
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
would be hit with that we have finally
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
gotten to the point where we are under
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
6% un insured and let's face it healthc
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
care is absolutely dependent on being
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
4.9% we are putting that whole effort at
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
risk by forcing people to pay more money
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
just in a small group just in a small
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
group to try and fix a problem that is
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
so much bigger than what they handle I
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
really need we need the information we
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely need the information and and
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
that Summit didn't come out with what we
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
were hoping it would come out with and
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
somehow maybe what we need need is a
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill that forces everybody to sit at the
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
table give us the numbers and let us
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
work it out that we we absolutely have
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
to work it out but not the way we're
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
doing it not not this just shoot in the
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
dark and and hit a certain small segment
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
of people and everybody else just gets
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
to do what they want and let's face it
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
the biggest chunk of people that are
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
going to need this bit need ambulance
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
me and I'm on Medicare so I don't care
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
that's not gonna help them R
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
supp yeah so Carrie put on her
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
engineering hat I put on my Economist
 
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
hat last night and I actually gave the
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
the lead sponsor a call to kind of talk
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
because I I missed I had to leave early
 
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um one of the thing
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
everything she said I agree with it's
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that it falls to a tiny
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
little piece um when I spoke with the
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
lead sponsor she said you know other
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
groups have already come up like the
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid come up a little bit but you
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
know one of the things that really
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
concerns me on it
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
is we're sort of putting this on
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
autopilot with this law so if we say you
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
get 325 per of Medicare and then next
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
year Medicare increases to the point
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
where they're actually funding it
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately it sounds like they're
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
very much underfunding right now
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
underpaying does that still go up by
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
that Delta of 325 per it sounds to me as
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
I understand the bill that it would and
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
that should concern all of us because if
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
we have an that on autopilot and
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
then Washington does what they should do
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
which is put more money into Medicare
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
funding that $4 is going to go up by how
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
much because now it's going to be 325
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
per of the much bigger Medicare number
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
which I don't know maybe Medicare will
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
go down and the opposite could happen
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
but but um but the reality of it is is
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
we need more money coming from the feds
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
which is primarily what is paying for
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid and to have some
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
sort of autopilot fixed Delta between
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
what we're paying is is I don't know if
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with that now if there
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
was some sort of sunset clause which I
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
know was discussed I don't know what
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
people's thinking on that if there was a
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
sunset Clause because we probably would
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
be okay for a short period of time to
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
sort of evaluate it if we want to do
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
something today I could probably get
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
behind that but the idea that there's a
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
fixed 325 of Medicare regardless of
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
whether Medicare is fully funding as
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
they should or whether or not they're
 
00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:28.750 align:start position:0%
they should or whether or not they're
underfunding

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
underfunding
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
concerns me and concern all of us
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
because that would really fleece the
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
people in this fully insured group so
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's the part that I'm most
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with and I don't know if
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
anybody thought about it ever was talked
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
about before I left but or after I left
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
but that's that was what really stuck in
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
my brain as I was leaving and thinking
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
about this last night I agree with you
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
100% I mean that's what I'm saying about
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
it's an unfortunate precedent because to
 
00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
put that number in there in statute you
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
know you have to takes a year to get it
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
out or year to change it
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Peli thank you
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you I uh Echo the comments that
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
are have been currently made I am
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the 325 per I'm not
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
exactly sure how that was derived there
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
was a much different number from our um
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
Insurance um Department spokesperson and
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
I go back to the I mean it really is
 
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
black and I go back to the pie chart I
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
mean the problem is Medicare and
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and we can you know as Carrie
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
said you look at the pie chart you
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
cannot ask this little sliver to try to
 
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
make up for the rest of it and my big
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
concern is that we're putting so much
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
pressure on small businesses that they
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
may decide in the future they're not
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
going to offer health insurance as a
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
benefit they'll give a a stipend or a
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
dollar figure to their employees and say
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
go out on the private market and good
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
luck so I don't think that we're going
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
to solve the problem I do want to see
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
the data because then they you know that
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
will be able to help us make the best
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
decisions and I definitely want to see
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
the the parties come back together and
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
to try to mandate that they come come
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
out with a solution or if they don't
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
then we could maybe put some parameters
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
in there if they don't this is what the
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
ramifications or the consequences could
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
potentially be and maybe we'll start to
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
get a little bit more movement if we if
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
they know that there's a Time dat
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
and uh requirements for coming up with
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
some answers so thank you thank you for
 
00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
microphone so everybody at home can hear
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
you good
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
morning okay so obviously the concern we
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
have is how long this is going to take
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
and you said two years is there any way
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
we can do it in a shorter period of time
 
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
well that's what I was um thinking about
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
as you were discussing it um it in some
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
senses um it might um reduce the task we
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
would still need an outside Actuarial
 
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:12.519 align:start position:0%
and accounting firm to be defining the
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
information that should be collected in
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
a uniform way collecting that
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
information and U making sense of it um
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh in a way that will inform the
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
legislature um and it's possible
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
um if we actually put in the legislation
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
um a a timeline deadline for submitting
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
the financial data for all the ambulance
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
providers in the state that uh we could
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
set at less than two years um I in my
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
mind I I don't know whether it would be
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
12 months or my mind in terms of you
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
know that um we need we would need you
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
know say when we in terms of the
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
legislative cycle
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay so uh that that if we did it
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
try to get it done for by January of
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
next year the next legislative cycle
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get a full Year's
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
worth of data right I mean let's assume
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
assume it takes them assume it takes
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
them uh always looking at data let me
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
interrupt um just for a second um you're
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
always looking at
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
data retrospectively so
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
past data yeah okay yeah so so is it
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
possible that that the this accounting
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
firm get it done in a couple of months
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
and then we would then be able to uh you
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
know have ask all the these financial
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
reporting numbers to be uh turned in by
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
by uh December 1st so that we could be
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
ready for the legislative
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's theoretically
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
possible um we also you know there's the
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
issue of of paying for it and uh the
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that we have um
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
creates a one-time special assessment on
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
the health carriers to pay for the cost
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
that I think it would be about a half a
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
million million we'd have to admit half
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
a million what half a million did you
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
much yeah humorize how where does that
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
how does that how does that work why
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
would you need so much money just for
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
the this that's my guess based on on my
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
own experience Contracting with outside
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
vendors that are uh have Actuarial
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
expertise actuaries are are not um sheap
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
um of course we would use like an RFI
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
process to get some idea of what um more
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
accurate price would be this is just you
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
know my guess so that that's twofold
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
none of you're getting the information
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
and then you're getting a a proposal out
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
of it to tell you what you're going to
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
recommend yeah because usually when we
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
do our studies or our mandate studies it
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
only costs like 20,000 or 40,000 I yeah
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
but that's because they're using
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
existing claims data that okay and the
 
00:33:33.159 --> 00:33:34.269 align:start position:0%
existing claims data that okay and the
process

00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
here yeah I thought that the that
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
Medicare was collecting this this data
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
Would we not would you as an official
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
Department have access to that data
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
already no uh but we do have access to
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
the uh data reporting template uh that
 
00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.870 align:start position:0%
the uh data reporting template uh that
they

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.470 align:start position:0%
they
use

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
no right to know um but it might not
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
help that much because they're not
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
surveying every single ambulance
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
provider in New Hampshire they they're
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
doing selected providers nationally so
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
my thought was that the vendor would
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
probably use their template but then
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
send it out to every ambulance provider
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
in the state um yeah and that's the you
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
know difficult process but I'm sorry
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
isn't that data already in our database
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
that we had a presentation on a while
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
ago it's not part of the claims data the
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
cost information yeah is not part of the
 
00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:32.990 align:start position:0%
cost information yeah is not part of the
claims

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
you yeah so the more I think about it I
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
do I do think we could operate on if if
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's a more limited task and we could
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
operate on um a tighter time frame it
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
probably would cost less than the dollar
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
well have to go to
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
finance and I assume that will be the
 
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
question that Finance is gonna want to
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
ask is what is it going to cost
 
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.950 align:start position:0%
ask is what is it going to cost
yeah

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.870 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
right okay that if we if if the goal is
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
to collect that data if we turn this
 
00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:26.839 align:start position:0%
bill into amend the bill to collecting
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
this data
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and having the department U have uh a
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
proposal ready for us for next
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
January the inter
 
00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:40.839 align:start position:0%
understood um I don't think it's interim
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
study because the the whole if I
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
understand we need legislative Authority
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
you need legislative authority to do
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
this so we would need to amend this Bill
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
Amend the Bill Amend the bill to put in
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
this study I could do it today if that's
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
what you have to uh you do it
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
that so the bill would be turned into
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
just a you know collect the data collect
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
the data with the intent of having
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislation for for January is it
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
possible that we get the parties back
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
together and mandate that they we can't
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
mandate the parties to talk to each
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
other no come up with something we're
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
kind of starting to like each other
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
anyway so I don't think it'll be that
 
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
hard I know they still sitting in the
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
separate sides of the
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
room gu well right Mr
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
chair Mr chairman yes yeah I know
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative M Miku was here this
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
morning and he was talking about as well
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
that first of all he said that the data
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the 350 came from other states that
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
they've done used in other states was
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
not a number that's been picked out of a
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
hat but he also one of his
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations as well was that maybe
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
what we should do to to work on this
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
problem now is to pass the bill that's
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
here with a sunset provision to it and
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
we could also um put not only a sunset
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
provision but also put a requirement
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
that this study take place as well so
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
that way there we the twoyear period
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
that could allow them to get more time I
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
he but I'm I'm reluctant to do give and
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
then take it then might and and and take
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
it away so that's why that's not a good
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
that I know I'm the one who offered it
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
up I said but maybe we should Sunset it
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
I mean I know I offered it up but I I I
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
i' I've had plenty of Sleepless hours
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
tonight to decide last night to say
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
realize that that's that's not a good I
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
think the other part of that was that
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
you quoted a number of four pm PM yeah
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
$447 that's a lot of money to put on
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
this tiny little group while we're
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
waiting for the twoe two uh years to
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
Sunset and I'm not prepared to risk our
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh uninsured rate for that money you
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
you've hit the nail
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
on on the nail on the head I agree with
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
you absolutely that that is a I mean I
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
if I were even R to do it I would not
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
certainly do it the 325 number I mean
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
that just I mean I I would take I would
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
take the the Department's numbers at
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
least which was scaled based upon the
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
two different the three different areas
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
and I i' take that um and but again that
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
would be it's incremental but I I what
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
really got me when I was thinking about
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
this last night I was say is that this
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
is not a new issue I mean we have been
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
the but it was always why Balan billing
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
exists and to have them come in with
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
that bill with balance building still
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
there to me that's a slap in the face I
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
mean that was really you here we are we
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
one task we asked them to work on and
 
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
come out with is like how to get rid of
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
balanced billing and all they can come
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
back is we just pay us more money and
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't sweat the balance billing and that
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's not right that's not right
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
okay how do people feel this is a straw
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
vote how do people feel with this
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
proposal of of having an Department come
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
up with a narrow uh language to just
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
focus in on the getting this the data
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
and have legislation ready for next year
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
as much as I hate to do this I agree
 
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.670 align:start position:0%
as much as I hate to do this I agree
with

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
some okay does anybody have uh any
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
opposition ition to that okay because we
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
open thank you Chris Day W was Halls New
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um appreciate the opportunity
 
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.750 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um appreciate the opportunity
to

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
ask if you are excuse me if you are
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
going to make that Amendment yes I would
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that number one
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me the direct pay remains because
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's a really important piece what is
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
the what do you mean by direct um part
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
of part of this bill compels the
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
insurers to direct pay oh yeah well we
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
already passed it y we already passed
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
that okay so to me that's that's the
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
whole reason why I was this legislation
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
my in my mind we should just interrup
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
stud it because we've already done
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
something huge Yep this year and I agree
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
with with the study you know that um I
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
would also ask that we make sure that
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
the services continue to have the
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
ability to balance bill while that study
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
is underway we are not there's no
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
balance we're not Banning balance
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
billing yet I just want to make make
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
sure that those two elements are still
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
in there because that's really important
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
but I I cannot emphasize enough that
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
until you come back with a bill that has
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
that bands balance Belling we're it's
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
going to fall on deaf ears for some of

01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
everybody Senator wants to buy me a
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
drink why that's cuz we do all those
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
fear bills that's another thing um
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just cut to the chase really fast
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
here and let the smart people from the
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
banking Association follow up so when
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
you go to apply for a mortgage entities
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
can purchase the information and that
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
results in consumers getting bombarded
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
with hundreds of calls people like me
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
and older we don't know what's going my
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
wife gets everything in the mail her
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
parents get stuff in the mail when
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
they're applying for loans and so we
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
want to limit the practice this
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
legislation will ban that practice it'll
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
leave an opin provision for the consumer
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
and they can also it has a carot
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
provision for communicating with
 
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
existing customers I should note that
 
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
there is currently a federal bipartisan
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
legislation that mirrors the proposed
 
01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
law before you however this practice is
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
affecting our constituents now there are
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
several representatives from the bankers
 
01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
behind me they're going to come with
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
much more factual information um but
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to do is protect
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
constituents and consumers from the
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
potential harm by companies who get
 
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
their information um and use it to
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
trigger leads to Mis misrepresent
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
themselves attempt to confuse or deceive
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
applicants or inundate them with direct
 
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
mailing it has recently come to my
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
attention also that there's confusion
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
between the potential for preemption
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
from the Fair Credit Reporting Act and
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
also interpretive rule from the Consumer
 
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
Financial Protection Bureau that
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
indicates state laws that are not
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
FCC including state laws that are more
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
protective of consumers than the FC a
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
general generally not preempted I know
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
that the house Commerce Committee will
 
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
do its due diligence in subcommittee and
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
give the bill consideration that it
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
deserves from predatory practices thank

01:04:57.069 --> 01:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
is not an instant opt out

the time it takes to process the opt out
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
is one to two weeks and it's too late
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
people have already gone and they

their credit is immediately

safe markets there are many mechanisms

for consumers to opt in to shop for

01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
bill before us is identical version of

proposed Federal legislation that has

Senator Maggie Hassen will will join
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
soon the bill also provides an optin and
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
allows for C consumers to choose if they
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
want to receive offers of credit the
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
question is are we legally allowed to
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
pass this bill at the state level
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
address that in your testimony but how
 
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
how does the certification process work
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what line seven line seven
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
I made a couple edits to mine this
 
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.630 align:start position:0%
I made a couple edits to mine this
morning

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
certified it says uh documentation to
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
such agency certifying that such third
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
part oh I'm sorry you're talking about
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm sorry
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
what were you talking about my testimony
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I don't have that document
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
yet yeah oh did I give you the
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
sry get that
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
to oh so this is the consumer certifying
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
they they are allowing the the
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
shared further question may inquire yeah
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
so so certifying seems to have like an
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
official connotation to it is are you
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
saying it's just the consumer some
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
document where the consumer agreed to
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
have their information shared excuse me
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
that is the opt-in provision yes okay
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you is okay uh represent William
 
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
is that on the Hippa form
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
no I don't I don't I can't answer that
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
question I don't know he's a mortgage
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
broker okay yes representative M uh
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman um maybe you don't
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this question but
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
periodically I believe a credit card
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
company that that I have periodically
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
they look at my credit report now maybe
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
when I signed up I gave them permission
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
is do you know any idea about because th
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
this I would believe might stop them
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
from doing that unless somehow I gave
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
them permission when I signed up for the
 
01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:40.189 align:start position:0%
them permission when I signed up for the
credit

01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
card I I will say credit cards are
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
different than
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
mortgages okay so they they don't
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily all pull from the same they
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
may only pull from one credit bureau um
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
and it's not the same uh
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
permissions okay thank you
 
01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.830 align:start position:0%
permissions okay thank you
representative

01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
P believe me I like the idea but if I
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
were to deal with a mortgage company
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
that was not in the state it this bill
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
would have no effect would it yes it
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
would because you live in the state if
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
your mortgage is for the
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
state if your resid you're applying for
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
a mortgage for would be within New
 
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
you okay uh I read this bill multiple
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
times and I'm I'm sure I there's
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
something I'm
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
missing if I uh decided to buy property
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
real estate secured by real estate and
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
um I am now going to see find I got to
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
get a mortgage part of my clothing I got
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
to have a mortgage so I call up my local
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
bank and I say I want to uh get a Mor Ag
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
and they're of course they're going to
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
ask me for my social security number and
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to do a credit
 
01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
check so I haven't talked to anybody I
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
haven't talked to any credit bureau or
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
anybody other than that mortgage broker
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to call that person at the
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
bank a mortgage broker I don't know if
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
they have the number or not but they're
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
the only ones I have given this
 
01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
information so you're saying when they
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
go and click and
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
onto let's call it Expedia because
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's who I have okay and and I have
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
I've unlocked that's why I have Expedia
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
I have it locked so I've unlocked it so
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
they can get my credit report so there's
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
a moment in time where it's unlocked and
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to get that information
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
and then theoretically I'll relock it
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
the next day because they've gotten
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
their information so where in that
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
process am I going to be opt in and opt
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
outing of having information from them
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
communicated to anybody so thank you
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
chairman that's a great question I I'm
 
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
going to give you a real life example of
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
myself two weeks ago that applied for a
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
mortgage okay um for a second home um
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
when that happened the mortgage company
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
uses a third party they use they use um
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
Birchwood services for example that pull
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
the credit from the three companies
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
TransUnion Equifax
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
and Experian um when that happens
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that time frame there is a
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
place where you can opt out I didn't
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
even see it myself when I did this wait
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
what did you do you all you I applied
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
for a mortgage did you talk to this
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
third party company or you talk to your
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
actual the the lender the lender the
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
lender and there supposedly there was on
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
that form there was an opt
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
out somewhere in that process there is
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
an opt out out for them to share your
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
information I don't know where it was I
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't know where it is um within 45
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
minutes of completing that application
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
my phone started ringing oh I
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
nonstop especially a company called
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
amasap they are Relentless I've blocked
 
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
calls I've done all kind they call from
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
different numbers um some of the
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
companies when you answer there's nobody
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
there then they they start talking some
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
of them pretend to be your lender so
 
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing for the consumer and
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'm in the business so I can't even
 
01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
imagine an elderly person somebody that
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know may have trouble with
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
understanding the process to begin with
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
um they get they get railroaded and they
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
get bombarded and harassed originally it
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
was created so that people had choice
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
but this has gone far beyond
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
choice they they it's harassing
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's what this bill is trying
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
to prevent where they can have a button
 
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
to opt in no I got it I got it so um is
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
it possible that you still have that
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
form or what you signed into or get
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
someone else to sign into it and and
 
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
then go find where this
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
opt in in opt out it was available I
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
mean how do you know how do you know
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
that they really actually did have that
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
question how do you know if that opt out
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
is actually really in
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
there I I would venture to say is I I I
 
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
mean it is true in most of these
 
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
documents we get there's a lot of fine
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
print and a lot of things and but I'm
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
sure you were very diligent and read all
 
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.430 align:start position:0%
sure you were very diligent and read all
of

01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
that and made sure that every little
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
square and especially if you were
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to initial that square yeah no
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
that you would have seen it so I'm I'm
 
01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
venturing to say is that maybe there not
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
isn't even that feature available to you
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
yeah would you believe I haven't applied
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
for mortgage for a little while but the
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
only feature I'm aware of is that
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's a online website opt out
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
pre-screen and you can go there and and
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
check a box and say you know I want to
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
opt out of any pre-screened leads um
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
there's also a phone number that's tied
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
into with that and I believe that the
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
credit Bure own that
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
website um
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
so if when consumers go there and they
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
opt out it still it takes one to two
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
weeks for that process to happen oh I
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
get that I get the I I'm just wondering
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
when where this is in the screen and
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
where is this in the process because I I
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
would have to say when uh I you know got
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
a mortgage I don't ever remember having
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
that screen show up I don't know that
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
there's ever been
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
anybody that that isre and and I'll
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
humor even more because remember I told
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
I was expedient and I
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
Expedia monthly Experian excuse me
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
Experian monthly ask me they say your
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
credit is so good you probably are
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
paying too much for auto insurance and
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
they want to sell me auto
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
insurance yeah I don't believe there is
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
a spot on the actual application to opt
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
out I I don't believe there is I and
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
some of the people behind can speak to
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
it um there is no place on the actual
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
mortgage application it would have to be
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
an outside
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
um website that the person would go to
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
separate from a mortgage right to opt
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
out and so it's even that is complicated
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
the reason why I say that is is is it
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
really the uh the credit bureaus are
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
doing it or that third-party company who
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
who is supposed to be doing that
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
background I'm betting they're the ones
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
who are selling it
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
yes so the problem is UN possibility for
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
us because if we're making legislation
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
about credit bureaus how do we control
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
these out
 
01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.830 align:start position:0%
these out
ofate

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
ofate
 
01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
uh companies that are are are
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
actually not doing what they're should
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
be doing which is Le giving you the
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to upt in or upt out they're
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
not even giving that because you don't
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
you know how you most of us probably
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
have no idea that there was a third-
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
party inventor involved even when we
 
01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
talk to our mortgage broker even talk to
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
the bank they're probably not going to
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
mention that it was a third party
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
it they
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
get beat up or complained against from
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
their customer that hey how am I why am
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
I getting all these leads um all these
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
messages and text messages and things
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
like that so they think it's the local
 
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
person that's caused that right and it's
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
not it's the Transunion eifax and
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
experience it's not them
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
no it's at that Source these third
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
parties have contracts with them to buy
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
pre-screen leads so they they they'll
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
put together a a you know I want a 700
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
score I want somebody that's you know
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
buying a $500,000 house and when these
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hits come in from the credit pull that
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
our local virtu with credit services
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
doing they have to come from from the
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
three okay and that's what causes that's
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
where the the lead is sold to these
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
bureaus okay and and I also take this
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to let everybody know
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
because this is a previous legislation
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
that after you've recorded that
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage that is now public information
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
and that there's these Mor these uh
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
insurance companies who want to sell you
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
mortgage insurance go down to to the
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and collects all those
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
recorded mortgages and sends you a
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
mailer and don't you know on the top of
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
that mailer is the name of your
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
financial institution that you got your
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage with so watch out for those yes
 
01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.950 align:start position:0%
mortgage with so watch out for those yes
represented

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
Texon well just so I'm
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
clear there's there's actually there's
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
three there's your lend your there's
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
your originating lender which might be a
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage broker or a bank or a credit
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
union and they've called for
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
consolidated credit report and score
 
01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
from a third-party company that then
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
goes and contacts the three major credit
 
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
bureaus uh TransUnion Equifax and
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
experion or Expedia if you like to
 
01:19:38.239 --> 01:19:39.950 align:start position:0%
experion or Expedia if you like to
travel

01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
travel
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill is to
 
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
stop which of those so it's not your
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
originating it's not your originating
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
lender and it's not the third party
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
company it's actually what you're saying
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly what
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying is it's the Bure it's the
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
three credit bureaus they're selling
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
this lead is that what and the goal of
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is contention is that it's the
 
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
credit bureau yes it is the three credit
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
bureaus that are selling these pre which
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
you might not have any relationship with
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
at all you've never even gone on to
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
their web page you but they have a
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
relationship with you because your all
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
of your creditors your credit card your
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
car payment whatever certainly know a
 
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
lot about they've reported
 
01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:27.639 align:start position:0%
all yeah they've I did one the other day
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
and they wanted they asked me about an
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
address that I had in 1979 and it's like
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
what um
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
so and your it's your feeling that this
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill would stop the the three credit
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
bureaus from selling that lead that's my
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
question it's what we're trying to do is
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
give them some more clear uh guard rails
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
the first is to offer the consumer the
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
right to opt in because currently
 
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
they're already opted in just by being a
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
consumer so they don't have a say unless
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
they go to the opt out prescreen website
 
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
and click there I want to opt out which
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
again is a delayed process
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
so even if that could be changed so that
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
the opt out is immediate it should be as
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
fast to opt out as it is for them to
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
sell the
 
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
leads well I agree with that you know
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
the Savings Bank of Walpole has I I can
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
opt out of them selling my information
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're very care and they very
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
carefully once a year send me a notice
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
and says this is what we do with your
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
information internally do we sell and my
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
credit card companies do and all that
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
but my my feeling is it and I believe me
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not here saying oh I think I love
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
credit bureaus I think that's great no I
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
think they should be constrainted but if
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
we agree to this bill my question is is
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
it is it going to actually do the job is
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
it going to stop the it's the credit
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
bureaus that are selling these leads to
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
other lenders and this bill is going to
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
put the brakes on them it should slow
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
them down and the third thing that it's
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
that it's designed to do is that it
 
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.350 align:start position:0%
that it's designed to do is that it
restricts

01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
restricts
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
the the pre-screen leads that they can
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
sell which are to somebody that has a
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
business relationship with them with a
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
mortgage um you know there's three
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
reasons in there
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
why but some but the customer they have
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
to have a a relationship with whoever
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
they're selling that lead to outside of
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
that somebody without a relationship it
 
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.510 align:start position:0%
that somebody without a relationship it
stops

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
stops
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
that so it would stop the bill this bill
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
would stop it from I go and get a
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
mortgage from the Savings Bank of
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
Walpole I have a relationship with them
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
and then it stops Equifax from selling
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
that lead to Wells Fargo for a car loan
 
01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair I just had
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
one further question the the
 
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
organization that you represent um
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're taking a position as an
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
organization on this legislation I just
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
I'm curious how does it affect your
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
business and your membership of your
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
organization uh you know obviously
 
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
there's some negative effect that your
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
membership has because of what's
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
Happening status quo so if you could
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
explain that please
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
well the negative effect of all the
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
complaints that come back to them
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
because their customers getting swamped
 
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
with all these leads and they can't
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
figure out where they're coming from so
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
as an association when we talked about
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
this bill we had
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
100% support because everybody wants
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
this cleaned up and it's a na it's a
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
nationwide issue it's it's that's why
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
there's so much support in DC it's just
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
nothing happens in DC so you have to
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
take it at a state level and that's sort
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
today I would say as an organization it
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect us directly but it
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
affects our members and so we're here in
 
01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
support of our
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
members representative M uh thank you um
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
so you recently filled out a mortgage
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
application wouldn't it make sense if
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
that opt in opt out was on the mortgage
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
application so when your bank goes to to
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
this third party right up front it says
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
you can't sell this or give this
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
information and if and again you said
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
you didn't see that on your mortgage
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
application but could something be put
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the law here that it that opt in opt
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
out has to be on the mortgage
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
application well that would be a cfpb
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
which you know oversees that um but that
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
would make sense I don't know that that
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
could be affected in the in the state
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
it's their form y all right it's a
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
federal form there's some other speakers
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
behind us that can speak to that bill
 
01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.350 align:start position:0%

Expedia I would like to put that on the

01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
for um as as you might imagine we are
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to to Senate Bill 332 um we view
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
it as anti-competitive and
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
anti-consumer uh it restricts the
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
ability of consumers to hear alternative
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
offers um from other Mortgage Bankers
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
and brokers who are subscribers to
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
mortgage trigger Services which are
 
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
Act um there's already a robust consumer
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
opt out provision you've heard some
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
misinformation this morning about the
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
time in which that is processed nothing
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
this bill would require anyone who is
 
01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:24.830 align:start position:0%
this bill would require anyone who is
offering

01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
offering
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
or working with a consumer on a mortgage
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
to actually present them with the opt
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
out or the opt in and so what we're
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
seeing and what I would point out is
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill really is going to harm
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
the ability of New Hampshire consumers
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
to potentially hear the best possible
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
offers out there and an environment
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
where interest rates are so incredibly
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
High a better offer means saving tens of
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars over the life of a
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
30-year mortgage um the FC has been
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
around since 1976 consumers have the
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to call 885 opt out if they
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
want to stop phone solicitations that's
 
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
managed by the Federal Trade Commission
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
or they can visit optoutprescreen.com
 
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
which will stop mail solicitations
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
either permanently or for five years and
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
that includes for credit card offers as
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
well prescreened offers of credit are
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
regulated by the FC they're also
 
01:28:13.229 --> 01:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
preempted by the FC we've heard a little
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
bit of conversation about the cfpb uh
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
what we call the advisory opinion we
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
think the cfpb was wrong on the process
 
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
they issued that without putting it
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
through the APA procedure required by
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
federal agencies in DC they issued it
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
also it's wrong on the law we've seen
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
court cases across the country that have
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
upheld the broad preemptive authority of
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
the Fair Credit Reporting Act as it
 
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
relates to prescreened offers of credit
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to go into that further
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
in Greater detail um but most
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
importantly in the cfpb opinion they're
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
discussing other provisions of law from
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
across the country regarding the
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
information contained in a consumer
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
report uh not
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily prescreened offers of credit
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
which are expressly preempted by the FC
 
01:28:58.510 --> 01:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
and I have that with me I'm happy to
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
walk through that as well um all in all
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
we think that this is a a bad Bill we
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
think this is a bill that is going to
 
01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
make it difficult for consumers to hear
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
the best offer it doesn't require any
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
lender Bank to actually disclose the
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
opt-in procedures if it wasn't preempted
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
um and so consider that um but happy to
 
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
take any questions I did want to answer
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
a few things that I heard uh from
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
previous questions um notably uh how
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
this process works so the FC requires
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
that when you apply for a credit card
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
when you apply for a loan when you apply
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
for a mortgage that application shows up
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
for a period of one year on your credit
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
report that information as well as your
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
name and phone number may be given to a
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
third party that does not have an
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
existing relationship with the consumer
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
this is a pre-screened offer of credit
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
um again consumers have the ability to
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
opt out from this if they do not want to
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
receive these but that would also stop
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
the offers to get credit cards in the
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
mail for the latest travel card or other
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
products that you may be interested in
 
01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
or offers to save money on your
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
insurance it would be
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
blanket um I'd also point out that we're
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
required to have that information on
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
there Federal Law requires us to include
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
those records as well as other things uh
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
so we would be in a situation where New
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law is saying we may not
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
share information that a federal law
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
says we may share if the consumer has
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
not opted out um and I'm happy to to go
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
just chapter and verse here very quick
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
um just for everyone to hear so General
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions no requirement or prohibition
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
may be imposed under the laws of any
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
state with respect to any subject matter
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
regulated under a subsection C or E of
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
section 604 of this title relating to
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
the prescreening of consumer reports
 
01:30:41.709 --> 01:30:41.719 align:start position:0%
that is the first section of what is
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
preempted by the FC from States
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
regulating what is being discussed here
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
today are pre-screened reports and thus
 
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
We Believe 332 would be preempted as
 
01:30:51.149 --> 01:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
other courts across the country have
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
found happy to answer any further
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
questions about the cfp uh
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
preemption and and how that would
 
01:30:57.679 --> 01:31:01.550 align:start position:0%
preemption and and how that would
work

01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I would have to
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
say personally that when
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
I let's go let's go to those classic
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
frequent fire Myers like JetBlue wanted
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
me to right on the airplane right
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're saying if you you know sign up
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
for this JetBlue credit card right now
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
will give you 50,000 or 75,000 points
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
right you know good for no trip so what
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just heard is is that if I were
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
foolishly enough to fill that out and I
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
can guarantee you there's nothing in
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
there that's going to tell me about opt
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
out or opt in okay there's nothing in
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
there um what I like in this to be is
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
more like um don't you know that uh you
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
can uh call up there's a an email
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
address called do not call MH and so but
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
I have to remember that that fires every
 
01:31:57.229 --> 01:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
eight years so I have to go back on
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
every eight years and put my all my
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
phone numbers back in again to get rid
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
of the Do Not calls all right so what
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is is that what we have here
 
01:32:07.629 --> 01:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
is an in there is an entity to stop all
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
this junk mail to stop all this stuff
 
01:32:12.189 --> 01:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
you just have to know about it so I
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
would urge the mortgage brokers to make
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
sure when your customer is signing up
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
that you do give them a little piece of
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
paper with that phone number or email
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
address to say immediately and when they
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
because I foolishly thought there was a
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
right of privacy here I I really did not
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
think that my application where I
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
foolishly write my annual income and I
 
01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
will say with the mic on I don't give
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
that know IRS gets good numbers all
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
right that that having said that that
 
01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
that form is sitting around hanging
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
around for a year and and and then who
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
knows can go go look at it and then send
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
me you know more Airline flight frequent
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
fire Mouse Okay so it is a little
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
bothersome to know that the system is
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
such that getting credit that I when I
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
when I go to my Experian and turn it off
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
and give a credit report to somebody
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
that all of a sudden that is now being
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
public information all over so yes I I
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
would say is I I don't envy you in your
 
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.350 align:start position:0%
would say is I I don't envy you in your
job

01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day the federal
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
government should resolve this problem
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
because this is not right okay this is
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
really not right if I if I may chair I I
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
just want to provide a little bit of
 
01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
clarification about what is shared in a
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
pre-screened mortgage trigger okay
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
limits on the information received under
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph 1B the name and address of a
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
consumer and identifier that is not
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
unique to the consumer that used by the
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
person solely for the purpose of
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
verifying the identity of the consumer
 
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
other information pertaining to a
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
consumer that does not identify the
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
relationship or experience of the
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
consumer with respect to a particular
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
creditor or entity so federal law also
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
prohibits us from sharing a pre-existing
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
relationship with a creditor to another
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
creditor except our mailing address yes
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
it does allow the share of the address
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
right so then they can do their
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
profiling based upon my mailing address
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right I think I got it now
 
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and the other question
 
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.470 align:start position:0%
thank you and the other question
represent

01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
Solan um well first of all I like your
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
um they're good luck it's like
 
01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.629 align:start position:0%
um they're good luck it's like
a

01:34:31.629 --> 01:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
like anyways um so I mean I you know I
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
always I always sort of kind of roll my
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
eyes a little bit when people say you're
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
looking out for my best interest by
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
selling my data and making money off of
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
my data I mean that's just I mean it's I
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't think that Rings particularly
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
sincere to probably the majority of
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
people in this room because all of of us
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
are annoyed by the junk mail we get all
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
of us are annoyed by the text messages
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
and phone calls we get and all of us are
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
annoyed by the emails being sold I mean
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
I have an
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
entirely my email account from that I my
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
very first one I ever created back in
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
high school is now just my soul junk
 
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
anything I sign up for I have to sign up
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
with that because it is such a problem
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
right everything is sold and at the end
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
of the day like yes there might be
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
people who are benefiting from the
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
ability to see a bunch of offers sent to
 
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
them when you're over welmed with a lot
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
of offers it's really hard to Screen
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
through those I mean that in itself
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
takes a separate set of skills when you
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
are I mean there was a time a while back
 
01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
where I was looking to refinance a home
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
and I mean I had what was described by
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker where I mean within
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
seconds of filling something out I had
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
so many phone calls I was like I can't
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
keep up with this like this is like this
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
is overwhelming me and I'm not at that
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
time I was probably like 30 I I I'm not
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
somebody in my 70s who could beat easily
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed right so you know I don't
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
understand why we need to have a opt in
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
opt out instead of an opt
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
in so thank you for the the question
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
represent I think Point points certainly
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
understood I think this is the challenge
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
where we run into the state law would
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
conflict with the federal law the
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
federal law says that these products are
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
legal and lawful under the FC that they
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
can uh be offered and that many mortgage
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
bankers and Brokers rely on them to find
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
leads um I think we are in an
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
environment because of high interest
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
rates that there is a smaller pool and
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
that we have seen historically that as
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
those rates rise and fall this issue
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
pops up to the Forefront time and again
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
um but the FC does allow for us to share
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
a consumer report relating
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
to uh these these um transactions if
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's not initiated by the consumer if
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
the transaction consists of a firm offer
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
of credit or insurance and the consumer
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
reporting agency is complying with SE
 
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
section e um which means which deals
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
with the opt out sections and so for
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
right now federal law says there is an
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
opt out procedure and it must be
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
respected other states who have looked
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
at this issue have looked at the
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
requirements imposed on users of these
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
Services uh other states like
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts have codified uh
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
violations of those requirements is
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive trade practices so
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
again this is not we're is not Experian
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
or Equifax or TransUnion making the
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
phone calls to Consumers it's mortgage
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
brokers and it's Bankers who are
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
subscribed to these Services competing
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
over the same number of mortgages that
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
are being written or not written and
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
they are the ones making the call
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's you know laws that require clear
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
disclosure um that uh the person calling
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
identify that they are not with the
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
originating lender um as far as mail
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
prescreened that you get the junk mail
 
01:37:52.109 --> 01:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
the credit card offers or mortgage
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
offers you get in the mail um If you're
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
receiving written solicitations they
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
must be accompanied with a notice that
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
the consumer has the right to opt out
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
from such solicitations the FC requires
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
this notice to be in a manner that is
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
simple and easy to understand the FDC
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
has determined that to meet the
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
statutory criteria the notice of the
 
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
right opt out must be in two places and
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
must be clear and so right now FC and
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
the FCC have looked at this and said
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
there has to be an opt out there is an
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
opt out in statute and so that is what
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
is available to Consumers and the FC
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
also says that state laws that attempt
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
to create additional restrictions on the
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
use of these products would be preempted
 
01:38:29.589 --> 01:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
and the cfpb opinion does get into that
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
as it talks about specific sections of
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
Statute that are specifically referenced
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the preemption section uh and the
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
subject matter regulated thereunder and
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
subsection C uh is Furnishing reports in
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
connection with credit or Insurance
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
transactions that are not initiated by
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
the consumer and so that is
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
preempted follow
 
01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:51.430 align:start position:0%
preempted follow
up

01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
so I mean I ended up with a question
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
question um so is your is a position of
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
you and your agency that you're
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about the conflict between
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
state and federal law or is the position
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
that we should actually have opt opt out
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
as the default or op versus opt in like
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
like if if the feds change it would you
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
guys be fighting against an opt in
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
change so consumer reporting agencies
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
are repositories of information
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
regarding credit transactions and other
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
identifying information that is used to
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
verify and price right and so we are
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
like the library people give us
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
information we hold to it furnishers
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
like Banks provide us that information
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and so we are not actually engaging
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
directly with the consumer in most
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
instances the information is provided to
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
us the government the covenants
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the Furnishing that
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
information are heavily regulated the FC
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
heavily regulates what and how it can be
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
furnished um nothing in this bill would
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
require a mortgage Banker broker to
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
either inform a consumer that they have
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
the right to opt out or require them to
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
opt into sharing and talking with our
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
member companies they say it takes
 
01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
between 24 to 48 hours to process an opt
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
out notice um and again it's if you opt
 
01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
out through the website that's for mail
 
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
you have to call the FTC to opt out via
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
phone and so we get the information
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
about an application for mortgage from a
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
mortgage Banker or mortgage broker that
 
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
is compiled that information submitted
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
to us at that point we have to put it on
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
the consumer's credit file to comply
 
01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
with federal law at that point other
 
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
subscribers to mortgage trigger services
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
are legally allowed to be notified that
 
01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
is a consumer that fits profile X that
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
has applied for a transaction and that
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
is what triggers uh that disclosure and
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
in some cases it may get a better deal
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
in some cases they may get 75 phone
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
calls but one more
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
try give it up he's just repeating
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
himself he's going to keep reading the
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
same thing over and over and hope that
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to I was hoping to get just
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
an answer the position would be like if
 
01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
they if the feds tried to change and
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
make it opt in instead of opt out you
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
guys would oppose that so the federal
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
the changes if you can't answer that
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
just stop he's not going to answer that
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
question he's not gonna answer that
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
question he's
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
not okay representative
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
spear he said that there was a uh do not
 
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
call thing that you can call up with the
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
government I did that month after month
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
after month and it never stopped
 
01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
anything it never had any effect so what
 
01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
exactly is that do
 
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
well the FTC has to enforce it and if
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
their calls are coming from outside the
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
country I don't know where the ftc's
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
regulatory reach ends but if there are
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
us-based Mortgage Bankers or mortgage
 
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
brokers calling you in violation of the
 
01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
FTC and do our call list then uh under
 
01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
some state laws that comply with the FC
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
that would be an unfair and deceptive
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
trade practice that various enforcement
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms may be available to Consumers
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
there I would say the best way the best
 
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
trick I had in dealing with that um a
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
you can get rid of your land landline
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
because it's landline okay but B is what
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
I had right next to my phone is I had a
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
a a piece of paper and they would start
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
out saying the organization and I said
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
um I would confirm it so you said this
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
is the or get I get them to confirm the
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
organization great so I want you to know
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
that um I'm writing down this call that
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
I'm about to tell you to do not call and
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
if you call again I will ensure that I
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
can now tell the FTC exactly when you
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
call called what time you called and
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
that I told you to put me on the Do Not
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
Call List and I'll tell you it has been
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
successful I got to tell you what I
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
did the problem you have I have to tell
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
you what I did when when I got those
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
phone calls I said you are calling into
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
a secure facility in Area
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
51 if you don't get off the phone no no
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
your phone is going to be traced and
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing and getting rid of
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
the landline was the only thing that
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
stopped it the with these lists that
 
01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
they have is that you get on these do
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%

Mumbai India gets that list and then
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
they call that list they call that list
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%

01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
I've been in the banking business for
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
almost 30 years um Senate Bill 332
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
before you was designed to protect
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
consumers who in very simple terms have
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
had their credit pulled in relation to a
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
transaction involving real estate
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
at present when a hard credit poll is
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
done a person's information is sold in
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
many different ways by the credit
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
reporting repositories as a lead even
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
though the lender is paid for that
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
credit beerer in the first place and the
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
hard poll was authorized by them the by
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
the consumer to them from this point I
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
call it literally Off to the Races as
 
01:44:44.589 --> 01:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
you've heard with a previous speaker
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
before me with the amount of calls and
 
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
emails and text messages that they will
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
get from other lenders who have
 
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
purchased their information um I offer
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
you the following real life life example
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh one of my colleagues had a call with
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
a borrower on the 7th of April a Sunday
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
for a loan request uh he was lucky
 
01:45:02.830 --> 01:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
enough to put a home under agre which is
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
extremely hard to do not only in New
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but really across the country
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
due to lack of inventory the application
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the credit poll were done Sunday the
 
01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
7th in the early afternoon by Wednesday
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
the loan officer checked in with the
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
client to let him know the loan was
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
moving through to processing Wednesday
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
the 10th the client reported back to the
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
loan officer there were literally 200
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
phone calls to his cell phone his
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
voicemail box was filled up twice
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
because he kept deleting the messages
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then gave up so aside from being
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
what I would consider overly aggressive
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
on the part of the lead callers the
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
client had no ability for anyone in his
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
family or otherwise to leave a message
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
because of these calls many of these
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
telemarketers I call them are licensed
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
but they are very koi in what they say I
 
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
will not go so far as to say that they
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
are breaking the law but in my
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
professional opinion they are less than
 
01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
forthcoming and unethical in the way
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
they speak with people their statements
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
mislead some who do not do this stuff
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing every day and they
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
may not pay attention verbatim to what
 
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
they say I've had my own clients
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
mistakingly think they are helping a
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
member of my processing team and have
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
accidentally applied for credit
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
elsewhere this becomes a problem in some
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
cases for the clients because multiple
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
credit scores can reduce their score and
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
if their scores on the edge of a
 
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
particular program or rate tier that
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
could offer them a discount they may
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
lose it they may lose an approval all
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
together in one case a client of mine
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
unknowingly applied with the existing
 
01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
servicer who also originates and because
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
of that application we lost her
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
appraisal waiver which is a a waiver we
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
get through an automated system that
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
says you don't need an appraisal because
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
we accept your value uh we lost her
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
appraisal waiver this delayed her
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
closing and it added the cost of an
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
appraisal because we had to rush an
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
appraisal to meet a closing deadline
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
because we lost it due to this confusion
 
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
on her part so that was as a result of
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
the other lenders action she thought she
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
was helping us out um I understand that
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's pending Federal legislation we
 
01:46:59.470 --> 01:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
talked about that earlier in Washington
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
regarding this topic um and there may be
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
a thought for some of you to wait on the
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
feds to solve this problem but I urge
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
you not to and I don't need to share
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
with any of you in this room that
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
Washington is broken I don't care on
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
what side of the aisle you sit um and it
 
01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
could really take a lesson on how things
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
happen from all of you here in New
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think we do it well and we
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
do it better um I think the speaker down
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
there wakes up every day wondering if he
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
has a job and he's trying to read tea
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
leaves um I don't envy him um none of
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
that nonsense helps get a bill passed
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it leaves us without being able to
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
protect consumers um which is what we're
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
trying to do here so um I have before
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
you a copy of the ficra ruling and I'd
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to entertain any questions
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
because I actually do this every day so
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
me great thank you I think we're all
 
01:47:50.189 --> 01:47:50.199 align:start position:0%
questioned out all right wonderful well
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me all right thank
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
D good morning Mr chairman chairman hunt
 
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
and the members of the committee uh my
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
name is Charlie D and I work for the New
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Mutual Bank Corp which is
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
Meredith Village Savings Bank savings
 
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
Bank of walpool and marac County Savings
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
Bank uh as many of you aware when you
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
buy a house it's the biggest purchase of
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
your lifetime generally it's it's a
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
really big deal for it's a it's a filled
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
with anxiety and stress uh and as a
 
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
community bank we do a lot of them and
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
we have a trust relationship with the as
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
the custodians of our clients money so
 
01:48:44.910 --> 01:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
they trust
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
us so when they apply for Real Estate
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
loan they often do it at night or early
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
in the morning when they when they're
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
not at work
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
so they can focus and get everything
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
together uh they provide all of their
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
information so after they submit it and
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
agree to have their credit pulled
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
because you can't really figure out if
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
you're credit worthy without having your
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
credit pulled the phone starts ringing
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
starts ringing
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
Non-Stop and for people who have English
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
as a second language or people who are
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
elderly they pick the phone up and they
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
just assume it's the bank calling
 
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
because they just applied they're like
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
wow these guys are good they call me
 
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:24.270 align:start position:0%
wow these guys are good they call me
right

01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:25.790 align:start position:0%
right
away

01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if it's intentional or
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
unintentional but the people that are
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
calling are really playing off on that
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
um and that that's a problem especially
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
for people want to do a reverse
 
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
mortgage they're doing reverse mortgage
 
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
because they run out of money they got
 
01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:41.719 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to get some money out
 
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
of their house so they can continue to
 
01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:45.350 align:start position:0%
of their house so they can continue to
survive

01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
survive
 
01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
um we we have to figure out a
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
way to stop this right we can agree that
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation federally and what have
 
01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
you but it's not working so as state
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
legislators we have the opportunity to
 
01:49:59.470 --> 01:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
take a look at this problem and figure
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
out a way to solve it the way that we do
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
things in New Hampshire for our people
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
um the fear and anxiety that comes up on
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
these people when they start getting
 
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
2030 calls and then they can't even
 
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
figure out who they're supposed to call
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes they haven't spoken to the
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
loan officer yet they talked to the
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
person at you know at the bank their
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
banker and they said just go online and
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
apply and then they'll call it so it's
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a relatively large problem
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
and it's it's impacting our
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
questions I guess we're all said thank
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
you we have no more cards so we'll close
 
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
start represent I wish You' been in the
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
I thought I was going to do my last bill
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
in front of you it was
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
um uh whether ra should be counted as
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
employees or not I thought that would
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
have come to you it was so it it
 
01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
colleges right now in Ira is not
 
01:51:13.069 --> 01:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
considered anlo
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
and they want to treat them as employees
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
well so they can tax them yeah know I
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
thought you'd get it so I was like I
 
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything I did a half hour
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
of talking I hate coming in reading
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
things bothers
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%

you um again uh the folks at the New
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Tech Alliance came to me and
 
01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:43.639 align:start position:0%
they said um about sponsoring a piece of
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
legislation I said no I got too many
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
bills right um but they said no we'll do
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
the heavy work and I said well what's it
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
about and they said we're losing funds
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have startup Tech
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
businesses but we don't get any direct
 
01:52:58.589 --> 01:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
support so they said we're losing
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities we're watching them go to
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
other states and we would like
 
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
to have a commission and the ideas to
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
get people to work with um diverse
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
startup companies to get a better
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of the opportunities and
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
they identify the steps so I have very
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%

been multiple National reports that rank

New Hampshire incredibly low in

of 50 states respectfully indicators

New Hampshire scores poorly across a
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
variety of reports we can simply
 
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
speculate why this is the case but a
 
01:55:34.069 --> 01:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
study commission will allow us to
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensively map existing resources
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
for ENT entrepreneurs in our state it
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
will identify areas for improvement and
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
promot promote cross- sector initiatives
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
that strengthen our entrepreneurial
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
ecosystem and consequently the overall
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
economy building robust Innovative
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
innovation ecosystems requires
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration from all stakeholders
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
public private and Academia it depends
 
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
on long-term Vision that transcends
 
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
political cycles and partis and agendas
 
01:56:04.030 --> 01:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
establishing a study commission is the
 
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
pivotal first step toward creating a
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
shared Vision it provides the technology
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
sector and our legislators the
 
01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to collaboratively work
 
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
towards Solutions tailored to our state
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire Tech
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
Alliance board of directors membership
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
and Technology sector as a whole I ask
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
for your support in moving this critical
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
legislation forward happy to take any
 
01:56:26.069 --> 01:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
spe okay if you've ever uh participated
 
01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
or have seen some of our study
 
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
commissions there are a few that have
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
been successful most have not it seems
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
to me that the kind of information that
 
01:56:46.719 --> 01:56:48.109 align:start position:0%
to me that the kind of information that
you

01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
want you folks and your Association are
 
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
in a best position to tell us what needs
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
to be done rather than us trying to who
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
have don't have the group experience
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
that you have so it seems to me a better
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
approach might be for you to tell us
 
01:57:10.069 --> 01:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
what you need and then us for us to work
 
01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
on it rather than go the other way
 
01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
around so my suggestion would be try
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
that approach instead uh representative
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
gosh I would hate to just come in here
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
and tell you exactly what to do and walk
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
out of the building
 
01:57:26.109 --> 01:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh but certainly yeah know I I
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the comment you know I think
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
our the the alliance uh looks at this as
 
01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.470 align:start position:0%
our the the alliance uh looks at this as
an

01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh you know I'd say two or
 
01:57:37.229 --> 01:57:37.239 align:start position:0%
three-fold first to work collaboratively
 
01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
with legislators to educate to
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
understand the issue Better B to work
 
01:57:43.629 --> 01:57:43.639 align:start position:0%
together to look at Best Practices
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
across States and see what New Hampshire
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
could do that is uniquely New Hampshire
 
01:57:51.790 --> 01:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
and have buyin from the beginning rather
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
than come in here and just tell you what
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
we think is best and then go through a
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
process which is questioning why are you
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
doing this why are you doing that where
 
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
we have answered all of that in
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
collaboration with all of you so we
 
01:58:04.109 --> 01:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
think this is an opportunity to work
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
together uh and hopefully in in a
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
relatively efficient and effective
 
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
process uh over the coming you know six
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
to eight months come up with
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh and move forward with
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
the state collaboratively I have a
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
question representative Ammon is
 
01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
next thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony um I'm just out of
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
curiosity uh I have two related
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
questions um what what industries do you
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire could uh capture
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
what growth industries are there that
 
01:58:35.709 --> 01:58:35.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could capture and secondly
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
what impediments do you see uh that the
 
01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
state government could help with uh in
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
overcoming yeah good questions and I
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to necessarily speak out of
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
turn because while I chair the
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
government Affairs committee s the board
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of different
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
sectors that could benefit that I uh can
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
only kind of speak anally to I may ask
 
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
Taylor Grande who works on our startup
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
initiative to also speak to this because
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
I think uh she has a bit more knowledge
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
into the specific sectors but just kind
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
of off the top of Mind in terms of where
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
we can benefit I think biomedtech is one
 
01:59:10.350 --> 01:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
of those places uh certainly AI as we
 
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
are struggling and trying to figure out
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
how AI uh is going to work across the
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
board uh and how that you know impacts
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
our startup Community uh certainly I
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
think there's opportunity there uh but I
 
01:59:23.229 --> 01:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
think just broadly when we're looking at
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
kind of the startup Community as an
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
ecosystem as a whole you know it doesn't
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
really necessarily depend on which
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
sector we are are lacking in New
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire across the board in terms of
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a state supported ecosystem and
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
then you talk about where could these
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
State be helpful um I don't want to
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily assume uh because I think
 
01:59:45.310 --> 01:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
there could be a lot of opportunities
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
Taylor worked uh in other states helping
 
01:59:49.069 --> 01:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
them to build their ecosystem so I would
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
ask actually Taylor to to flag exactly
 
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
where some of those places were if if
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's all right with the chair to have
 
01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
Taylor come up and quickly address the
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
question of course I have a question
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
when she sits down
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
okay good morning I'm gonna huddle over
 
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
here I'm about six months pregnant so
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
give me some time to Waddle uh good
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
morning everyone um like I Scott said
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
I'm Taylor Grande I just moved to New
 
02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from Colorado where I was the
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
CEO of um a uh multi-million dollar uh
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide nonprofit organization called
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
startup Colorado that was originally
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
founded um under the startup America
 
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
initiative uh and was founded by our
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
state attorney general Phil Weiser and a
 
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
gentleman named Brad Feld who was the
 
02:00:35.069 --> 02:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
co-founder of tech stars um which is an
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
accelerator program uh to help early
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
stage Tech startups across the world so
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
good to see everyone today and I can
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
help answer any questions that I have
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
but I am fairly new to the
 
02:00:48.270 --> 02:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
state ask your
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
question yeah if I could just repeat the
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
same question um I think we heard Ai and
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
biotech um just what industries could we
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
Foster so we can get ahead of the curve
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
and uh how did Colorado assist as a
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
state government I mean it's a
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
completely different state so let's just
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
it's a elephant in the room there the
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
tax you know the tax system is different
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
the the size of the state government is
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
is quite different um the types of
 
02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
companies that are coming out of
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
Colorado are quite different than we're
 
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
seeing here in New Hampshire but uh it
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
was across the board in terms of
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
Industry I think Scott you're you're
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
right in saying that to make assumptions
 
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
around a specific area sector industry
 
02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
um when you take a look at at Colorado
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
we had such success because we were open
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
to all Industries we had a we had a lot
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
of advanced manufacturing we had outdoor
 
02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
recreation um as early stage companies
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
you know Tech is Tech most people think
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
of tech because you think of of Shark
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
Tank right it's it's Chang the way that
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
we think about investing uh in early
 
02:01:51.149 --> 02:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
stage companies from a VC landscape um
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
but so manyan outside of tech um are are
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
receiving outside Capital um you know to
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
help them scale at an early stage and
 
02:02:03.069 --> 02:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
and along every every stage of their
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
company's life cycle so I would need to
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
take a look at um you know at what
 
02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
industries have seen success here um but
 
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
Colorado there's a lot of good models to
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
take a look at from Colorado um you know
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to to talk through and
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
in other states as well I think the
 
02:02:20.910 --> 02:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm most excited about coming
 
02:02:24.669 --> 02:02:24.679 align:start position:0%
here as a as a new number is that um you
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
know study commissions can uh can can be
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
a waste of time but they can also be
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
really really pivotal in terms of
 
02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
collaboration with state government
 
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
because you're walking hand inand taking
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
a look at what the big problems are and
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
how to assess those from a startup
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
ecosystem development landscape and and
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
we did that um in Colorado we had you
 
02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
know the the board of the uh the Bea
 
02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
here it's equivalent it's their office
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
of Economic Development and
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
international trade for Colorado um that
 
02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
that person who spaned it across uh
 
02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.790 align:start position:0%
that person who spaned it across uh
multiple

02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
administrations sat on our board uh of
 
02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.069 align:start position:0%
administrations sat on our board uh of
Directors

02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
Directors
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
for nine years um and really was a
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
pivotal partner for
 
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
us and real quickly uh represent amayan
 
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
just to kind of continue answering your
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
question um opportunities for where the
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
state could be really helpful uh working
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
with the private sectors first of all I
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
I think um what Senator Gan mentioned in
 
02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
terms of a lot of money being left on
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
the table I think a lot of VC's and
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
early stage investors look for uh a
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
supportive ecosystem before they look to
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
invest in startup communities and
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
startup companies um and I think just a
 
02:03:36.669 --> 02:03:36.679 align:start position:0%
a general hey we are supportive we're
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
working and vote with the private sector
 
02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
to help support the startup community be
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
that you know whether it's uh
 
02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
financially or otherwise certainly I
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of opportunities
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
for the state to kind of extand that
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
that hand and really say that hey we're
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
open for for business but specifically
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to work with the startup
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
community and do what we can to help
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
Foster a really diverse and dynamic
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
ecosystem okay uh Nas
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
next thanks for taking my question this
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
is a would you believe um if there is a
 
02:04:08.069 --> 02:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
commission I think that it will be
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
really important to figure out where
 
02:04:11.470 --> 02:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to house workers because we
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
can't house the people that we have now
 
02:04:15.390 --> 02:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
that's a huge problem in Colorado as
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
well okay it's tough um it's a national
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
Problem Child Care is the same way it's
 
02:04:21.390 --> 02:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
the reason that we left Colorado in you
 
02:04:24.109 --> 02:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
know so Workforce is obviously a huge uh
 
02:04:25.629 --> 02:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
retracted for folks who are starting
 
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
businesses here but because there is
 
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
such a strong landscape um you know in
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the tax burden for for
 
02:04:34.589 --> 02:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
employees that's a great way to to
 
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
attract the workforce here but they're
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
they're up against so many other issues
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce childcare as you mentioned um
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
you know I met with a I was just meeting
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
with a an investor yesterday morning and
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
he said you know I wouldn't start a
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
business anywhere else except New
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I'm but I'm puzzled why
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
there aren't more companies that are
 
02:04:54.189 --> 02:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
starting in New Hampshire because
 
02:04:55.470 --> 02:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere to live there's nowhere
 
02:04:58.030 --> 02:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
to live right that's but but it's
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
multifaceted you know when you when you
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
take a look at the resources that are
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
available from a Statewide
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
landscape it's there's there's certainly
 
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
gaps um when you talk about the early
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
stage if you look at if you look at an
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
ecosystem of companies as a pipeline and
 
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
you are expecting we're all wanting more
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
second stage scalable companies to exist
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
to start and scale and remain here in in
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you can't get to that
 
02:05:26.109 --> 02:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
second stage Point unless you're tending
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
to the top of the funnel across all
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
Industries and sectors and and providing
 
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
resources at every level or every stage
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
of a company's life cycle so yes child
 
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
you know childcare and Healthcare huge
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
issues but I think what we're experts in
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
is really providing the business support
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
and being laser focused in that and
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
partnering with those folks on on the
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
economic development lens you know to to
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
solve these multitude of
 
02:05:53.069 --> 02:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
problems question I wish you good luck I
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
really do and I don't mean that I don't
 
02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
mean that in a snarky way I really don't
 
02:05:57.880 --> 02:05:59.109 align:start position:0%
mean that in a snarky way I really don't
repres

02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
repres
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
bam thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question Scott this one is for
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
you um does the state have a um
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
Innovative fund um sort of a grant
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
process the state sets aside some money
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
for innovators in the state do you know
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
anything about not that I believe so no
 
02:06:17.470 --> 02:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
not right now and and and that's you
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
know certainly when I when I was in my
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
original testimony uh had FL you know
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
certain Awards Grant Awards and
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh for the state to
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
partner um and and I don't believe that
 
02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
we do have anything like that but I also
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
think you know it's not just the state
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
funding but also you know there could be
 
02:06:37.549 --> 02:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
Federal opportunities that flow through
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
the state right um that we should be
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
looking out for as well but again those
 
02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
are all things that I think the
 
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
commission would look at to see how can
 
02:06:47.069 --> 02:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and its own way uh
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
identify opportunities be it's state
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
federal or otherwise uh to help support
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
and promote yeah there was a fund years
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh years ago because I remember going to
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
some you know uh
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
exhibits um so if that's no longer
 
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
available from the state then yeah and
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
and I know there are uh and I'm not
 
02:07:06.549 --> 02:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
overstating here there are literally
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars kind of just sitting
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
on the table um if and when there's a
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
fund available uh for matching funds
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
yeah there was the mil Works fund as you
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
might may remember Mill Works fund one
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
and two that received some um some
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
capital and investment from the BFA um a
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
while back but that's not active in
 
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
terms of capital investment right now so
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
I I have a little bit to offer here um
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
on my on my other life I sit on a family
 
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
foundation and uh and I'm on the energy
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee and the state of Ohio put up a
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars to create the bright
 
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.589 --> 02:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
innovators and the bright in five C3 and
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
they and they they put in feed startup
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
monies a couple hundred, here couple
 
02:08:01.709 --> 02:08:01.719 align:start position:0%
100,000 there and and get these
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
Innovative and and it's all focused on
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
energy now I say that only because um
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
you guys don't give yourself a lot of
 
02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:14.679 align:start position:0%
time to get anything done here this bill
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
your your effective date you know
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
passage which as we know that's the end
 
02:08:20.669 --> 02:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
you know sometime in June but you're
 
02:08:22.510 --> 02:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to you're all done by November
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
1st did you mean to do that we in the
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
small business sector like to be
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
efficient as effective as possible with
 
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
our time and yours but if you believe
 
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
certainly chairman in your wisdom uh and
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
experience in doing this that that date
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
should be extended we are uh happy to
 
02:08:43.149 --> 02:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
entertain an amendment to do so uh we
 
02:08:45.390 --> 02:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
hope that we can bring together the
 
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
right group of people and get this work
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
done quickly uh to make recommendations
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the next legisl session but again uh
 
02:08:55.229 --> 02:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I would well given you know
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
you got all these different appointees
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
and my experience is that you're lucky
 
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
to get them all appointed by the end of
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
August so yes you have to be a model of
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency you're going to three months
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
to get it done so uh we might want to
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
look at that ABS but U having said that
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
that reason why model legislation has
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
that date in there is that they keep
 
02:09:18.189 --> 02:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
telling us they don't want these
 
02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
commissions and they they're so which
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
begs the question
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
is uh why isn't who was the tech you
 
02:09:26.589 --> 02:09:26.599 align:start position:0%
were why isn't the tech Alliance why
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
aren why aren't you guys laying the
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
ground work to create this nonpr create
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit that people can give money
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
they they're all begging they all got
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
that money out there they just need an
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
entity to give it to and get that going
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe you know you know mean I
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
understand we can get you this
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
commission but the amount of or your
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
organization to get the meetings OCC to
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
get them on time and before you know it
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
your your clocks run out on you so I
 
02:09:54.549 --> 02:09:54.559 align:start position:0%
just hope you have all that in mind two
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
two thoughts certainly Happ been happy
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
to consider extending the day of the
 
02:10:01.790 --> 02:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
commission um but there is no really
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
nowhere for that money to go because
 
02:10:05.069 --> 02:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
it's not just that the money's there
 
02:10:07.149 --> 02:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
it's that they're looking for a partner
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
in the state right you got to create the
 
02:10:10.350 --> 02:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofit well it's not even a nonprofit
 
02:10:12.189 --> 02:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
they're looking for the state government
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
to be involved and To Be A Champion to
 
02:10:15.870 --> 02:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
be part of this process help you're
 
02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:17.559 align:start position:0%
looking for us to put money in not
 
02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily and I think that's the
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of this commission is that like
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
yes is that an opportunity absolutely
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
but there are other ways for the state
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
to also be a partner in the startup
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
ecosystem be it financially or otherwise
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
so I think there are I guess I guess
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is rethink that because
 
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
Ohio did it a different way and there's
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
a successful and it's operating and it's
 
02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
actually working so they if you're if
 
02:10:45.069 --> 02:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
you're depending upon the state to
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
create an entity an agency or something
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
to have some ownership that you're
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to be wasting your time you
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
know because we we don't do that you as
 
02:10:55.069 --> 02:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
you probably
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
know I know we are careful with our
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
money for sure
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative Herbert you can
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
have your question okay thanks um thank
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
you that was what you just discussed was
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
my first thought and that is where
 
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
where's the money going to come from now
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I don't have any idea as
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
to whether the states other states have
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
got a conduit uh for federal funds and
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
and if and if they do what did they do
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
in order
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
to uh access that money because this
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
state is to say it's Frugal is a gross
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
underst understanding that's a good
 
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
thing yeah so um but that was the second
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
my second thought is that there's a lot
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
of money in this state and there are
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:11:53.229 --> 02:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
investors private equity investors
 
02:11:53.239 --> 02:11:54.950 align:start position:0%
investors private equity investors
billionaires

02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
billionaires
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
who have houses here and live here and
 
02:12:02.669 --> 02:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
and and to have a state agency be
 
02:12:07.629 --> 02:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
created with a that kind of um focus
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
probably would be relatively inexpensive
 
02:12:14.589 --> 02:12:14.599 align:start position:0%
but uh pretty effective so I've got two
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions there number one how are we
 
02:12:18.750 --> 02:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to get how are we getting fall uh
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
failing to get Federal funding through
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
our Congressional Delegation or whatever
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
purpose and two uh as a I think it is a
 
02:12:32.549 --> 02:12:32.559 align:start position:0%
good idea although the chair is
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
skeptical that the state would have fund
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
a uh has to be two or three people you
 
02:12:41.310 --> 02:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
know this is not a big deal in this
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
state you have can go out and and gain
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
capital and of course there's it's a
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
two-way street so if somebody comes
 
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
along and says
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I think I'd like to you know I
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
can spend you know like $50 million we
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't want you to do that so thank you
 
02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
you don't want me to do what keep going
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
you ask your question I okay my question
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
is you got it I think he got
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
question yes yes so again I'm new to New
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but for I can only speak for
 
02:13:16.030 --> 02:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
startup Colorado and in the state of
 
02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
Colorado there are there are competitive
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
Eda and SBA grants that require you that
 
02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
are that are out there specifically the
 
02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
build back better Grant as well as the
 
02:13:26.350 --> 02:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
built to scale Grant these are really
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
good grants that are available for a
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
catalyst to get this stuff going they
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
require matching funds which is 100%
 
02:13:38.109 --> 02:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
required and and needed um in terms of
 
02:13:40.109 --> 02:13:40.119 align:start position:0%
of startup Colorado's model only about
 
02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
20% of our total operating funds came
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
from the state of Colorado and
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
everything else came from from federal
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
and private um individual donors however
 
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
we did not raise a fund to make
 
02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
investments into startups we just did
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
the startup ecosystem development work
 
02:13:59.310 --> 02:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
to get the resources going collaboration
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
with multiple sbdc score a lot of these
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
other accelerator programs co-working
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
spaces to get everyone kind of rowing in
 
02:14:07.709 --> 02:14:07.719 align:start position:0%
the same boat to share that Dill flow
 
02:14:09.629 --> 02:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
Scott mentioned that there's there's
 
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
money here to for in terms of investors
 
02:14:13.629 --> 02:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
they're ready to write a check they just
 
02:14:15.229 --> 02:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
say there's not enough Dill flow there's
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
not enough companies that are ready to
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
meet their investment thesis to receive
 
02:14:21.629 --> 02:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
those funds so they're they're that
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
investment those investment dollars are
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
being sent to other
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
states um I hope that answers okay we
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
got one more question and then we're
 
02:14:32.350 --> 02:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
gonna or two more questions and we'll
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
wrap it up okay
 
02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
re thank you um I just had a question
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
one of the members to sit on the
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
commission is from the Department of
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs and that
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
seems to be the best fit in state
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
government for for the tech Alliance to
 
02:14:53.069 --> 02:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
interface with is there a position in
 
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
the ba that focuses on Startup the
 
02:14:59.310 --> 02:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
startup ecosystem and VC and all that
 
02:15:01.790 --> 02:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
because that seems to be the best place
 
02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:02.549 align:start position:0%
because that seems to be the best place
for

02:15:02.549 --> 02:15:02.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
it it's a good question uh I think
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
broadly there are a there is a position
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
or positions that work you know there
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
are people at ba who work with the tech
 
02:15:11.709 --> 02:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
Alliance and who sit on the government
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
Affairs committee um and but
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
specifically just focused on Startup I
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for the Bea but as
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
far as I know that specific position
 
02:15:22.510 --> 02:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
exist okay
 
02:15:24.639 --> 02:15:27.390 align:start position:0%
exist okay
representative

02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:29.229 align:start position:0%
representative
Burrows

02:15:29.229 --> 02:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
Burrows
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes just I was about to say your first
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
name and I said That's supposed to be
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
rude okay just a quick question you
 
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
talked about um you know private funding
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
have in your experience in other states
 
02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
have have they ever included not just
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
money for the startup but for housing
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
has that ever been done
 
02:15:51.069 --> 02:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
anywhere yes it's I mean there's models
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
all over the country but um from what
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
I've worked with it's been separate
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
entities that have you know economic
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
development is such a large umbrella and
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
Colorado did a really good job about
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
finding folks who who were experts in
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
each of those lanes and collaborating
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
with one another um in my experience it
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
what they weren't convoluted or together
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of a fund that would offer us
 
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
incentives but in New Hampshire I think
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
that would be a good way to go to make
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
sure that you could get the people that
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
you need and just to clarify we're not
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
asking I don't think for Scott um
 
02:16:24.350 --> 02:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but it based on
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
the bill and my conversations we're not
 
02:16:28.669 --> 02:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
asking for the state to run and and
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
house this and fund it 100% we're asking
 
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
for collaboration partnership
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
yeah okay great thank you very much
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you all right having no more cards
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%

02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
a senator Carson you have a card
 
02:16:58.639 --> 02:17:00.589 align:start position:0%
a senator Carson you have a card
or

02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:17:00.599 --> 02:17:02.709 align:start position:0%

great we we're running behind so we'll
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
just get going and do it I always am a
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
little hesitant Mr chairman to say I'll
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
be quick because usually you end up
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
taking an hour so um hopefully I'll be
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%

holding companies um Mr chairman uh I
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
think for the record I should declare
 
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
that I am an officer of the New
 
02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um adoptive um Foster and
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
adoptive parents Association and I've uh
 
02:18:02.669 --> 02:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
worked I've been on that Association for
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
a few years now and we work to uh
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
support foster children um adopt
 
02:18:11.070 --> 02:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
children and children who have been
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
adopted from uh our state system and in
 
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work that we've done we
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
disco I discovered that foster children
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
that are working part-time jobs do not
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
have access to a bank account so um I
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
had a meeting with our state's banking
 
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
Department um over a year ago and we
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
started discussing how can we create um
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
a program that would allow these kids
 
02:18:43.309 --> 02:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
who are working to start banking some
 
02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:46.599 align:start position:0%
money rather than just um depending on
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
somebody else to do them do it for them
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
I think it's in a very important part of
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh Independence and it's something that
 
02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
we'd like to Foster in children um
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
because sooner or later they're going to
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
age out of our system and the sooner
 
02:19:03.549 --> 02:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
that they learn about money and how to
 
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
handle money the better off they'll
 
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
be so this bill does two things it
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
enables a minor over the age of 16 who
 
02:19:16.349 --> 02:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
is in the legal care of HHS um to open a
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
checking or savings account at a bank or
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
credit union and it permits State
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
chartered Banks to have a majority and
 
02:19:27.150 --> 02:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
secondly it permits State Charters Banks
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
to have a majority of directors residing
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or neighboring states
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
the first section of Senate Bill 333
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
Revol resolves challenges faced by
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
Foster Care youths who may have a job
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
and looking for ways to manage their
 
02:19:44.669 --> 02:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
funds but do not have an adult in their
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
lives to co-sign to enable them to open
 
02:19:50.710 --> 02:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
a checking or savings account this
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
impacts a very narrow youth a group of
 
02:19:55.630 --> 02:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
young adults in the state cares and
 
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
enables them to have access to limited
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
Financial Services to help them Achieve
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
Financial stability and improve their
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
financial literacy the second section of
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
the bill assists State chartered Banks
 
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
and appointing qualified directors who
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
are in close-knit communities located
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
along the border and uh Senate Bill 333
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
was developed collaboratively with the
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
banking industry and the Department of
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and banking
 
02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
Department respectively on each section
 
02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill um I would also like to
 
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
publicly thank the New Hampshire banking
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
Department um and the bankers
 
02:20:35.710 --> 02:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
Association for all their hard work they
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
really pulled Bankers together to work
 
02:20:41.230 --> 02:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
on the issue of these kids being able to
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
have their own bank accounts so again
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank them publicly and at
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
this point I am going to conclude my
 
02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will try to answer
 
02:20:51.630 --> 02:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
questions but there are folks here from
 
02:20:54.990 --> 02:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
the banking department and uh from uh
 
02:20:57.630 --> 02:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association to answer
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you Senator
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
and would you take one question yes I
 
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
will I'll try yes thank you I just want
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand the context
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's I never thought of this so children
 
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
that have a parent or Guardian that are
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
16 or older can open bank accounts but
 
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
these kids cannot that is correct
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
because you have to have because they're
 
02:21:24.990 --> 02:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
considered to be minors and they can't
 
02:21:27.469 --> 02:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
they can't sign for it themselves so
 
02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
you've got to have an adult and
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes foster parents um they don't
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
want that
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility um and their parents
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
they're there could be reasons why
 
02:21:40.030 --> 02:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
they're not we don't know why there's a
 
02:21:41.309 --> 02:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
variety of difference why they're not
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
with their legal parents so they're just
 
02:21:47.950 --> 02:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
caught in this limbo and you'd be
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
surprised um we we talk a lot with um
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
older kids that are in foster care they
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
want to learn about money they want to
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
learn how to manage money they want to
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
learn about how do I save for my
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
retirement because if you think about it
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
many of these kids are pulled from their
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
homes and they've lost whatever security
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
that they had and security becomes
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
really a very important issue for these
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
kids and I see this as empowering it's
 
02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
putting them on a path for Independence
 
02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
they can save for college they can do
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
what whatever they want with it but it's
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
their money and they should have access
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
to it quick followup one follow do you
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
have happen to know about how many
 
02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
children are impacted by this um oh and
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
we have well over a thousand children
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
but um according to the last statistic I
 
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
had this would affect fewer than 400 um
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
these are kids that are uh you know 16
 
02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
these are kids that are uh you know 16
or

02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:22:46.750 --> 02:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
older representative
 
02:22:51.790 --> 02:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
spear thank you uh you pied 16 years old
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
to be in this and I remember being as a
 
02:22:57.389 --> 02:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
kid you know we start earning money at
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
around 14 so I'm wondering why you pick
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
16 as opposed to a lower age actually um
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question that was an
 
02:23:08.110 --> 02:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
age that was determined by the
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
bankers um so I I mean they're going to
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
be coming up and I think that would be a
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
good question to ask
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
them all right thank you very much for
 
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:17.920 align:start position:0%

Association we represent 40 member banks
 
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that employ
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
roughly 6,000 employees um we do come
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
before the committee in strong support
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 333 and thank the sponsor
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson for introducing this very
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation um I
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
won't get into my testimony because I
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
think the sponsor did an amazing job
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
highlighting um what this bill does and
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
the importance of it it does enable uh
 
02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
Banks to open accounts for this very
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
small population of Youth uh in foster
 
02:24:17.070 --> 02:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
care that do not have an adult in their
 
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
lives to co-sign on that account which
 
02:24:22.269 --> 02:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
is considered a contract um this would
 
02:24:25.389 --> 02:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
allow them to go in open that account um
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
to um then Access Financial Services
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
mainly bank and savings account and
 
02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
starts them on a path to financial
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
stability um it's extremely important
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
that they have that opportunity the
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
second part of the of the bill would
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
open up and allow our state Charter
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
Banks to um have a majority of their
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
directors board of directors either
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
residing here in Hampshire or in
 
02:24:53.710 --> 02:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
neighboring states like employers it's
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
tough to find um uh employees um it's
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
tough to find directors with specific
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and expertise so opening it
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
up to allowing uh a majority of those
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
directors to be not just New Hampshire
 
02:25:08.230 --> 02:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
residents but residents uh in
 
02:25:09.790 --> 02:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
surrounding states allows them to
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
brought them that net especially when it
 
02:25:15.150 --> 02:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
comes to areas like cyber security um uh
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
right now the current requirement is a
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
majority just in New Hampshire this is
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
is uh especially important for our
 
02:25:26.110 --> 02:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
members along the borders of our state
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
um some of them have border directors
 
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
that live in the other state but spend
 
02:25:34.349 --> 02:25:34.359 align:start position:0%
most of working in New Hampshire owning
 
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
businesses here in New Hampshire so I'll
 
02:25:39.269 --> 02:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude my testimony oh before I
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I would like to
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank both the Department of Health and
 
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
Human Services and the banking
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
department for their collaboration and
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
work on this um as the sponsor said this
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
is this was something that worked with
 
02:25:52.830 --> 02:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
both departments in the fall to come up
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
with the language that is before you
 
02:25:58.030 --> 02:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
today um so I would urge in conclusion
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
would urge the committee uh to support
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 333 and I'm happy to take
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
any questions and and yeah the number 16
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
would you have any opposition to
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
lowering that to 14 that seems to make
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
sense so I'll defer to um Department of
 
02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and our work
 
02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
with uh the department they were the
 
02:26:21.309 --> 02:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
ones that came up with the age 16 and 17
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
um so I will defer to them I believe
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
they are here um and prepared to testify
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions thank you
 
02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:31.550 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions thank you
you're

02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
welcome yes thank you uh one of the
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
things that I'm concerned about is that
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
when you have teenagers who may not have
 
02:26:38.429 --> 02:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
a parent to be able to advise them in
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
this is fees and I was wondering if it
 
02:26:42.349 --> 02:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
would be possible I mean this is just a
 
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
small group of people if we wrote in the
 
02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
bill that they would not be subject to
 
02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
any fees related to the account I mean
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
certainly penalties but fees because
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can have a an account
 
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
drained because of fees mhm and if
 
02:26:57.150 --> 02:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
they're not getting advice from a parent
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
we the bank may want to consider that
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
yep thank you for that thank you for
 
02:27:04.750 --> 02:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
that question and um you know banks have
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
different programs a lot of banks um do
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
have programs they have um what are
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
called Bank on um uh certified programs
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
that do for they do wave um they do wave
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
fees or don't charge fees it's to help
 
02:27:23.269 --> 02:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
Bank the unbanked um to make easier
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
access but I can take that just would be
 
02:27:28.269 --> 02:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
until they reach age of 18 even so that
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
they became
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah great oh representa ton uh just a
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
quick question going uh to the point he
 
02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
just made uh the Savings Bank of Walpole
 
02:27:47.630 --> 02:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
and Mascoma bank had in in my experience
 
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
when my children were miners
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
they had special accounts uh that didn't
 
02:27:57.309 --> 02:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
charge fees would this kind of would
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
this be that kind of account uh I just
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
is it the same Paradigm is that what the
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
thinking here is or if you could just
 
02:28:06.990 --> 02:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
clarify if you know if you could clarify
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
that'd be
 
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
great yeah I mean I I think it depends
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
on you know each bank has different
 
02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
products that they offer um you know we
 
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
would have to go back and talk to our
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
members to see what type you know you
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
know again this is enabling legislation
 
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
it would allow the bank to um if they
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
chose to bank the this population we do
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
have a couple members that have
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
expressed interest unfortunately the
 
02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
banker that uh um testified and the
 
02:28:37.230 --> 02:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
Senate wasn't able to um join us today
 
02:28:38.910 --> 02:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
um he would be able to speak to the
 
02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
services that he provides and the types
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
of accounts that he envisioned I can go
 
02:28:46.510 --> 02:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
back to him and and ask those questions
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
and bring it back to the
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
committee I yeah just get his written
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
statement to the senate or whatever did
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
said of the Senate and have that sent to
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
great represent W CL excuse me thank you
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for being here
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
today um so lines 10 11 and 12 um says
 
02:29:10.469 --> 02:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
the minor shall be responsible for
 
02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
paying all banking related costs
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
associated with checking or savings
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
accounts and shall be liable for any and
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
all penalties should he or she violate a
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
banking agreement I know when my
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
children um were 13 they all um did line
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
field lining and got paid for it and at
 
02:29:35.269 --> 02:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
that point um with a parent signature
 
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
they could have their own account and 35
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
years later they still have the same
 
02:29:45.469 --> 02:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
account so um I for these children it's
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit different because they
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't have parents to advise them um and
 
02:29:54.190 --> 02:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
I think those those fees should be waved
 
02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so that is 10 11 and 12 and would
 
02:29:58.830 --> 02:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
probably need to have an amendment thank
 
02:30:05.389 --> 02:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:05.399 --> 02:30:07.230 align:start position:0%

spirit of what happened yesterday I
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
thought it was the most absolutely
 
02:31:05.309 --> 02:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
fascinating um hearing ever had when
 
02:31:06.990 --> 02:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
asked to being able to tell something in
 
02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
a story
 
02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:10.309 align:start position:0%
a story
format

02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
format
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
so well I I cannot top yesterday that
 
02:31:15.870 --> 02:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
truly by far was my favorite uh public
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
hearing so far today but I do have with
 
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
me attorney Lori Young uh who who's also
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
an attorney like like myself and if you
 
02:31:24.190 --> 02:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
can indulge with a about a two-minute
 
02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
story she can actually give you a quick
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
little story on this one as well we like
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
real life stories I was told of this
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
when I walked in the room so this is uh
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
as attorneys this is what we do so I
 
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
want you to imagine uh we're we're going
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
to stick with the name Johnny I
 
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
understand that was a favorite yesterday
 
02:31:44.429 --> 02:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
name uh so we have little Johnny uh he
 
02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
is in foster care because he is an
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
orphan he is 16 years old that means he
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
has no parent that could sign for any
 
02:31:54.750 --> 02:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
kind of contract like a bank account uh
 
02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
as part of Johnny's team because what
 
02:31:58.510 --> 02:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
you have to imagine is for an individual
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
in foster care for a kid they actually
 
02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
have a whole team behind them they have
 
02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
not only their foster parents they have
 
02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
their assigned social worker they often
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
have other parties at the table we're
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
very fortunate in New Hampshire to have
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
many stakeholders uh that come to the
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
table whether it's educational whether
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
it is therapeutic but you have to
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
imagine uh when you're thinking of this
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
that Johnny has a whole team behind him
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
he's 16 when they talk about his goals
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
Johnny says you know what I really want
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
to go to this basketball camp but it's
 
02:32:28.349 --> 02:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts our normal scholarships
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
don't cover it I can get a little bit of
 
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
this I've looked into it because part of
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
his goals for Independent Living because
 
02:32:35.269 --> 02:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
every child has their own goals is that
 
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
he sets a goal of what he wants to do so
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
he decides he wants to go to basketball
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
camp he wants to be in the NBA I know
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
most of you are NBAs but he wants to be
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
in the NBA so he decides he wants to go
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
to basketball camp that costs around
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
$1,500 they decide said you know what
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
this would be a really good Independent
 
02:32:55.389 --> 02:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
Living goal you can work towards this we
 
02:32:58.510 --> 02:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
agree as a team at the table that going
 
02:33:00.429 --> 02:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
you know going to work and getting a job
 
02:33:02.269 --> 02:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
would be great for you and then having a
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
bank account as it stands right now
 
02:33:06.670 --> 02:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
Johnny if he wanted to save he'd have to
 
02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
keep he had to pay fees to cash a check
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
and then he'd have to just store that
 
02:33:13.469 --> 02:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
cash underneath a mattress and a piggy
 
02:33:15.389 --> 02:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
bank what you want but you think about
 
02:33:18.030 --> 02:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
that that's not only fee driven but it's
 
02:33:21.309 --> 02:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
also um it's just a little ludicrous
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
when we think about how cashless as a
 
02:33:24.190 --> 02:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
society we are that he'd have to just
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
store this so now with this bill he now
 
02:33:29.150 --> 02:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
has the department the team goes to the
 
02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
department and says we agree as a team
 
02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
that this is appropriate for him to have
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
a bank account uh we would like to help
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
him get a job and do that department
 
02:33:38.269 --> 02:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
puts through the bill um in writing that
 
02:33:40.269 --> 02:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
we we consent to that they go to the
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
bank with his foster parents or his
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
social worker whichever one Johnny
 
02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
chooses uh to help him open the bill
 
02:33:47.269 --> 02:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
he's able to get a job we're going to go
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
with Market Basket because I think most
 
02:33:50.309 --> 02:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
of us in New Hampshire started their
 
02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
careers at Market Basket he gets the bow
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
tie he gets to um do his thing and he
 
02:33:57.950 --> 02:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
works and he's able to save that amount
 
02:33:59.230 --> 02:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
what's important though that you notice
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
in the bills I said, 1500 we're not
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
talking 3,000 5,000 that's because
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
Johnny is a foster child and an orphan
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
he is on State Medicaid I want to point
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
that out because we do have asset
 
02:34:10.670 --> 02:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
limitations for that and that's
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
something that we put purposefully into
 
02:34:14.429 --> 02:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
this bill because as much as we want
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
Johnny to have a huge nest egg in the
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
future without other safeguards uh he
 
02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
could not not you know have a bank
 
02:34:23.070 --> 02:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
account for that so that's something
 
02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
that as a department we would have to be
 
02:34:26.670 --> 02:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
Case by case Johnny we know is on
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid he can't have over $2,000 in
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
his bank account so that would be part
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
of our consent we consent to Johnny
 
02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
having a bank account and we will work
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
with him to make sure it's not over
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
$2,000 now the part of the reason the
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
team agreed to this again the team
 
02:34:40.429 --> 02:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
talked about his goal we knew that he
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
was going to spend that he was going to
 
02:34:44.110 --> 02:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
you know raise it and then spend it get
 
02:34:45.950 --> 02:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
it low we're okay with that we agree
 
02:34:48.670 --> 02:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
with that so as a mentality as a team
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's an educational goal independent
 
02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
living and then also we do teach our
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
foster kids as part of our independent
 
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
living goals financial literacy it is
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
very hard to teach that in a vacuum
 
02:34:59.630 --> 02:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
without actually it's very different to
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
do a pretend checkbook than our own
 
02:35:04.670 --> 02:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
checkbook to have a debit card versus a
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
pretend one this would take it a step
 
02:35:08.510 --> 02:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
further in preparing our foster youth
 
02:35:11.309 --> 02:35:11.319 align:start position:0%
for Independence in a controlled way
 
02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
where we consent or and we put in the
 
02:35:16.830 --> 02:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
bill purposefully if the Foster youth
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
the team does not agree with him having
 
02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
a bank account he can go court that we
 
02:35:22.030 --> 02:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
put that in that is an option as well
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the court can decide um so that
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
gives an extra layer of protection and
 
02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
also I think that's also aign of
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
Independence to the youth says I hear
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
you as a team I disagree I'm going to go
 
02:35:34.510 --> 02:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
to court and then you have court
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
protections involved like Court
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
appointing Council in cassa and a g so
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
you just to have just so the committee
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
knows there are layers built in to that
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
as well uh and so now Johnny can go to
 
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
basketball camp we're going to say he
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
made it to the NBA New Hampshire
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
representing and um and and it's all
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
because he was able to have a bank
 
02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
account and go to subn Camp wow
 
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
excellent I have a distinct feeling that
 
02:35:56.520 --> 02:35:59.110 align:start position:0%
excellent I have a distinct feeling that
was

02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
fiction but uh represent Ammon has a
 
02:36:03.870 --> 02:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
question just a question about the
 
02:36:06.750 --> 02:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
$2,000 cap what happens if Johnny earns
 
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
another $10 over 2,000 what happens if
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
he tries to deposit that into the
 
02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
account just curious yeah so we we are
 
02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
with and that's one thing that the
 
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
consent it can be over I think part of
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
the financial literacy is Al the team
 
02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's the Foster or the social
 
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
social worker monitoring the account and
 
02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
making sure and in communication but I
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
think if he were to go over that we
 
02:36:30.389 --> 02:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
would then have to withdraw our consent
 
02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
and have to come up with a spin down
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
plan and that's very common for someone
 
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
benefits that we have to have a spin
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
down plan you have 30 days to spin down
 
02:36:39.070 --> 02:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
so that you don't lose your benefits but
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
that this is but this is again I I
 
02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
highlight that because that's why it's
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
important for the Department to consent
 
02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
not every kid is ready for this just
 
02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
like you talked about your own kids you
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
wait until you knew your k was ready for
 
02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
it are you that you didn't know you had
 
02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
to be on the bank statement yourself
 
02:36:55.150 --> 02:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
getting them that's the same mentality
 
02:36:56.750 --> 02:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
here about consent and then also the
 
02:36:58.710 --> 02:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
court approval is making sure we have
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
the conversation with the kid a
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
16-year-old and I want to answer that
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
question as well about why we chose 16
 
02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
if that's why um that we we know there's
 
02:37:08.630 --> 02:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
that maturity and that expectation and
 
02:37:10.269 --> 02:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
that's clear from the part it was a
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
Department's choice to choose the age of
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
16 internally felt that was an
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate age for this first step of
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
this bill it's for around 400 Foster
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
youth that's a manageable number to see
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
how many are interested in this and then
 
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
go from there this was a good number
 
02:37:29.550 --> 02:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
when talking to the cpsws and internally
 
02:37:31.070 --> 02:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
that this was around the time when we're
 
02:37:33.389 --> 02:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
seeing kids want to work anyway it's
 
02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
also the time of driving for example
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
being able to go um to a job that's a
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
common goal is wanting to buy a car for
 
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
example um and so we felt 16 was a good
 
02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
starting point based on internal
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
discussions with maturity level Foster
 
02:37:48.670 --> 02:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
Youth and interest and those who are
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
currently interested I'm
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
working represent
 
02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
buam thank you for taking my question
 
02:38:01.269 --> 02:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
um what about the foster parents I mean
 
02:38:02.910 --> 02:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
the foster parents could they have
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
access to this
 
02:38:07.469 --> 02:38:07.479 align:start position:0%
account it would be the department that
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
consents to it just like a parent so we
 
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
think they would they would not be able
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
to go into a bank and withdraw money
 
02:38:15.870 --> 02:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
because they would not be on the account
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
the depart you can think of the
 
02:38:19.870 --> 02:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
department is the the parent if you well
 
02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:21.710 align:start position:0%
department is the the parent if you well
okay

02:38:21.710 --> 02:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:23.830 --> 02:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
thanks um I can't believe I'm going to
 
02:38:26.110 --> 02:38:26.120 align:start position:0%
do this but did you see that 60-minute
 
02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
story a couple weeks ago about these
 
02:38:31.630 --> 02:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
foster kids who had no parents and that
 
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
the state was taking uh Medicare
 
02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:36.510 align:start position:0%
the state was taking uh Medicare
Medicare

02:38:36.510 --> 02:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
money it was social was it Social
 
02:38:40.590 --> 02:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
Security or medic it was Social Security
 
02:38:43.469 --> 02:38:43.479 align:start position:0%
money did you see that and repm Hunt um
 
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's actually a bill currently uh in
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
the house on that issue it was sponsored
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
by represent Mary Jane walner it's
 
02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
heading over to the Senate on that very
 
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
issue and we've been provided a sum of
 
02:38:56.910 --> 02:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
money for a consultant to come in to
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
help design what that process would look
 
02:39:01.630 --> 02:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
like here in New Hampshire so that was
 
02:39:03.309 --> 02:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
brilliant but this bill has nothing to
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
do with taking anything this is giving
 
02:39:06.990 --> 02:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
to people and again we chose very
 
02:39:09.070 --> 02:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
carefully the scenario of Johnny because
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
Johnny is going to maintain just like
 
02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
represent post children uh that account
 
02:39:15.309 --> 02:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
until age 34 and then run for the uh
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives and then
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
sometime be serving on well I was I was
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
more worried that that this $2,000 cap
 
02:39:25.950 --> 02:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
that if that money was come available
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know that I get but I guess it
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
18 yeah when someone has Social Security
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
benefits um that rep pay fund would be
 
02:39:38.349 --> 02:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
if someone only has a representative pay
 
02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
and that's that's who takes the money on
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of another person who's
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
incapacitated by age if you will for
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
children uh then when that
 
02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
incapacitation is over so if a child is
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
merely incapacitated because of as soon
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
as they are not incapacitated that money
 
02:39:53.830 --> 02:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
goes to Social Security and then Social
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
Security decides where it goes whether
 
02:39:57.550 --> 02:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
it needs to be a new rep pay because
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
there's a incapacity problem other than
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
age or what's more common is it's age 18
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
they send the the money directly to I
 
02:40:05.790 --> 02:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that that money
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
can go into this account that this
 
02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
account that he have yes that's correct
 
02:40:12.910 --> 02:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
when they're 18 um they the Department's
 
02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
name would come off um and then yes they
 
02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
would have a bank account to receive
 
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
money I feel much better about it then
 
02:40:20.030 --> 02:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
good story
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and and thank you
 
02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
and also uh Senator Carson and you uh
 
02:40:26.670 --> 02:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
represent hun as one of co-sponsor Bill
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
I see there's another question that was
 
02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah representative pelli then
 
02:40:31.230 --> 02:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
representative post again thank you for
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
the story My question is so would the
 
02:40:39.070 --> 02:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
department oversee how the money is
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
being saved and what Johnny wants to do
 
02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
with it is there any guidance on that or
 
02:40:47.630 --> 02:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
he's free to do whatever whatever B bet
 
02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
on DraftKings or do whatever wants with
 
02:40:53.230 --> 02:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
it or or is there some guidance as to
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
what what to do with it so this goes
 
02:40:58.269 --> 02:40:58.279 align:start position:0%
back into the consent and the team
 
02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
mentality that we're relying on and that
 
02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
is something we have thought of um and
 
02:41:04.269 --> 02:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
that's why we wanted to narrow it to age
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
16 to start out and we all wanted to
 
02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
have a narrow number because this would
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
be their bank account uh that is and it
 
02:41:12.990 --> 02:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
would require monitoring by the team and
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
be what we consider an inment
 
02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
independent living goal and it would be
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
something that we'd have to meet on but
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
it would be their bank account and just
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
as a 16-year-old unless mom and dad is
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
right there next to them would be able
 
02:41:25.230 --> 02:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
to spend it yes they would be able to
 
02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:28.349 align:start position:0%
to spend it yes they would be able to
spend

02:41:28.349 --> 02:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
it and representative
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
post yes thank you um my question is
 
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
well my statement is that when I did
 
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
this with my children I was on their
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
bank account I could
 
02:41:48.190 --> 02:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
withdraw and I had that ability to do it
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
although I never did
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
um however with foster children are they
 
02:41:59.830 --> 02:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
still being placed in different families
 
02:42:02.429 --> 02:42:02.439 align:start position:0%
and how would that affect a bank account
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
if a foster family um you know is
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
supporting him with that bank account so
 
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
the Foster family would not be on the
 
02:42:13.309 --> 02:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
bank account be the department and you
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
are correct it you know it does the
 
02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
Foster family there are transitions
 
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
throughout uh whether it's going you
 
02:42:21.269 --> 02:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
know from home to home or are going in
 
02:42:24.349 --> 02:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
and out of different placements I the
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
department would be on the bank account
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
not foster parents now you could have a
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
situation that one Foster family was
 
02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
much more involved for example than a
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
new one but again that's why I go back
 
02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
to each each child has a team behind
 
02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
them um that does not completely change
 
02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
with a new placement and that would be
 
02:42:42.590 --> 02:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
part of their goals that would follow
 
02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
them if I could follow up further
 
02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
question me
 
02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you um so
 
02:42:52.990 --> 02:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
often people who work for the state
 
02:42:55.630 --> 02:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
don't stay there and then they would
 
02:42:58.510 --> 02:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
have to get another person to fill that
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
so would that be um the bank account has
 
02:43:06.070 --> 02:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
to again be
 
02:43:10.269 --> 02:43:10.279 align:start position:0%
done with someone else no it it would um
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
much like I think of the professional
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
fiduciary um professional fiduciaries
 
02:43:17.550 --> 02:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
that we have it's a organizational it's
 
02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
not an independent name
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and and uh chairman hun if I
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
could just follow up on a general you
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
know theme here in response to the
 
02:43:27.389 --> 02:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
several questions that have been asked
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
as Senator Carson mentioned when she
 
02:43:30.990 --> 02:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill we really focus on
 
02:43:32.830 --> 02:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
financial literacy and these kids are
 
02:43:34.590 --> 02:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
caught in a situation where they have no
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
ability no ability to getting a bank
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
account like all children whose brains
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
are developing they're going to make
 
02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
some good choices and bad choices this
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
is that time for them to learn those
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
choices and hopefully you're going to
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
make better choices and worse choices so
 
02:43:47.630 --> 02:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
please consider that when you're
 
02:43:49.389 --> 02:43:49.399 align:start position:0%
actually contemplating on getting the
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
Weeds on the various different scenarios
 
02:43:53.150 --> 02:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
in the bill and we strongly would
 
02:43:54.910 --> 02:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
abdicate not to use that money for
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
DraftKings or anything like
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
that right we call it the Dignity of
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
choice um these kids they're getting
 
02:44:03.269 --> 02:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
into adul who they have the Dignity of
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
making choices uh you know some choices
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
are going to be worse than others but
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
they deserve the chance to make their
 
02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:11.750 align:start position:0%
they deserve the chance to make their
own

02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
choices okay well representative
 
02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
R thank you thanks for taking my
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
question or comment I mean fundamentally
 
02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
this is money that these kids are going
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
to earn so it's really their money and
 
02:44:26.469 --> 02:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
you're helping them by advising them as
 
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
to best choices and best management
 
02:44:32.990 --> 02:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
practices so it seems like yeah they
 
02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
even though they're minors that they
 
02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
really have ownership in this but
 
02:44:40.110 --> 02:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
obviously you know because of issues
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
they have they may need guidance that's
 
02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
right and again that goes back to we're
 
02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
not we're not saying we'll consent for

electronic sharing of a driver's license
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislation is to
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
combat an uptick in scammers posing as
 
02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
land owners and asking a real estate
 
02:46:36.910 --> 02:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
agent to list the property the scam
 
02:46:39.389 --> 02:46:39.399 align:start position:0%
operates in the following manner an
 
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
individual will file uh will claim to be
 
02:46:45.389 --> 02:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
from out of state and looking to sell a
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
property quickly in some cases the
 
02:46:49.950 --> 02:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
scammers have research the history of
 
02:46:52.110 --> 02:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
the property and have a great deal of
 
02:46:54.990 --> 02:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
information which can make the request
 
02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
appear authentic there have been cases
 
02:46:59.550 --> 02:46:59.560 align:start position:0%
where deposits from buyers were placed
 
02:47:02.830 --> 02:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
in escrow before the scam was discovered
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is prevalent in the northern part
 
02:47:07.349 --> 02:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
of the state where vacant land is more
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
um more prevalent and it is something
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
that is happening across the country
 
02:47:15.309 --> 02:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
with greater frequency um I had read an
 
02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
article about um this type of situation
 
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
in Greenwich Connecticut where um a
 
02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
gentleman had inherited not only his
 
02:47:27.230 --> 02:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
house but his family's house but a plot
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
of land that was next to it and he kept
 
02:47:33.389 --> 02:47:33.399 align:start position:0%
that Land open because um he was hoping
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
to get leave it to one of his children
 
02:47:38.750 --> 02:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
and they could build a house there um he
 
02:47:42.349 --> 02:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
was currently living in Florida and uh
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
he got a phone call from a neighbor
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
saying you sold the land and he was like
 
02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
no I didn't um somebody had pretended to
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
be him sold that piece of land to an
 
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
unsuspecting buyer and uh they dug a
 
02:48:02.389 --> 02:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
foundation and they were actually in the
 
02:48:05.469 --> 02:48:05.479 align:start position:0%
process of building a home and this is
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
in Greenwich Connecticut um very very
 
02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
expensive uh place to live so to say the
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
least um he flew up and he confronted
 
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
the people people that were there it got
 
02:48:22.389 --> 02:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
an attorney people were arrested and
 
02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
eventually they discovered that someone
 
02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
had scammed uh these folks um and the
 
02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
people that actually bought the property
 
02:48:33.790 --> 02:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
and paid to have a house put there they
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
were now out of quite a bit of money
 
02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
because they did not purchase legal
 
02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
title to the land so this is the type of
 
02:48:46.309 --> 02:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
situation that this legislation is
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent um under current law
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
real estate lies are prohibited from
 
02:48:56.269 --> 02:48:56.279 align:start position:0%

02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:02.279 align:start position:0%

02:49:02.279 --> 02:49:03.750 align:start position:0%

and can answer any questions and they
 
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
were uh involved in creating the
 
02:50:11.710 --> 02:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
language in advancing the legislation
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
and at this point Mr chairman I will
 
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I will try to
 
02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but the Realtors
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
are here and hopefully they can answer
 
02:50:24.590 --> 02:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
the questions uh we have a real for
 
02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
repres so this is sort of a would you
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
believe less of a question you don't
 
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
have to go to Greenwich Connecticut in
 
02:50:35.469 --> 02:50:35.479 align:start position:0%
chesher County uh which is not
 
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
particularly rural but not particularly
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
developed uh we have had a Spate of
 
02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
these in the last six months and we
 
02:50:48.070 --> 02:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
actually had and your example is good
 
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
but I I want to bring it right home to
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
good old Winchester New Hampshire
 
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
Winchester New Hampshire has a very
 
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
popular not to be confused with
 
02:50:58.190 --> 02:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
Greenwich not to be confused with
 
02:51:00.590 --> 02:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
grenwich but if you buy lakefront
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
property anywhere including
 
02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
Winchester um you can it's expensive so
 
02:51:11.469 --> 02:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
we had a transfer a sale the agent
 
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
listed the property the scenario atat
 
02:51:16.429 --> 02:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
Town seller a morphous name you know
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
like the John be hunt Memorial trust or
 
02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
something like that and somebody called
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
and said yeah that's me and uh they
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
listed the property and the first cash
 
02:51:30.510 --> 02:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
offer that came along they
 
02:51:33.309 --> 02:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
took and interestingly the seller turned
 
02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
down higher offers for more money
 
02:51:36.990 --> 02:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
because they involved time and mortgages
 
02:51:38.510 --> 02:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
and things but that cash offer looked
 
02:51:41.269 --> 02:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
really good to close in 10 days and uh
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
so for
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
$650,000 they closed on a piece of
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
lakefront property in on Forest Lake and
 
02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
Winchester and it was a real shock to
 
02:51:53.550 --> 02:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
the guy who went to build his house to
 
02:51:55.710 --> 02:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
find out that he didn't own it that it
 
02:51:58.269 --> 02:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
had never the real seller had never sold
 
02:52:01.389 --> 02:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
the property these people doing title
 
02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
they didn't do it to get a title they
 
02:52:05.550 --> 02:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
did they the guy forged it was
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
completely forged so the John but but
 
02:52:10.269 --> 02:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
Title Insurance in these both these
 
02:52:11.790 --> 02:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
cases the person didn't buy title
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
insurance they they they they were it
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
was the title insurance would not have
 
02:52:20.190 --> 02:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
covered them from knowing fraud is my
 
02:52:22.349 --> 02:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
understanding so and but that but they
 
02:52:23.950 --> 02:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
don't go away just because you get
 
02:52:27.229 --> 02:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
caught on one street we had the exact
 
02:52:29.630 --> 02:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
same scenario where a builder that my
 
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
company represents said I'm going to
 
02:52:33.790 --> 02:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
throw in a lowball offer and see what
 
02:52:36.190 --> 02:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
they say on some building Lots not more
 
02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
than a mile away and to the astonishment
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
of absolutely everyone in my office the
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
seller so-called agreed to this offer
 
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
and it was the title comp we happen to
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
use the same title company that had been
 
02:52:54.510 --> 02:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
scammed by these people 30 days earlier
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
so this is really prevalent and I would
 
02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
like to make one other observation about
 
02:53:03.550 --> 02:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
the the LI the driver's license issue
 
02:53:05.550 --> 02:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
this is a health and safety issue for
 
02:53:06.750 --> 02:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
Real Estate
 
02:53:09.070 --> 02:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
practitioners there are and you didn't
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
mention that it's not really in the bill
 
02:53:14.070 --> 02:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
but it has been a there are it is not
 
02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
unusual and I'm going to be very sexist
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
here and say for uh
 
02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
women to go and take showings on
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
properties in the evening and at night
 
02:53:27.269 --> 02:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
with people that they don't know and in
 
02:53:30.429 --> 02:53:30.439 align:start position:0%
retrospect you would say why did you do
 
02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
that um but it happens it's a health and
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
safety issue and it is recommended in
 
02:53:40.110 --> 02:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
realtor training that you should verify
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
who you're showing property to but
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
particularly if you know after 45 years
 
02:53:47.790 --> 02:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
nothing surprises you but when you're
 
02:53:50.229 --> 02:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
new and excited and you have your first
 
02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
or second buyer and they say I want to
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
meet you out at the property at
 
02:53:56.429 --> 02:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
6:00 uh at night on a
 
02:53:58.670 --> 02:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and it's out on the back end
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
of nowhere uh and if you don't come back
 
02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
or you don't nobody knows who you met
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's a problem and it has you should
 
02:54:10.349 --> 02:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
be the agents should be able to scan
 
02:54:13.710 --> 02:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
these licenses for that reason as
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
well representative Sullivan that's a
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
would you believe yes
 
02:54:22.429 --> 02:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you um just to clarify
 
02:54:25.590 --> 02:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
so is this some so when when somebody
 
02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
goes to buy a a property now are they
 
02:54:30.389 --> 02:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
checking the identity of of people now
 
02:54:32.429 --> 02:54:32.439 align:start position:0%
or is that like a you choose to check
 
02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
the identity um thank you for the
 
02:54:36.830 --> 02:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm not a real estate person
 
02:54:38.590 --> 02:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
the Realtors are here and they would be
 
02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question if it's
 
02:54:43.510 --> 02:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
required um this is really just an
 
02:54:46.750 --> 02:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to stop people um and
 
02:54:48.510 --> 02:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
establishing really the identity of
 
02:54:49.870 --> 02:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
someone who's selling a piece of
 
02:54:52.510 --> 02:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
property um that they are the actual
 
02:54:55.710 --> 02:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
person um we know it's easy to Fig uh to
 
02:54:58.750 --> 02:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
forge a document but it can be a little
 
02:55:00.750 --> 02:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
more difficult to forge a driver's
 
02:55:03.309 --> 02:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
license and you can check a driver's
 
02:55:05.150 --> 02:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
license as well yeah so yeah I was just
 
02:55:07.590 --> 02:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
looking because it says may and and it
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
sounds like it might be optional you're
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
going to leave it up to them I mean I
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
kind of shy away from Sha because that
 
02:55:17.429 --> 02:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
means every single time and it could be
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're selling you know your brother is
 
02:55:21.309 --> 02:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
selling the property and you know your
 
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
brother so you know who it is so you
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do something like that you
 
02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require it so you just want to
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
give some discretion representative gry
 
02:55:32.030 --> 02:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
has a question yeah one of the concerns
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
I have on here and it talked about in in
 
02:55:35.349 --> 02:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
line 25 it talk you should not retain
 
02:55:36.870 --> 02:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
the scan license for a period of longer
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
than the closing date and and if I would
 
02:55:41.790 --> 02:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
think if it was fraud you'd probably
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to have that license longer than
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
the closing date because once the
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
license the scan is gone you can't
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
figure out who that person is if they
 
02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
did have a fake license or a fake ID
 
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
would putting something in here like
 
02:55:57.190 --> 02:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
maybe 6 months beyond the closing or a
 
02:55:59.229 --> 02:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
year beyond the closing in case we found
 
02:56:01.590 --> 02:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
out that it was fraudulently purchased
 
02:56:04.110 --> 02:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
that at least we have a photo of that
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
person um thank you for that question um
 
02:56:10.630 --> 02:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting point when this
 
02:56:14.110 --> 02:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
was crafted I I know my concerns were
 
02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
about privacy and our and protecting the
 
02:56:19.630 --> 02:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
driver driver's license we use our
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license for so many things
 
02:56:25.550 --> 02:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
today um and we do have a constitutional
 
02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment concerning privacy and if you
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
put in a section for them to hold it
 
02:56:32.309 --> 02:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
then you're going to have to put in what
 
02:56:34.269 --> 02:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
are their criteria how are they going to
 
02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
hold it how is that going to be uh
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
maintained the security around it and
 
02:56:41.910 --> 02:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
then you're going to have to have
 
02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
legislation well if there's a breach of
 
02:56:47.349 --> 02:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
security what are you going to do this
 
02:56:50.830 --> 02:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
is I I it could at some point if they
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
decide that's what they want to do but
 
02:56:55.630 --> 02:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
for me this was a first step in giving
 
02:56:57.630 --> 02:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
them a tool and and the way that I
 
02:57:00.349 --> 02:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
phrase it it's a tool in the toolbox for
 
02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
realtors um so I I understand your
 
02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
concerns representative um I'm I was
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
just concerned about privacy
 
02:57:12.190 --> 02:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
issues so I take the opposite point of
 
02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
view um in the vacation rental business
 
02:57:18.590 --> 02:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
this is a huge problem people take take
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
the real estate listing of the house M
 
02:57:24.349 --> 02:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
and put it up on
 
02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
Airbnb and people start you know sending
 
02:57:28.870 --> 02:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
monies and and both try to book and then
 
02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
and uh you know with that through that
 
02:57:33.229 --> 02:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
to that property when it turns out they
 
02:57:37.710 --> 02:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
didn't really own it um and both my I
 
02:57:40.550 --> 02:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
use verbo but you knowb they all now
 
02:57:42.670 --> 02:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
promised well that if you get scam like
 
02:57:44.349 --> 02:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
that they'll find you another place you
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
know they they'll try to cover it but it
 
02:57:48.750 --> 02:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
is a huge issue so the reason why I say
 
02:57:51.150 --> 02:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
I take a different point of view is that
 
02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
um I I myself uh we we were always
 
02:57:56.309 --> 02:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
worried about whether we had an age
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
requirement in the vacation and you know
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're 30 years old so we ask you to
 
02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
prove it by sending you a sending us a
 
02:58:04.990 --> 02:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
copy of your driver's
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
license and yes I still have all those
 
02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
driver's license attached to the form
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
because I staple it to the to the thing
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
and there it is so I am absolutely aware
 
02:58:17.229 --> 02:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
that I am breaking this statute and but
 
02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
I would say is is that what what we need
 
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
to review and I and I would not
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily delay this issue but I I've
 
02:58:29.469 --> 02:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
always being aware of this problem is
 
02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
that the customer has a right to say no
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to give you my driver's
 
02:58:38.990 --> 02:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
license in that case then we just don't
 
02:58:39.870 --> 02:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
do the
 
02:58:42.590 --> 02:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
deal but that if the customer is willing
 
02:58:45.429 --> 02:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
to give the driver's license they have
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
to know that that there is a potential
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
that that license that copy is not going
 
02:58:51.870 --> 02:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
to get
 
02:58:54.349 --> 02:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
destroyed they have to know
 
02:58:58.349 --> 02:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
that having said that I agree with what
 
02:59:00.269 --> 02:59:00.279 align:start position:0%
I was about to say the same thing you
 
02:59:01.550 --> 02:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
know representative grassy is talking
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
about which is when do you at what point
 
02:59:06.110 --> 02:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
do you destroy that credit card in my
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
case it would be when the renter shows
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
up and clearly they're over 30 or we
 
02:59:11.469 --> 02:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
profile them and see that they're over
 
02:59:13.790 --> 02:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
30 then we're not worried about it but
 
02:59:16.550 --> 02:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time I've heard you know of
 
02:59:19.469 --> 02:59:19.479 align:start position:0%
all these scams that yeah I think that
 
02:59:24.110 --> 02:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
to to hold the person who requested it
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
and was given it by the
 
02:59:29.550 --> 02:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
customer and to hold them responsible to
 
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
say that they need to you know turn it
 
02:59:33.790 --> 02:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
over and they need to burn it and no
 
02:59:35.630 --> 02:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
come on I'm going to hold on to it as
 
02:59:38.389 --> 02:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
long as I'm I can be worried that on my
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
exposure to that person not being who
 
02:59:42.550 --> 02:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
they were so there is something that I
 
02:59:45.030 --> 02:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
would think we might want to look at and
 
02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
and in terms of you know that this this
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
issue isn't just this I mean I guess
 
02:59:52.910 --> 02:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
technically U vacation rentals is a real
 
02:59:56.030 --> 02:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
estate real estate issue um but you know
 
02:59:58.070 --> 02:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's probably a lot of cases
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
I mean I had one was the classic one was
 
03:00:03.630 --> 03:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
every time I um at my soab dealer in
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
motor they when I G they gave me a loner
 
03:00:08.950 --> 03:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
they took a copy of my driver's license
 
03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
and they stuck it in their folder yeah
 
03:00:12.990 --> 03:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
okay now did you say did I ever ask for
 
03:00:15.870 --> 03:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
it back no because the next time I come
 
03:00:17.150 --> 03:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
they don't have to make another copy
 
03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
they've already got it
 
03:00:21.429 --> 03:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
but clearly that violated the law Mr
 
03:00:25.229 --> 03:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I think that that a number
 
03:00:27.190 --> 03:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
of points have been raised about this
 
03:00:28.750 --> 03:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to leave it up to the
 
03:00:30.590 --> 03:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
collective wisdom of this committee if
 
03:00:33.190 --> 03:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
you want them to be able to hold it
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine I'm I'm not going to
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
complain about it I would not uh you
 
03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
know hold this up I I do think it's
 
03:00:42.670 --> 03:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
extremely important um we're dealing as
 
03:00:44.429 --> 03:00:44.439 align:start position:0%
the representative said with a lot of
 
03:00:46.190 --> 03:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
these things that are happening that
 
03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
plus people who are squ
 
03:00:53.710 --> 03:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
right in properties so um okay you want
 
03:00:54.950 --> 03:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
have a last
 
03:00:57.309 --> 03:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
question just on the issue of what's
 
03:00:59.429 --> 03:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
called non-public information
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
NPI um most of I know all of the lenders
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
if you deal with lender owned properties
 
03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
and those kinds of things
 
03:01:10.429 --> 03:01:10.439 align:start position:0%
foreclosures There are rules on handling
 
03:01:12.309 --> 03:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
and I think the association may actually
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
have rules on it and Professional
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
Standards regarding non-public
 
03:01:18.670 --> 03:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
information so
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
um you
 
03:01:23.870 --> 03:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
know my only point is there is on on the
 
03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
on the professional side of it if you
 
03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
belong to the realtor Association which
 
03:01:34.990 --> 03:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
all lenses do not um nor do they have to
 
03:01:38.830 --> 03:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh but there are there are again there
 
03:01:40.429 --> 03:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
are there's professional training and
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
constraints on what are going to do with
 
03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:43.429 align:start position:0%
constraints on what are going to do with
that

03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:47.870 --> 03:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
nonpublic information and um obviously
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
people are going to screw up no matter
 
03:01:52.229 --> 03:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
what you do but I would say I agree with
 
03:01:54.830 --> 03:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
the six months and I wouldn't want to
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
hold this up over it either right okay
 
03:01:59.670 --> 03:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
03:02:02.269 --> 03:02:02.279 align:start position:0%

educator in the real estate space as
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
well um I think you all have done a
 
03:02:39.070 --> 03:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful job having this conversation
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
um before my testimony and it
 
03:02:43.750 --> 03:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
encompassed a lot of what I was going to
 
03:02:47.349 --> 03:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
say um how this came about was one of
 
03:02:47.359 --> 03:02:48.389 align:start position:0%
say um how this came about was one of
our

03:02:48.389 --> 03:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:02:51.429 --> 03:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
um fellow lies our colleagues um had a
 
03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
conversation someone called and said
 
03:02:56.790 --> 03:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
that they were the son of a former
 
03:02:58.870 --> 03:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
client they were saying all the right
 
03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
things Spidey senses went up they were
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
like I'm not really sure I should
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably ask for some identification
 
03:03:08.990 --> 03:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
just to make sure this leny spoke with
 
03:03:10.630 --> 03:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
um a friend of theirs who happened to be
 
03:03:12.990 --> 03:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
a member of the State Police they said
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
Hold up you can't ask for and retain
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
this driver's license information
 
03:03:20.110 --> 03:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
so that's where all of this kind of came
 
03:03:22.830 --> 03:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
about in addition to just the safety
 
03:03:24.670 --> 03:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
aspect of it as well we would really
 
03:03:27.389 --> 03:03:27.399 align:start position:0%
like for this to be in place um and to
 
03:03:30.389 --> 03:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
add some more kind of Hometown stories
 
03:03:32.590 --> 03:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
there's one particular parcel in The
 
03:03:35.229 --> 03:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region that has been targeted
 
03:03:37.670 --> 03:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
multiple times by scammers um and it's
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
actually owned by a a fraud attorney
 
03:03:44.030 --> 03:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
which is interesting perfect so um yeah
 
03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
so everybody knows that this is kind of
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
the place but a number of Agents have
 
03:03:49.590 --> 03:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
kind of gone through the motions of
 
03:03:52.510 --> 03:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
getting this almost listed or actually
 
03:03:55.150 --> 03:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
listed before they realize that this was
 
03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
the case um and when you get further
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
down the you know the transaction
 
03:04:03.429 --> 03:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
process from contract to close there are
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
some steps that can be taken tidal is
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
doing a really good job now knowing that
 
03:04:10.269 --> 03:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
these scams are going on to kind of make
 
03:04:11.950 --> 03:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
sure that they're not getting through
 
03:04:14.830 --> 03:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
closing um and identifying these parties
 
03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
lenders same way but that's also on just
 
03:04:19.389 --> 03:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
the Buy side not on the cell side which
 
03:04:22.349 --> 03:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
is where the scammers are um so we kind
 
03:04:23.710 --> 03:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
of want to head it off right at the
 
03:04:26.990 --> 03:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
beginning if we could so yeah happy to

04:26:55.269 --> 04:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's yeah Badger company okay uh I don't
 
04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
see okay we'll open up the public
 
04:27:01.309 --> 04:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill
 
04:27:04.750 --> 04:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
97 and here from the prime sponsor who's
 
04:27:07.870 --> 04:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
already in place and ready to go thank
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh I'm Senator David
 
04:27:11.349 --> 04:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
Waters from District Ford to introduce
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 97 relative to the use of
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
animals and product testing and it may
 
04:27:18.030 --> 04:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
seem like deja vu all over again Mr
 
04:27:20.349 --> 04:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and or maybe a long winding
 
04:27:22.510 --> 04:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
road but I think this time we really gut
 
04:27:25.030 --> 04:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
it on this bill through a lot of
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
iterations but um but to get to get to
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
the bill um this bill uh is puts some
 
04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
guard rails of Regulation around animal
 
04:27:39.950 --> 04:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
in product testing and um what's why we
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
need to do this is because we want want
 
04:27:44.830 --> 04:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that New Hampshire has
 
04:27:48.990 --> 04:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate Statute in place should
 
04:27:51.389 --> 04:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
there be animal testing that might go
 
04:27:53.550 --> 04:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
beyond the bounds of what uh is
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate under Federal legislation
 
04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
and secondly it's important to do
 
04:27:59.469 --> 04:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
because while there is some Federal
 
04:28:01.710 --> 04:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
Regulation on it they do not enforce
 
04:28:03.910 --> 04:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
federal statute within States so in a
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
lot of Regulation we also have um you
 
04:28:10.109 --> 04:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
know kind of parallel concomitant within
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
the state I think that this bill comes
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
to you in a spirit of what is uh
 
04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
practical and what uh is appropriate for
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
animal protection um you know I think
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
for those have been around for a while
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
we look back to the commitment for
 
04:28:27.630 --> 04:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
animals in this state I I think Bob
 
04:28:29.309 --> 04:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
Smith Senator Bob Smith when he was a
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative and a senator um he
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
carried an animal protections as one of
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
his main issues uh and then after you
 
04:28:40.349 --> 04:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
know Jud Greg as as well and um you know
 
04:28:42.149 --> 04:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
and particularly with the dogs and
 
04:28:44.510 --> 04:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
domestic pets of Senator Bradley so
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's just such a tradition here
 
04:28:47.790 --> 04:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have the appropriate
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
Protections in place so um to look at
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
page two is where the heart of the uh
 
04:28:57.550 --> 04:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
bill is um and it says
 
04:29:00.750 --> 04:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh don't use traditional animal test if
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
the alternative is
 
04:29:06.269 --> 04:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
available or if it
 
04:29:10.590 --> 04:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
meets um you know if if it can meet the
 
04:29:13.950 --> 04:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
provisions of the exceptions that are um
 
04:29:18.830 --> 04:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
provided and uh so what this will let us
 
04:29:20.910 --> 04:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
do is to say that you know here are the
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
criteria but importantly listing on page
 
04:29:25.309 --> 04:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
one the
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
exceptions um and just to turn to those
 
04:29:29.309 --> 04:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
then you have your definition of
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
alternative test methods and this is not
 
04:29:33.149 --> 04:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
something that we invented this is what
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
other states uh have and it outlines um
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know where alternative methods are
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
defined and then uh noting starting
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
online um 18 the exceptions that
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes a biomedical research uh if
 
04:29:52.990 --> 04:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
there is not an appropriate alternative
 
04:29:55.389 --> 04:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
then this that's what you you can
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
conduct the research uh you have your
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
definition of contract testing um uh
 
04:30:02.990 --> 04:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
facility manufacturing traditional
 
04:30:05.910 --> 04:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
animal test method um in particular in
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
the biomedical research um apparently I
 
04:30:11.750 --> 04:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
had thought we had really made sure that
 
04:30:11.760 --> 04:30:12.830 align:start position:0%
had thought we had really made sure that
the

04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
universities uh and colleges research
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
was covered by the language here I think
 
04:30:19.630 --> 04:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
they want to tweak this to make sure
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
that the kind of testing they do um
 
04:30:25.149 --> 04:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
would uh be appropriately recognized in
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
in the bill and the protection for
 
04:30:28.469 --> 04:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
testing that simply must be done for
 
04:30:30.389 --> 04:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
life- saving drugs and other other
 
04:30:31.630 --> 04:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
reasons so I think you're going to hear
 
04:30:33.229 --> 04:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
about a possible little Amendment there
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
and I think that that makes some
 
04:30:38.710 --> 04:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
sense um what really uh you know as you
 
04:30:39.790 --> 04:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
know there's been a lot of history on
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
this this bill a couple times and it was
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
retained in the Senate and what really
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
um kind of broke the Log Jam uh was on
 
04:30:51.630 --> 04:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
page two that last paragraph we went
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
around and around on whether there would
 
04:30:56.429 --> 04:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
be the attorney general or some other
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
agency would have enforcement or fines
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
or penalties and so on and then would we
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
have to create a recordkeeping registry
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
where the state would be responsible for
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
collecting the records of any lab or any
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or so on and what we came
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
up with with great advice from the
 
04:31:19.870 --> 04:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office uh and others
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
in HHS
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
too have a record keeping requirement
 
04:31:28.349 --> 04:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
but it have it be on on the folks who
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
may be doing the testing to post whether
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
or not they're doing it and it would
 
04:31:35.429 --> 04:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
just be on their website or otherwise
 
04:31:38.950 --> 04:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
and to alert the public that that uh by
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
that means and I that that's really what
 
04:31:43.149 --> 04:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
made this bill um possible that that
 
04:31:45.389 --> 04:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
seemed a very reasonable approach uh to
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
take as to um how we had some assurance
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
that the the people would know if such
 
04:31:53.630 --> 04:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
testing was taking place and that these
 
04:31:55.269 --> 04:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
alternative test methods and traditional
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
test methods um criteria had been
 
04:31:59.469 --> 04:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
followed so I know we're going to have
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
um Kurt Amberg here and some uh folks
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
representing um Dartmouth who can talk
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
more about it but I you know I would be
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
GL to take a couple questions but I
 
04:32:10.389 --> 04:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
probably prefer to turn it over too but
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Ammon
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony I just have a question on
 
04:32:18.670 --> 04:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
uh it just popped into my head so
 
04:32:18.680 --> 04:32:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh it just popped into my head so
forgive

04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
forgive
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
me uh does this apply to animal testing
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
in the womb so if if the animal let say
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's an embryo could could a
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer still do testing on an
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
embryo would that fall under this the
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
statute you know I'm going to have to
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the expt I I can't
 
04:32:39.070 --> 04:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
imagine I think so I can't imagine but I
 
04:32:44.109 --> 04:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:47.710 --> 04:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor yes go ahead you're tough Mr
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
chairman right my question is how many
 
04:32:58.269 --> 04:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
companies are um doing animal testing do
 
04:33:01.389 --> 04:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
you know is there a record of who's
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
who's for your question um as best did I
 
04:33:06.590 --> 04:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
know and again Kurt will address this
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
there is no one current no no company
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturers currently doing it we
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
heard from folks like berts bees who
 
04:33:16.029 --> 04:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
have made a corporate commission to uh
 
04:33:18.070 --> 04:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
commitment to not use that and they
 
04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
advertise that um but I think that the
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh inverse the of this is that um we
 
04:33:27.310 --> 04:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
don't want New Hampshire to become a
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
target for a company that might wish to
 
04:33:31.670 --> 04:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
start that testing because we don't have
 
04:33:34.429 --> 04:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
the appropriate statutes in place um
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
certainly there is appr appropriate
 
04:33:38.230 --> 04:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
testing that may be under undertaken in
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
the biomedic research and that's
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
important and that's why the the federal
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
statute the exemptions are there that
 
04:33:46.830 --> 04:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
you know for for health and you know
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be that you really there
 
04:33:51.230 --> 04:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
is no alternative then yes um those are
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
permitted and that but as far as the a
 
04:33:57.150 --> 04:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or a Cosmetic Company um at
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
this point uh there is there there is
 
04:33:59.760 --> 04:34:02.709 align:start position:0%
this point uh there is there there is
none

04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.629 --> 04:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
currently representative pus thank you
 
04:34:08.109 --> 04:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank Senator Waters uh I
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
have a question you mentioned uh
 
04:34:15.109 --> 04:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
the who would be doing the testing I
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
noticed uh line 18 to 27 says we know
 
04:34:22.109 --> 04:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
what the the different types of testing
 
04:34:25.869 --> 04:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
are my question is does it really matter
 
04:34:28.990 --> 04:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
who is doing it by listing who we would
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
either include or exclude by accident
 
04:34:34.000 --> 04:34:35.789 align:start position:0%
either include or exclude by accident
someone

04:34:35.789 --> 04:34:35.799 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:34:39.349 --> 04:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question um I I think
 
04:34:42.750 --> 04:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
that what we try what has tried to be
 
04:34:46.189 --> 04:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
done in lines 18 through 29 here is to
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
provide that kind of coverage so you got
 
04:34:48.160 --> 04:34:49.109 align:start position:0%
provide that kind of coverage so you got
your

04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:34:51.429 --> 04:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
biomedical uh you got contract testing
 
04:34:53.709 --> 04:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
facilities you got manufacturers I
 
04:34:58.709 --> 04:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned cosmetic folks um and uh so
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
and then I think the traditional animal
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
test method kind of kind of sets the
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
criteria about what you would evalue who
 
04:35:06.670 --> 04:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
who might be doing it so I I think this
 
04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
is pretty comprehensive and again it is
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
kind of modeled on what the federal
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
agree thank you was that I'm sorry
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else I guess I guess I I'll play
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
a devil's advocate here go ahead
 
04:35:30.750 --> 04:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
so as I read this recordkeeping thing y
 
04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
so the recordkeeping thing is that we're
 
04:35:35.709 --> 04:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
going to require anybody who
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
who who does do it right I guess we're
 
04:35:41.629 --> 04:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
talk of Dartmouth Hitchcock if they do
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
do it they have to put on their web page
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
that they're doing this
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
testing thank you for the question yeah
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
so um after 2026 so they have some time
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh and uh note that there is an
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
exclusion here um for biomedical
 
04:36:03.150 --> 04:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
research so every experiment conducted
 
04:36:05.070 --> 04:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
at you know UNH Dartmouth wouldn't have
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
to be listed on the website because they
 
04:36:09.390 --> 04:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
would be covered under the federal and
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
other requirements on the biomedical
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
definition here but if you're a
 
04:36:16.109 --> 04:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturer a contract testing facility
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
if you begin to do this then you would
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
put on your website we are conducting
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
such and such
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
tests right so but it's it's still
 
04:36:26.240 --> 04:36:27.429 align:start position:0%
tests right so but it's it's still
limited

04:36:27.429 --> 04:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
limited
 
04:36:31.349 --> 04:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
to uh some requirements of what the
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
processing being so so if I may Mr
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
chairman so you see in lines 17 18
 
04:36:40.029 --> 04:36:40.039 align:start position:0%
number number and species of animals he
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
was on page two number of species of an
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
used type of number of alternative test
 
04:36:46.269 --> 04:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
methods used the number of waivers used
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the of the testing
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
for all methods so it's just it's a very
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
light touch really to that somebody can
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
check right so now I'm going to play
 
04:36:56.510 --> 04:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
Devil's Advocate so why do we have to
 
04:36:56.520 --> 04:36:58.551 align:start position:0%
Devil's Advocate so why do we have to
say

04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh um no manufacturer contractor shall
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
use a traditional animal test meth which
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
is appropriate alternative me so as long
 
04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
as we we're not going to ban it we're
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
just going to say is if you are doing
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
it you you you as long as you put it on
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
your web page and tell everybody because
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
this is kind this public disclosure is I
 
04:37:25.150 --> 04:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
assume intended to be sort of a public
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
embarrassment you know that that that
 
04:37:28.990 --> 04:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
you're you you you might think it's
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
awkward to put on your web page that the
 
04:37:34.390 --> 04:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
fact that you're testing animals thanks
 
04:37:36.750 --> 04:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
for the question yeah I go ahead how you
 
04:37:38.029 --> 04:37:38.039 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm saying I said so
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
isn't that is that penalty enough for
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
someone who's for given that we have
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
nobody's doing this
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
now and somebody wants to come to New
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and start up a biotech
 
04:37:51.310 --> 04:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
business or whatever and they you know
 
04:37:55.510 --> 04:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to need to test animals
 
04:37:57.150 --> 04:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we just be happy that we've
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
got this requirement that they have to
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
put it on their web page and and
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
publicly announce to everybody in the
 
04:38:06.150 --> 04:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
world that that's what they're doing
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question I think that to
 
04:38:10.590 --> 04:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
me it's not embar about public
 
04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
embarrassment or anything I think what
 
04:38:15.230 --> 04:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
it is is for us to um know that they
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
have checked the boxes that that if
 
04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
there is no alternative method available
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
they're using the
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
traditional that's what that's what it
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
gets at we have all the exception for
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
alternative and they can just say we're
 
04:38:30.029 --> 04:38:30.039 align:start position:0%
doing we're using X alternative method
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
on these animals for these purposes if
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
the alternative doesn't exist or they
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
have an exemption because of the you
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
know the things that are listed then
 
04:38:40.750 --> 04:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
they'll say we're using traditional test
 
04:38:43.629 --> 04:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
method these anal under such and such um
 
04:38:48.029 --> 04:38:48.039 align:start position:0%
protocol and so uh it it is a light
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
touch but I think it's important because
 
04:38:52.269 --> 04:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
it says to the folks coming in that um
 
04:38:54.269 --> 04:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
you know we are we got an eye on this
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know that the state of New Hampshire
 
04:38:57.510 --> 04:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
is interested in protecting Animal
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
Welfare I mean that is a very deep
 
04:39:03.070 --> 04:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
tradition for us and this is um just to
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
say you know we're we're going to take
 
04:39:07.390 --> 04:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
some appropriate caution to make sure
 
04:39:09.310 --> 04:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
that uh the statute's being followed got
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's I think another thanks for the
 
04:39:17.310 --> 04:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
question that I think is another reason
 
04:39:19.230 --> 04:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
why the bill worked in the Senate
 
04:39:23.709 --> 04:39:23.719 align:start position:0%
because it is silent on that because we
 
04:39:25.590 --> 04:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
did not want to
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
involve that HHS or doj would have to
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
visit every website of every person in
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
the state looking for it it is public
 
04:39:38.110 --> 04:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
information if a member of the
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
public such as you know I can imagine
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
human main society or sbca if they if
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about this and they
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
can look around the websites and uh and
 
04:39:52.270 --> 04:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
and see who's doing what and um that I
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
think is if and if they think that they
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
that there is a violation I suppose it
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
could be called to the attention or I
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
would say of you know they could call it
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the attention of of the state but I
 
04:40:06.350 --> 04:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
didn't want the state to be involved in
 
04:40:08.430 --> 04:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance of everybody who's in
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
business in the state and uh I think we
 
04:40:13.788 --> 04:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
often you know have have things that are
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
posted by by companies and um this see
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me be a a light touch and
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to put the
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the manufacturers to
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
let the public
 
04:40:30.750 --> 04:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
know no it's it's it's untenable I mean
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
you I've never had a bill in which we
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
aren't going to identify who the
 
04:40:33.638 --> 04:40:36.150 align:start position:0%
aren't going to identify who the
regulator

04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
regulator
 
04:40:38.470 --> 04:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
is you got to you got to know who's
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
04:41:05.110 --> 04:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%

this bill anymore uh the original Bill
 
04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
had compliance through the Attorney
 
04:42:37.868 --> 04:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
General's office which was deemed much
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
too expensive and honorous by many of

to our Chairman's very valid point
 
04:44:18.868 --> 04:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
should you or someone discover that you
 
04:44:21.310 --> 04:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
know once this Bill gets passed that yes
 
04:44:24.150 --> 04:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
there is a company out there that is
 
04:44:27.310 --> 04:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
going against this who would you bring
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
it to so do you know in other states who
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
the regulator is my my organization
 
04:44:38.350 --> 04:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
alone has resources legal technical Etc
 
04:44:40.230 --> 04:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
that could bring we could bring to bear
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that company was out
 
04:44:46.590 --> 04:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
of business whether it was through
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
legal protest whatever it may be you
 
04:44:53.708 --> 04:44:53.718 align:start position:0%
know we we will this bill is important
 
04:44:56.550 --> 04:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
the to stop the cruel testing
 
04:44:59.788 --> 04:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary cruel testing on animals is
 
04:45:02.708 --> 04:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
very important so what what my
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
organization has decided to do is you
 
04:45:08.470 --> 04:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
know we will if if the state of New
 
04:45:10.310 --> 04:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't have the resources to
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
protect these animals we'll take that on
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
all we're asking is that you make sure
 
04:45:18.990 --> 04:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
that we know what's going on and that
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
anyone who might be doing this to
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
animals has to tell us and if they're if
 
04:45:26.510 --> 04:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're testing products and not testing
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
on animals fine um and and you know if
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
there is a small amendment to this bill
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
because you know we have been very clear
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
biomed research is not part of this bill
 
04:45:42.750 --> 04:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
so if there is need to be a provision a
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
a slight language change to protect a
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
facility at
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth fine as long as that language
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
is very clear that it is only for biomed
 
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
research purposes we would be we would
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
be okay with that depending on what the
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
language actually
 
04:46:01.080 --> 04:46:02.628 align:start position:0%
language actually
is

04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair and I love

04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
couple of recent news stories one the
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
federal government was paying for
 
04:46:22.990 --> 04:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
research for beagles thousands and
 
04:46:25.230 --> 04:46:25.240 align:start position:0%

04:46:29.070 --> 04:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
them down and inflicting Sandfly larvae
 
04:46:31.110 --> 04:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
on the dogs on their heads until it
 
04:46:33.708 --> 04:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
drove the dogs insane and they were
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
released from the lab and went up for
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%

adopting one dog oh that's really good I
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
know those dogs yeah that's very Co that
 
04:46:51.628 --> 04:46:51.638 align:start position:0%
pulled up my heart those dogs I do know
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
those dogs actually that's really good
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
um but I want to follow up because of it
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
could be a potential loophole um there
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
there are also recent stories about uh
 
04:47:02.430 --> 04:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
the there's new technology where they
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
can grow animals in like a plastic bag
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
they can grow sheep in a plastic bag
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
right and well they could be a animal so
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
as a potential loophole for this um bill
 
04:47:17.548 --> 04:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
that you're proposing does it Outlaw
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
testing on fetal animals on animals that
 
04:47:23.628 --> 04:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
have not yet been born and uh just
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.788 --> 04:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
question so the way I read this bill any
 
04:47:30.798 --> 04:47:32.628 align:start position:0%
question so the way I read this bill any
animal

04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
animal
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
any like any part of you would be part
 
04:47:38.548 --> 04:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
of you would be contained as a part of
 
04:47:41.070 --> 04:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
your person that if you're testing on
 
04:47:41.080 --> 04:47:41.910 align:start position:0%
your person that if you're testing on
the

04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
animal you're testing on the animal it's
 
04:47:45.200 --> 04:47:46.190 align:start position:0%
animal you're testing on the animal it's
pretty

04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%

committee support Senate Bill 97 to
 
04:49:49.990 --> 04:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit product testing on animals when
 
04:49:53.470 --> 04:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
an alternative test method can be used
 
04:49:55.548 --> 04:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
this bill is another step forward in the
 
04:49:58.270 --> 04:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
campaign to end the infliction of pain
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
and suffering on animals under the guise
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
of human protection many tests performed
 
04:50:05.788 --> 04:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
on animals continue simply to comply
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
with regulations rather than from any
 
04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
scientific value animals are burned
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
blinded scalded poisoned mutilated
 
04:50:17.788 --> 04:50:17.798 align:start position:0%
starved and have sub substances forced
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
down their throat through tubes so that
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
the products we use every day can be
 
04:50:22.798 --> 04:50:23.990 align:start position:0%
the products we use every day can be
called

04:50:23.990 --> 04:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:50:26.350 --> 04:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
safe Senate Bill
 
04:50:29.110 --> 04:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
97 will prevent any such unnecessary
 
04:50:32.030 --> 04:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
tasks from taking place in New Hampshire
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
as you consider this bill note that
 
04:50:36.868 --> 04:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
today April 2 24th happens to be world
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
day for laboratory animals I know isn't
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
that a coincidence
 
04:50:47.270 --> 04:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
huh yeah since it's its Inception in
 
04:50:50.830 --> 04:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
1979 World Daya lab animals has spurred
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
the global effort to Halt animal
 
04:50:55.150 --> 04:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
suffering and substitute these
 
04:50:56.948 --> 04:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
experiments with sophisticated
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
non-animal methods these changes cannot
 
04:51:02.350 --> 04:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
come fast enough for the estimated
 
04:51:06.190 --> 04:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
825,000 animals experimented on in the
 
04:51:08.548 --> 04:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
United States every year this includes
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
roughly 72,000 monkeys
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
42 45,000 dogs and 13,000
 
04:51:20.110 --> 04:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
cats if you add Birds mice rats and
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
fish species considered so important
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
unimportant that resourcers don't even
 
04:51:27.310 --> 04:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
have to report how many they use the
 
04:51:29.110 --> 04:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
number of animals used in experiments
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
each year is 10 in the tens of
 
04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
millions in closing we hope that the
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
committee will support sb97 and in honor
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
of world day for lab animals we she Joan
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
would like to ask you to pledge to
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
purchase only crueltyfree cosmetics and
 
04:51:46.638 --> 04:51:48.070 align:start position:0%
purchase only crueltyfree cosmetics and
household

04:51:48.070 --> 04:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
household
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
products and um thank you for your
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
consideration and I would just like to
 
04:51:56.350 --> 04:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
say a little bit um I've been around a
 
04:51:58.830 --> 04:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
long time I did a lot of um letter
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
writing in the 1980s about product
 
04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
testing on animals the cruelty and
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
everything that was before computers
 
04:52:08.430 --> 04:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
letter writing um and a lot of progress
 
04:52:11.430 --> 04:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
has been made but this will
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
this will be a little bit more progress
 
04:52:15.548 --> 04:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
especially for New Hampshire and that's
 
04:52:18.110 --> 04:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
what we need and uh I'd also like to say
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
that um getting products that are that
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
are crueltyfree is not that difficult
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
anymore like in the 80s I used to have
 
04:52:26.510 --> 04:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
to send away for products that weren't
 
04:52:29.548 --> 04:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
tested on animals now even Dove has the
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
little uh bunny logo so you can buy all
 
04:52:35.670 --> 04:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
of Dove products and um even the dollar
 
04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people are concerned that
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
costs more even in the dollar store you
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
can find a lot of Cruelty
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
products amazing yeah when it says
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
825 where where is all this testing
 
04:52:53.190 --> 04:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
occurring um in labs around the country
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah like do you know which states or
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
don't have this law or where where where
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
where is a where are where are all these
 
04:53:02.510 --> 04:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
testings occurring I just I'm shocked
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't have the answer I haven't
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
been following it that closely maybe
 
04:53:09.548 --> 04:53:09.558 align:start position:0%
Kurt has it yeah I think Kurt might or
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
someone else might have that information
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
great I mean yeah probably in the New
 
04:53:18.070 --> 04:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
York I think Boston Harvard has
 
04:53:18.080 --> 04:53:19.750 align:start position:0%
York I think Boston Harvard has
Labs

04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
Labs
 
04:53:19.760 --> 04:53:21.910 align:start position:0%
Labs

environment so in honor of birthday and
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
in and in honor of the lab day today you
 
04:54:18.990 --> 04:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
know it' be great if everybody could
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
just buy cruelty free products it's
 
04:54:24.190 --> 04:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
really easy to do is it okay that I'm
 
04:54:26.130 --> 04:54:26.140 align:start position:0%
giving my cat prozac
 
04:54:26.140 --> 04:54:27.750 align:start position:0%
giving my cat prozac
[Laughter]

04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:54:30.310 --> 04:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
seriously yeah know I know pets are
 
04:54:36.590 --> 04:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:36.600 --> 04:54:38.470 align:start position:0%
 
IES

04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
IES
 
04:54:40.990 --> 04:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
spear an answer to that question
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
California has the most testing of
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
animals but they also have the most
 
04:54:48.670 --> 04:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive laws so I hate to say it
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
but the laws don't seem to be stopping
 
04:54:51.958 --> 04:54:55.670 align:start position:0%
but the laws don't seem to be stopping
it

04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
yeah got they don't love cosmetic
 
04:55:00.510 --> 04:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
testing in Cali that's about the only
 
04:55:02.590 --> 04:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
one that they
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
don't but that's the answer to it's
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
California and seconded by Texas
 
04:55:11.788 --> 04:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
Texas okay
 
04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you thanks you
 
04:55:15.868 --> 04:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
know another thing I'd like to say you
 
04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
know we all say we love animals and you
 
04:55:20.708 --> 04:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
know that's true it is true that if you
 
04:55:24.110 --> 04:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
take any po you know most people do love
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
them okay got one card
 
04:55:35.310 --> 04:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
left and Gina Powers
 
04:55:44.110 --> 04:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.470 --> 04:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this bill it looks like you
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:57.548 --> 04:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
means the investigation of biological
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
processes causes of disease either under
 
04:56:05.230 --> 04:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
biomedical research or um the definition
 
04:56:07.708 --> 04:56:07.718 align:start position:0%
of contract testing facility I think
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
that they're concerned that they would
 
04:56:09.558 --> 04:56:11.590 align:start position:0%
that they're concerned that they would
fall

04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
fall
 
04:56:15.150 --> 04:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
under that but I can get to that in my
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
testimony so thank you Mr chairman
 
04:56:19.070 --> 04:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:56:20.990 --> 04:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Gina powers from wrath young
 
04:56:22.868 --> 04:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
and Pignatelli here today on behalf of
 
04:56:25.350 --> 04:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College um in opposition to
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 97 um as amended by the
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
Senate um I have to issue a Maya kulpa
 
04:56:31.868 --> 04:56:31.878 align:start position:0%
to the committee as I did to the prime
 
04:56:34.470 --> 04:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor um admittedly we did not know
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
that this legislation was making its way
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
through the process um and we were just
 
04:56:41.230 --> 04:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
notified uh a little while ago that we
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
might have some concerns with the
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
testing that we do um at our facilities
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
at darmouth College um we take no
 
04:56:51.150 --> 04:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
position on the underlying bill um or
 
04:56:52.708 --> 04:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
the underlying policy I guess I should
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
say but we believe um that as written it
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
could have some unintended
 
04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
consequences um Dartmouth College is an
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
academic institution that receives
 
04:57:02.910 --> 04:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
funding for testing through the National
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
Institute of Health and the National
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
Science Foundation and that testing that
 
04:57:08.590 --> 04:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
they conduct at Dartmouth College
 
04:57:11.430 --> 04:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
directly um benefit the citizens of the
 
04:57:14.350 --> 04:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire um when
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
institutions such as Dartmouth College
 
04:57:18.190 --> 04:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
receive that Federal funding it ends up
 
04:57:20.390 --> 04:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
triggering a process and a requirement
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
that alternatives to animal testing must
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
be considered and the use of that
 
04:57:27.150 --> 04:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
testing of animal testing needs to be
 
04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
scientifically Justified and the
 
04:57:31.750 --> 04:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
definition of scientifically Justified
 
04:57:33.750 --> 04:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
means that Alternatives would be either
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
incomplete uninformative or infeasible
 
04:57:38.070 --> 04:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
and that the animal model is likely to
 
04:57:39.708 --> 04:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
yield important insights and that the
 
04:57:41.628 --> 04:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
studies are performed with the fewest
 
04:57:45.150 --> 04:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
animals possible um so unless amended um
 
04:57:48.030 --> 04:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth has concerns that the research
 
04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
um that they're doing that's
 
04:57:51.948 --> 04:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed um and federally funded
 
04:57:54.350 --> 04:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
that's developing new cancer treatments
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
um treatments for cystic fibrosis and
 
04:57:58.590 --> 04:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
efforts to address uh traumatic brain
 
04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
injuries um PTSD and the like um could
 
04:58:05.230 --> 04:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
not move forward um and so if the
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee decides that they um want to
 
04:58:09.070 --> 04:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
move forward the legislation we're just
 
04:58:11.470 --> 04:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
asking for um whether it be an exemption
 
04:58:14.430 --> 04:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
or that the committee consider amending
 
04:58:16.270 --> 04:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
one of the two definitions that I talked
 
04:58:18.670 --> 04:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
about relative to either biomedical
 
04:58:22.510 --> 04:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
research or contract testing facility um
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
to uh protect the the work that the
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
college is doing my understanding is
 
04:58:30.190 --> 04:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
that UNH also um has some of the same
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that we do um but unfortunately
 
04:58:34.510 --> 04:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
they were unable to be here today as
 
04:58:36.670 --> 04:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
well but I do know that um Dartmouth
 
04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
College and UNH um are willing to work
 
04:58:42.190 --> 04:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
with any subc commmittee and provide
 
04:58:44.030 --> 04:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
actual experts because believe it or not
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
I am not an expert in this uh in this
 
04:58:49.990 --> 04:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
field um to come and discuss things with
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee should they should they
 
04:58:54.910 --> 04:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
see fit um in speaking with Senator
 
04:58:57.390 --> 04:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
Waters and Mr aronburg um I do
 
04:58:59.070 --> 04:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
understand their concerns that any
 
04:59:02.670 --> 04:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that we propose um is very
 
04:59:05.310 --> 04:59:05.320 align:start position:0%
much tied to the definition of
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
biomedical research we're not doing any
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
sort of product testing um on cosme or
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
anything at the college so I think that
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
um we can definitely work with them to
 
04:59:18.548 --> 04:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
ensure that um animals are protected and
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
that um we are doing the research within
 
04:59:23.430 --> 04:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
the biomedical sphere so happy to try to
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might
 
04:59:28.948 --> 04:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
have representative MCU thank you Mr
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:59:32.270 --> 04:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
question is your concern about
 
04:59:34.230 --> 04:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
translational research
 
04:59:36.470 --> 04:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
primarily I would have to get back too
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
on that or follow up or for the question
 
04:59:44.670 --> 04:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
or is it more um use of animals in like
 
04:59:46.990 --> 04:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
acute or surgical intervention
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
training I do not believe it is training
 
04:59:53.310 --> 04:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
I believe it is just strictly um within
 
04:59:55.430 --> 04:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
the parameters of research for their
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
medical facility um they're not going to
 
05:00:00.948 --> 05:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
be putting any products out to to you
 
05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
know Society or anything like that I
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
don't think it actually has to do with
 
05:00:07.628 --> 05:00:07.638 align:start position:0%
um anything that maybe darmouth
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock is doing as far as um
 
05:00:12.510 --> 05:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
treatment or surgeries or surgical
 
05:00:14.548 --> 05:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
interventions or anything like that if
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I understand your question
 
05:00:19.670 --> 05:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
to be if we're having a subcommittee
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
that that'd be helpful to be able a
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
differentiate between translational TH
 
05:00:24.350 --> 05:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
or clinical therapeutic or clinical
 
05:00:25.948 --> 05:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
therapy or surgical intervention so we
 
05:00:28.270 --> 05:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
can clarify that if it needs to be I'm
 
05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
not sure it needs to be understood but
 
05:00:33.430 --> 05:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
if that's your ask it' be good to know
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
what your well I guess I was just going
 
05:00:38.190 --> 05:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
to Simply say is you have the the
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
language in front of you so have their
 
05:00:42.868 --> 05:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
legal beagles to uh yeah oh I didn't
 
05:00:44.190 --> 05:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
mean to say
 
05:00:47.548 --> 05:00:47.558 align:start position:0%
that well to review it no pun intended
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and change change it to add or
 
05:00:53.310 --> 05:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
subtract or whatever you know assume in
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
that sentence where the no provision of
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
this per you there's something they
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
might want to add to that sentence to
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
give clarification of what they they
 
05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
think they might be running a foul right
 
05:01:04.390 --> 05:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
and um that was the conversation that I
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
had with Mr aronberg and he just wanted
 
05:01:10.270 --> 05:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
it to be explicit that it was for um you
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
know a educational Institution for the
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
purposes of biomedical research or
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
something along those lines that was
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
linked so you can just find something to
 
05:01:20.230 --> 05:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
add to that sentence that would be great
 
05:01:22.510 --> 05:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
much any other questions seeing none
 
05:01:27.070 --> 05:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and having no more
 
05:02:09.830 --> 05:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.840 --> 05:02:47.868 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.390 --> 05:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
hey we'll open up the public hearing and
 
05:02:51.628 --> 05:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 365 and hear from the prime
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
sponsor Senator Waters I forgot you give
 
05:02:55.948 --> 05:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
my card I'll I'll hand it up to you at
 
05:02:58.270 --> 05:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
the end sorry we know who you
 
05:03:00.510 --> 05:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
are thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee again Senator David Waters
 
05:03:04.150 --> 05:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
District Ford introduce Senate Bill
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
365 relative to the sale or use of
 
05:03:08.510 --> 05:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries for electric
 
05:03:10.548 --> 05:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
bicycles Scooters or person Electric
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
Mobility devices a little bit of
 
05:03:14.830 --> 05:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
background on this bill um I think we've
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
all seen the uh great increase in
 
05:03:19.270 --> 05:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
popularity of ebikes and other e
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
Mobility devices especially if you go to
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
our you know more urban areas um you'll
 
05:03:26.350 --> 05:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
see great proliferation not only for
 
05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
transportation but for people running
 
05:03:30.788 --> 05:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
businesses delivery services and and so
 
05:03:33.510 --> 05:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
forth and there's been a concern about
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
the safety of the batteries uh used here
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
um you know I saw a couple reports
 
05:03:39.750 --> 05:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
around the country particularly out new
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
New York where there have been some some
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
fires that have been caused by um these
 
05:03:45.310 --> 05:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
batteries so I looked into it and tried
 
05:03:47.788 --> 05:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
to see what other places were doing to
 
05:03:50.548 --> 05:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
make sure we ensured uh Public Safety uh
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
with the use of these um batteries so I
 
05:03:54.110 --> 05:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
look particularly to an ordinance that
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
was passed in New York City and um and I
 
05:04:00.510 --> 05:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
believe out uh there's been a lot of
 
05:04:01.910 --> 05:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislation on this out in some of the
 
05:04:06.070 --> 05:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
western states Utah and Nevada where um
 
05:04:08.830 --> 05:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
the popular of ebikes is just soared out
 
05:04:10.390 --> 05:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
out out there and and the scooters and
 
05:04:13.628 --> 05:04:13.638 align:start position:0%
so forth um and uh you know it is
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
important for us to protect consumers
 
05:04:17.708 --> 05:04:17.718 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that the products they
 
05:04:20.110 --> 05:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
have are safe especially when it some
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
comes to something that can create a a
 
05:04:25.390 --> 05:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
fire um I'm really grateful to the work
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
with the State Fire Marshall uh Marshall
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
Tumi who is here uh to work on this
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
language and to develop um this this
 
05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill and uh the Fire Marshall and all
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of areas of fires that are
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
associated with the batteries and other
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
devices um you know a great deal of
 
05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
training and trying to keep up with the
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
this to make sure we have the
 
05:04:47.070 --> 05:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
protections that we need and so that's
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
what the bill is
 
05:04:51.628 --> 05:04:51.638 align:start position:0%
for just as an uh I will also mention
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
that you know well what are we really
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
looking at and it it seems from the
 
05:04:58.830 --> 05:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
research I could do that if you have
 
05:05:01.310 --> 05:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
batteries that are appropriately tested
 
05:05:04.110 --> 05:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
and labeled that the fire danger is
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
exceedingly low and rare but uh off
 
05:05:12.190 --> 05:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
Market aftermarket Market rebuilt
 
05:05:14.270 --> 05:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
counterfeit those can create some
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
problems I will note that there's a
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
recent report from Massachusetts on
 
05:05:21.548 --> 05:05:21.558 align:start position:0%
there were a total of 50 fires last year
 
05:05:24.510 --> 05:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
created by lithium I batteries uh none
 
05:05:26.830 --> 05:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
of them were for electric bikes or
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
Electric Mobility devices mostly were
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know our cell phones things like
 
05:05:33.548 --> 05:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
that and there was one car fire so I
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
said this is rare but I think we need
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
these Protections in place so that we
 
05:05:39.310 --> 05:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
know our consumers would be appropriate
 
05:05:42.430 --> 05:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
protected Ed and last thing I'll mention
 
05:05:44.670 --> 05:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
is that you know technology is moving so
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
fast on batteries and uh there is now
 
05:05:47.760 --> 05:05:48.948 align:start position:0%
fast on batteries and uh there is now
commercially

05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
commercially
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
available uh and I think it's going to
 
05:05:53.070 --> 05:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to replace almost all the the
 
05:05:54.750 --> 05:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
mobility device batteries there is a
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
solid state battery which cannot catch
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
fire and that is now being marketed by a
 
05:06:00.910 --> 05:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
European country we're going to we're
 
05:06:03.230 --> 05:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to see that eventually um become
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
the standard but for now I think we need
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
some protection so let me explain what
 
05:06:10.190 --> 05:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
the bill does uh the first looking
 
05:06:12.670 --> 05:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
statute I saw we did not have upto-date
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
definitions of batteries or of um
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
electric scooters or other devices so
 
05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
that that that part of the first part of
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
the bill um is uh definitional and
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
updating what we had in statute which
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
was out outdated since we first started
 
05:06:32.670 --> 05:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
to put these uh these controls in
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
statute um so the bill then uh addresses
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
two things um so uh on you'll see on H
 
05:06:44.548 --> 05:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
two um that we prohibit the distribution
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
or selling in the state of any lithium
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
ion batteries or chargers for light
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
electric powered vehicles or personal
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
Mobility devices that have not been
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
certified by a nationally uh recognized
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
testing laboratory and I list the
 
05:07:01.230 --> 05:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
current standards that are there for
 
05:07:06.030 --> 05:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
these um and please note on lines
 
05:07:08.390 --> 05:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
2122 you know working with this fire
 
05:07:10.910 --> 05:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
marshal Rec you know these standards new
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
standards will come along uh and so it
 
05:07:15.990 --> 05:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
would be under his purview to determine
 
05:07:17.470 --> 05:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
if there are additional standards that
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
could be used in judging the safety of
 
05:07:21.628 --> 05:07:21.638 align:start position:0%
the batteries since we passed in the
 
05:07:23.590 --> 05:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
Senate I've been approached by a couple
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
of companies most particularly Nemo it's
 
05:07:28.670 --> 05:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
the Outdoor Equipment company based in
 
05:07:30.548 --> 05:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
Dover and they do a lot of Defense
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
Contracting um they're one of the main
 
05:07:34.990 --> 05:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
suppliers for Department of fence and
 
05:07:36.548 --> 05:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
all kinds of uh camping and other
 
05:07:39.070 --> 05:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
equipment and they said that they are um
 
05:07:39.080 --> 05:07:40.310 align:start position:0%
equipment and they said that they are um
using

05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
um lithium ion batteries and some of
 
05:07:44.670 --> 05:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
their devices that are under the
 
05:07:47.590 --> 05:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
European Standard so I have an uh an
 
05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
amendment there which adds that European
 
05:07:53.868 --> 05:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
Standard um which I think is completely
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate and a strict standard and
 
05:07:57.470 --> 05:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
then still includes that the fire
 
05:07:59.708 --> 05:07:59.718 align:start position:0%
marshall is the best judge of which
 
05:08:01.868 --> 05:08:01.878 align:start position:0%
standards would be appropriate to use so
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
that that is what the amendment uh is
 
05:08:08.470 --> 05:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
there um then uh we want to have that
 
05:08:12.670 --> 05:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
that certification is visible on uh the
 
05:08:15.030 --> 05:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
packaging um or on the
 
05:08:20.788 --> 05:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
device um and then some exceptions uh if
 
05:08:23.708 --> 05:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
people are running bikes um and so on we
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
can't you know ex we can't kind of go
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
back in time and expect that uh these
 
05:08:32.350 --> 05:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
people will be uh required if it's sold
 
05:08:34.350 --> 05:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
secondhand or rented I mean you know
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's selling a secondhand bike and
 
05:08:38.510 --> 05:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
they may have scraped off that thing or
 
05:08:41.430 --> 05:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever um this is for new new per
 
05:08:44.708 --> 05:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
new ones um and then some violations
 
05:08:47.190 --> 05:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
there which are pretty standard
 
05:08:49.708 --> 05:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
violations for what I've seen other uh
 
05:08:53.590 --> 05:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities and States um doing um
 
05:08:56.270 --> 05:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
then the the aftermarket the second use
 
05:08:58.590 --> 05:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries and this one I
 
05:09:00.030 --> 05:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
think is particularly important for us
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
to have some regulation on um because
 
05:09:04.990 --> 05:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
here's where we can't know if that
 
05:09:08.390 --> 05:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
product is really safe um so that's why
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh the second the reconditioned or the
 
05:09:12.670 --> 05:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
second use ones there on page two line
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
six are are uh covered um on line 10 uh
 
05:09:20.110 --> 05:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
the the distinction is made between a
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
registered motor vehicle because those
 
05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
are covered by other things and the
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
unregistered ones because we do not
 
05:09:30.430 --> 05:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
require State registration of ebikes and
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh certain kinds of uh uh scooters as as
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
well um and then the sales provision
 
05:09:40.430 --> 05:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
starting on uh with H4
 
05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
um there's where we get into the uh that
 
05:09:47.070 --> 05:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
it must be sealed um must be attested
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
and approved by and then finally
 
05:09:53.750 --> 05:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
um people are pretty clever and
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
inventive when it comes to the getting
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
around the law and one thing that has be
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
has been noticed in New York and other
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
places that people are creating
 
05:10:02.638 --> 05:10:04.150 align:start position:0%
places that people are creating
counterfeit

05:10:04.150 --> 05:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
counterfeit
 
05:10:06.270 --> 05:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
stickers and so we need to have in
 
05:10:07.948 --> 05:10:07.958 align:start position:0%
statute that if you create a counterfeit
 
05:10:10.990 --> 05:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
sticker um you broken the law um so
 
05:10:12.670 --> 05:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and I think this
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
puts us in a good place to make sure as
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
these devices become more popular that
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
we have in statute what we need and I
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
and I you know the expert really on on
 
05:10:23.708 --> 05:10:23.718 align:start position:0%
all this is our our fire marshal and um
 
05:10:26.230 --> 05:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I really appreciate his help with
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
this and he's here to answer some of the
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
questions about what what they're seeing
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
in in the in the fire departments in the
 
05:10:33.548 --> 05:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
fire service so thank you Mr chairman
 
05:10:35.910 --> 05:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative baros thanks for
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
taking a question I don't know if I
 
05:10:40.470 --> 05:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
should ask you or or um the fire chief
 
05:10:43.750 --> 05:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
um I was contacted by the um uh um
 
05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
National Bike group and they suggested
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the standard that it
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
should say on it's line 19 that um
 
05:10:53.670 --> 05:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
instead of nationally recognized Testing
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
Lab laboratory that it' be ISO
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
accredited so I don't know you know if
 
05:11:01.030 --> 05:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
it that that was one suggestion and you
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned the European Standard and they
 
05:11:05.070 --> 05:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
delineated that as being
 
05:11:08.230 --> 05:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
en15194 so I thought I'd bring that up
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
as well thank you for that I'd heard
 
05:11:13.110 --> 05:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
from them too and I I will leave it to
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
um Marshall Tumi on this um I I do think
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
that last phrase as approved by the New
 
05:11:22.110 --> 05:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Fire Marshall that that
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
is quite comprehensive okay but if the
 
05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
Marshall thinks that it would be
 
05:11:28.150 --> 05:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate to mention that standard
 
05:11:31.230 --> 05:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
which I know the bike folks are have
 
05:11:34.230 --> 05:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
suggested of course it makes sense yeah
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you very much thank
 
05:11:42.110 --> 05:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and I I have to dash for
 
05:11:43.470 --> 05:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
another bill but if there are any
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions that anything I can do please
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%

05:11:59.868 --> 05:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
card okay uh Sean Tumi
 
05:12:04.910 --> 05:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
um are you are you are you are official
 
05:12:07.670 --> 05:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
fire fire marshall or director of The
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
Office good afternoon Sean to me I'm the
 
05:12:11.350 --> 05:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshall thank you for the
 
05:12:13.628 --> 05:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to this afternoon I
 
05:12:16.350 --> 05:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
think Senator Waters um laid things out
 
05:12:18.990 --> 05:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
pretty well um I don't leave doesn't
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
leave a lot we I did have the
 
05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with them in uh
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing this bill we crafted it on a
 
05:12:26.548 --> 05:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
lot of the um language and work that New
 
05:12:27.788 --> 05:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
York has been doing because they've been
 
05:12:29.150 --> 05:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
seeing and researching most of the
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
issues around e-mobility um fires and
 
05:12:34.830 --> 05:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
ebike fires um I think the biggest thing
 
05:12:37.628 --> 05:12:37.638 align:start position:0%
in in our our mind is that as Senator
 
05:12:39.708 --> 05:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
Waters indicated the
 
05:12:41.948 --> 05:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
um the ones that are are certified
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
products tend to have less issues and in
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh 2022 the consumer product safety
 
05:12:50.110 --> 05:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
commission uh really pushed on
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and resellers and others
 
05:12:55.150 --> 05:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
to try to move towards uh certifications
 
05:12:57.390 --> 05:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
and then in November of 23 there was a
 
05:12:59.910 --> 05:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
national uh campaign that identified six
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
areas that uh revolved around battery
 
05:13:03.948 --> 05:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
safety and the first one is uh choosing
 
05:13:05.510 --> 05:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
certified products so there's a real
 
05:13:07.948 --> 05:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
emphasis over the last couple years that
 
05:13:09.390 --> 05:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
we're certified products we're going to
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
have uh less issues around fire fires I
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
will say that capturing the data
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
nationally is a bit of a challenge our
 
05:13:21.150 --> 05:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
National Data um system for U fires is
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
um a little bit in the past and it's
 
05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
going under a significant rework with
 
05:13:26.910 --> 05:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
the US fire Administration right now uh
 
05:13:28.670 --> 05:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
we have been finding we've we've asked
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
Fire Chiefs in in New Hampshire to start
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
collecting it and giving us information
 
05:13:33.990 --> 05:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're fortunately only seeing about 8 to
 
05:13:35.708 --> 05:13:35.718 align:start position:0%
10 fires a year over the last couple
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
years around these types of devices but
 
05:13:40.548 --> 05:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
as the pop ity of increases we want to
 
05:13:41.948 --> 05:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
make sure we get ahead of some of the
 
05:13:44.030 --> 05:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
challenges and really try to I think set
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
up for Success um that we have the right
 
05:13:48.910 --> 05:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
devices good education and things like
 
05:13:52.030 --> 05:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
that so I think uh you know putting this
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
language in the bill and asking our
 
05:13:56.190 --> 05:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
consumers when they purchase new uh
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
devices to buy certified use certified I
 
05:13:59.708 --> 05:13:59.718 align:start position:0%
think would be a great step for fire
 
05:14:02.270 --> 05:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
safety for our citizens in the state um
 
05:14:05.708 --> 05:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
and I'd ask for you to support the bill
 
05:14:09.548 --> 05:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
any questions great questions
 
05:14:12.390 --> 05:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
oh over here representative
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
selling thank you and thank you for what
 
05:14:18.070 --> 05:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
you do so my question is around uh two
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
two parts the the enforcement part is
 
05:14:24.548 --> 05:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
number one and the consumer education is
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
another part so I'm not sure if that's
 
05:14:29.590 --> 05:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
included in this bill sure I think the
 
05:14:31.548 --> 05:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
the way the framework of the enforcement
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
could be left left to any real law
 
05:14:36.390 --> 05:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement um official it's open for
 
05:14:38.430 --> 05:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
the fines and um the structure is pretty
 
05:14:40.590 --> 05:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
open as far as far as uh any law
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh agency could enforce the
 
05:14:47.868 --> 05:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
fines if so if they needed to um as far
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
as the education goes we've been doing a
 
05:14:51.190 --> 05:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
lot of education on social media
 
05:14:53.350 --> 05:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
outreach in our office over the last um
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
probably two years um and we'll
 
05:14:58.788 --> 05:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
occasionally do uh informational um
 
05:15:01.470 --> 05:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
bulletins on uh lithium ion battery
 
05:15:03.070 --> 05:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
safety we've been doing a lot for the
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
fire service around suppression efforts
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
um working with the fire academy to do
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
more and more around training for the
 
05:15:11.230 --> 05:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
fire fire service service um any of the
 
05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
the events that we go to we try to have
 
05:15:16.110 --> 05:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
a component to lithium B battery safety
 
05:15:19.708 --> 05:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
as well there's a a bill also in um
 
05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's on the uh believe it's coming up
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar that talks about
 
05:15:26.750 --> 05:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle and lithium B battery
 
05:15:29.350 --> 05:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
um doing a a study um council is what
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
it's going to end up being and it's
 
05:15:33.070 --> 05:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
asked uh my office to be the meedi to be
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
the chair of it but to bring a bunch of
 
05:15:36.030 --> 05:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders across the state to
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
really look at lithium a bigger picture
 
05:15:40.470 --> 05:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries and electric vehicles
 
05:15:42.510 --> 05:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
and try to help get education and stuff
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
out so I think we're just I think we've
 
05:15:47.230 --> 05:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot more to do in the area
 
05:15:48.990 --> 05:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
but I think uh anything we can do to
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
kind of get ahead and and educate the
 
05:15:52.868 --> 05:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
consumers will be good so especially at
 
05:15:56.708 --> 05:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:59.310 --> 05:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
yeah representative M thank you Mr
 
05:16:00.350 --> 05:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:16:01.948 --> 05:16:01.958 align:start position:0%
question and thanks for doing what you
 
05:16:04.830 --> 05:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
do um any input on the definition of
 
05:16:06.910 --> 05:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
electric scooter was that taken from
 
05:16:10.708 --> 05:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
some other standard definition and yeah
 
05:16:13.510 --> 05:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
do that impact the the scooter the Lang
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
these definitions came uh mostly from
 
05:16:17.110 --> 05:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
the language that New York are craft and
 
05:16:18.270 --> 05:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
and stuff the work they did over the
 
05:16:20.110 --> 05:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
last year or two there so trying to
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
merror as closely as what the guidance
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
is that other areas in the country have
 
05:16:25.708 --> 05:16:25.718 align:start position:0%
done so it's try to trying to be
 
05:16:27.628 --> 05:16:27.638 align:start position:0%
consistent I think you know to the point
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
about the I think the iso and some of
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
that other language this is constantly
 
05:16:34.190 --> 05:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
evolving and it's moving pretty fast so
 
05:16:36.190 --> 05:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
I think um having a little bit of
 
05:16:38.030 --> 05:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility for me to like yeah that
 
05:16:39.350 --> 05:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
that nationally restur
 
05:16:41.910 --> 05:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized Testing Lab is is
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
good or you know uh that fits the mold
 
05:16:46.548 --> 05:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
of what we're after I think is is a good
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
thing um you know I think we we might
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
have to come back to you in in a year or
 
05:16:52.510 --> 05:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
two and make some other minor changes I
 
05:16:54.548 --> 05:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
think because it's just things are are
 
05:16:56.270 --> 05:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
moving a little bit faster than the
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
codes and standards around this in this
 
05:17:00.240 --> 05:17:01.788 align:start position:0%
codes and standards around this in this
area

05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
area
 
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
repres thank you thank you for taking
 
05:17:06.190 --> 05:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
our questions um I just had a question
 
05:17:09.670 --> 05:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
about uh data around the fires that have
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
been happening I've been reading about
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
them uh is there data to support that
 
05:17:16.788 --> 05:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
those fires were caused by
 
05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
uncertified uh batteries and
 
05:17:20.670 --> 05:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers is that supported by the
 
05:17:24.628 --> 05:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
data we thank you I we don't have I
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
don't say we don't have that to that
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
level in New Hampshire um how about
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
nationally nationally uh I'd have to do
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
a little B more research honestly on
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
that right now and just follow for the
 
05:17:37.150 --> 05:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
question mqu I just want to focus in on
 
05:17:39.628 --> 05:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
the word recondition online
 
05:17:43.628 --> 05:17:43.638 align:start position:0%
six um what H So currently are batteries
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
being reconditioned and repurposed and
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh where do the batteries go if they
 
05:17:50.310 --> 05:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
can't be reconditioned do they go to the
 
05:17:53.230 --> 05:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
landfill or do they go to you know does
 
05:17:55.270 --> 05:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
this pre prevent recycling if we prevent
 
05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
reconditioning there is um thank you
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities and there's some
 
05:18:01.670 --> 05:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh companies out there that do battery
 
05:18:05.230 --> 05:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
recycling at this point um and so that
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
that's available actually the in the
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
initiative that I talked about there is
 
05:18:11.948 --> 05:18:11.958 align:start position:0%
uh a point about proper disposal as well
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and there's a bill that was
 
05:18:15.310 --> 05:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
introduced this session that talks about
 
05:18:17.150 --> 05:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
proper disposal in New Hampshire as far
 
05:18:23.470 --> 05:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:26.590 --> 05:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
landfills represent post thank you Mr
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here today
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
um is that um would that be hazardous
 
05:18:35.548 --> 05:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
waste I believe that's where they put it
 
05:18:39.150 --> 05:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
into yeah yeah it's
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
I I do know in New Hampshire there are
 
05:18:44.270 --> 05:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
towns that no longer have uh the ability
 
05:18:47.070 --> 05:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
to um store hazardous waste where they
 
05:18:50.110 --> 05:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
are because
 
05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
um some conglomerate of uh towns had
 
05:18:55.868 --> 05:18:55.878 align:start position:0%
gotten together and then they disbanded
 
05:18:58.830 --> 05:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
so um we do have towns that are left
 
05:19:01.628 --> 05:19:01.638 align:start position:0%
without it so what what would we do with
 
05:19:03.990 --> 05:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
in that case I would have to research
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
that call
 
05:19:09.628 --> 05:19:09.638 align:start position:0%
me I'll store him at my house no
 
05:19:09.638 --> 05:19:11.110 align:start position:0%
me I'll store him at my house no

of Senator Dan Enis the Bill's Prime
 
05:21:01.230 --> 05:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh currently student loan

programs uh public at least State
 
05:21:05.910 --> 05:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
student loan programs in New Hampshire
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
are bonded through the New Hampshire
 
05:21:10.510 --> 05:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
higher educ ation assistance foundation
 
05:21:12.190 --> 05:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire health and
 
05:21:15.310 --> 05:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
education facilities Authority or hea
 
05:21:17.150 --> 05:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
this bill would simply empower the New
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business Finance Authority to
 
05:21:23.310 --> 05:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
also issue bonds for these student loans
 
05:21:25.590 --> 05:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
um this is a way they could issue them
 
05:21:28.430 --> 05:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
without fees would provide another path
 
05:21:31.150 --> 05:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
potentially for a more affordable way
 
05:21:35.230 --> 05:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
for students to uh Finance their higher
 
05:21:37.510 --> 05:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
education uh I will defer technical
 
05:21:40.110 --> 05:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
questions to the EXP s behind me uh who
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
are testifying in support of this bill
 
05:21:42.670 --> 05:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
but if you have any questions for
 
05:21:44.430 --> 05:21:44.440 align:start position:0%

05:22:05.230 --> 05:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
BFA yeah you got to press the button
 
05:22:07.070 --> 05:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
having me today uh for the record I'm
 
05:22:11.868 --> 05:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
James key Wallace executive director of
 
05:22:13.708 --> 05:22:13.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire business Finance
 
05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
Authority just here to make a couple
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
very quick points I think I said three
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
minutes on my card I'll try to stick to
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
it um and I'm happy to take any
 
05:22:23.628 --> 05:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
questions that that you'd like um Mr
 
05:22:26.350 --> 05:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
bossy summarized it well this simply
 
05:22:30.750 --> 05:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
adds the BFA to the allowed issuers of
 
05:22:34.470 --> 05:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
bonds that support lowcost student loans
 
05:22:36.830 --> 05:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
for kids going to school in New
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from New Hampshire their
 
05:22:42.030 --> 05:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
families things like that um this comes
 
05:22:44.910 --> 05:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
at no cost to the taxpayer um this is
 
05:22:46.830 --> 05:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
not a taxpayer supportive program
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's no fees paid out of the budget
 
05:22:53.110 --> 05:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
or any other sense uh for this these
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
bonds are actually private loans from
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
the capital markets going to private
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
families but there's a state agency in
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
that process who authorizes the What's
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
called the issuance of the bond and kind
 
05:23:08.788 --> 05:23:08.798 align:start position:0%
of looks it over and makes sure that
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
everything's compliant with regulations
 
05:23:14.110 --> 05:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
there are limits to how much a state can
 
05:23:16.750 --> 05:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
issue in these type of bonds each year
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
um these are not like the bonds that the
 
05:23:20.350 --> 05:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
state issues for like Capital planning
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
these are not State debts um and that
 
05:23:26.910 --> 05:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
limit is what's known as volume cap the
 
05:23:29.510 --> 05:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
BFA is the agency that receives that
 
05:23:32.350 --> 05:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
volume cap and the way it works now is
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
when a student loan provider needs to go
 
05:23:37.270 --> 05:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the market and get the capital to
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
make those loans they have to come to
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
the BFA apply to get the volume cap it
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
has to get transferred over to New
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hea the New Hampshire hea
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
issues the bonds and this just sort of
 
05:23:52.350 --> 05:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
allows them if they choose to cut out
 
05:23:54.548 --> 05:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
some of those intermediate steps it cuts
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
costs it makes the loans more affordable
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
for the families in New Hampshire um and
 
05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's just a more efficient kind of minor
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
tweak to the process and I'm happy to
 
05:24:11.868 --> 05:24:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:17.548 --> 05:24:17.558 align:start position:0%
Sullivan uh thank you for taking my
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
question so I'm just kind of curious
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
about the structure of all of this so if
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
if these bonds go bad or taxpayers on
 
05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
the hook no definitely not definitely
 
05:24:31.470 --> 05:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
not so if if so who who is on the hook
 
05:24:33.470 --> 05:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
then if if somebody stops paying them
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
back the lender yeah these are just
 
05:24:40.628 --> 05:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
normal loans student loans that lenders
 
05:24:42.670 --> 05:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
make to
 
05:24:45.670 --> 05:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
families okay so when the state's
 
05:24:48.150 --> 05:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
issuing or taking out bonds or issuing
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
Bonds on their behalf if that lender
 
05:24:52.830 --> 05:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
can't pay back to state for those bonds
 
05:24:54.430 --> 05:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
or am I misunderstanding how this all
 
05:24:56.670 --> 05:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
worse yeah it's a good question it's I
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
wish they were called something other
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
than bonds because there's really I mean
 
05:25:02.230 --> 05:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
the word bond can mean so many things
 
05:25:04.750 --> 05:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
right there's there's the type of bonds
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire issues to borrow
 
05:25:10.750 --> 05:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
money for right and they borrow money
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
and they spend it on all sorts of things
 
05:25:14.830 --> 05:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's another type of bond which are
 
05:25:17.470 --> 05:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
known as conduit bonds and that's the
 
05:25:18.990 --> 05:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
type of bond that we're talking about
 
05:25:21.070 --> 05:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's the type of bond the BFA issues
 
05:25:23.470 --> 05:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions you know on regular
 
05:25:27.830 --> 05:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
course what a conduit bond is is it goes
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
through a state agency because an agency
 
05:25:33.788 --> 05:25:33.798 align:start position:0%
by law has to say that the use of these
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
proceeds is what's known as qualified
 
05:25:37.788 --> 05:25:37.798 align:start position:0%
for its purpose so student loans for
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
student loans bonds docks and Wares and
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
airports for those kind of bonds but
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's called a conduit Bond because the
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
bond documents themselves say in no way
 
05:25:53.628 --> 05:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
remotely ever is the issuer or the state
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for the repayment of these
 
05:25:57.430 --> 05:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
bonds it's purely playing an
 
05:25:59.868 --> 05:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
administrative role to say do these
 
05:26:03.510 --> 05:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
bonds fit into the federal category that
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
allows the bonds to be issued in the
 
05:26:08.750 --> 05:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
first place um those are called conduit
 
05:26:11.350 --> 05:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
bonds um they're very very common
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're used all the time to finance all
 
05:26:16.590 --> 05:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
sorts of different projects um their
 
05:26:18.788 --> 05:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
private Market
 
05:26:21.270 --> 05:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
transactions um just as they are in this
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
case all right cool thank you yep
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
sure okay representative taxton so 45
 
05:26:31.708 --> 05:26:31.718 align:start position:0%
years ago the Commonwealth of Virginia
 
05:26:32.910 --> 05:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
had something called the Virginia
 
05:26:35.830 --> 05:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
educational Loan Authority they issued
 
05:26:38.470 --> 05:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
conduit barns my education is as a
 
05:26:40.510 --> 05:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
result of those
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
bonds at that time the private interest
 
05:26:46.750 --> 05:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
or the interest rates on the Pu on the
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
private market for typically for a house
 
05:26:51.190 --> 05:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
were around
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
15% maybe 13 depends upon the year and
 
05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh my student loans were at 7 and a
 
05:27:02.788 --> 05:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
half% which was a grand deal in my son's
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
experience who's roughly 40 years
 
05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
younger than me his he borrowed money to
 
05:27:10.830 --> 05:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
go to college in what was effectively a
 
05:27:13.708 --> 05:27:13.718 align:start position:0%
4 and a half% market and the interest
 
05:27:15.910 --> 05:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
rates on the private loans that he got
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
were at
 
05:27:22.270 --> 05:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
9% or 8ish or whatever so there's a
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
difference in the arrangement and the
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
when I borrowed the money and paid it
 
05:27:30.360 --> 05:27:31.948 align:start position:0%
when I borrowed the money and paid it
off

05:27:31.948 --> 05:27:31.958 align:start position:0%
off
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the there was a you could refinance
 
05:27:39.310 --> 05:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
so is the the two questions that I have
 
05:27:42.750 --> 05:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
regarding these potential loans this
 
05:27:45.628 --> 05:27:45.638 align:start position:0%
potential conduit for funding education
 
05:27:49.190 --> 05:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
are are you likely to be loaning the
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
money to New Hampshire students and
 
05:27:54.990 --> 05:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
families at or below current market
 
05:27:57.708 --> 05:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
rates or at or above Cur current market
 
05:28:01.590 --> 05:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
rates and do they is there a function in
 
05:28:04.230 --> 05:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
this Bond structure where would it would
 
05:28:06.750 --> 05:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
allow uh student borrowers because one
 
05:28:08.830 --> 05:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
of the big controversies in the public
 
05:28:11.788 --> 05:28:11.798 align:start position:0%
obviously today is student borrowing and
 
05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
it would help a significant number of
 
05:28:18.548 --> 05:28:18.558 align:start position:0%
borrowers who don't have uh uh who have
 
05:28:21.230 --> 05:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
student loans that would be able to
 
05:28:23.430 --> 05:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
refinance them at
 
05:28:26.110 --> 05:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
more Equitable rates than some of these
 
05:28:28.030 --> 05:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
kids borrowed money at 11 and a half
 
05:28:30.948 --> 05:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
percent so my that's my question is
 
05:28:32.708 --> 05:28:32.718 align:start position:0%
there a refinance option in here does
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
this provide for that which would go a
 
05:28:38.350 --> 05:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
long way to reduce pressure on student
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
borrowers and or is it new money
 
05:28:45.868 --> 05:28:45.878 align:start position:0%
only and uh the question is where where
 
05:28:47.548 --> 05:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
do you expect this to settle for
 
05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
interest rates is this going to be a
 
05:28:51.390 --> 05:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
premium rate because it's a sub subprime
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
product or is this going to be a
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
preferential rate because it's a good
 
05:28:57.430 --> 05:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
thing to do sure thank you
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative um so just to make sure
 
05:29:02.150 --> 05:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's 100% clear so the BFA is not
 
05:29:04.628 --> 05:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
lending any of this money to anyone
 
05:29:07.628 --> 05:29:07.638 align:start position:0%
we're just performing the function we're
 
05:29:10.270 --> 05:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
issuing the bond the New Hampshire
 
05:29:12.430 --> 05:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
higher education you know loan
 
05:29:13.750 --> 05:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
corporation they're the ones who are the
 
05:29:15.470 --> 05:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
student lenders and and deal with all of
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
that in in general and I don't know if
 
05:29:19.750 --> 05:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're here today actually but um in
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
general so the way that it works is
 
05:29:23.310 --> 05:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
these bonds are what are known as tax
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
exempt bonds um which means that when
 
05:29:28.110 --> 05:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
they're then offered to the ultimate
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
borrower they're typically about
 
05:29:34.548 --> 05:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
25% lower of an interest rate than what
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
the typical Market would be because the
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
the entity buying the bond sort of
 
05:29:41.750 --> 05:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
providing the big bulk of capital which
 
05:29:44.390 --> 05:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
then gets lent out you know they don't
 
05:29:46.708 --> 05:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
have to pay taxes on the money they earn
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
from that bond in exchange by lowering
 
05:29:52.150 --> 05:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
the rate by that same amount and
 
05:29:53.788 --> 05:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
depending on their tax bracket as an
 
05:29:56.110 --> 05:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
institutions typically about
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
25% which sort of lines up with what I
 
05:30:01.390 --> 05:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
heard your student loans were close
 
05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
anyhow um you know I I I can't speak to
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
I think you said it was your your son's
 
05:30:10.750 --> 05:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
situation but these are yeah yeah so
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
these would be tax exempt bonds for New
 
05:30:14.990 --> 05:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students who generally are
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
getting a better deal than they would
 
05:30:20.150 --> 05:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
get in the market because of their Nexus
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
to New
 
05:30:24.990 --> 05:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I I I don't know the
 
05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
answer to your refinance question I
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:37.310 --> 05:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
melier quick question who's the end
 
05:30:37.320 --> 05:30:38.868 align:start position:0%
melier quick question who's the end
owner

05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
owner
 
05:30:43.548 --> 05:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
Bond insti or is it typically
 
05:30:46.548 --> 05:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
a these
 
05:30:50.430 --> 05:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
bonds it depends so there are a couple
 
05:30:53.628 --> 05:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
ways to sell Bonds on the market and you
 
05:30:55.990 --> 05:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
know the way that you do it would
 
05:30:58.150 --> 05:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately be up to that higher
 
05:31:00.110 --> 05:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
education loan corporation or New
 
05:31:01.670 --> 05:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage I think it's called
 
05:31:04.788 --> 05:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
now um generally speaking it depends on
 
05:31:07.628 --> 05:31:07.638 align:start position:0%
the size so if the bond is big enough
 
05:31:09.948 --> 05:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
like let's say it's 20 million or 5050
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
million for example they would do what's
 
05:31:15.030 --> 05:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
called a public offering where they go
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
to the capital markets and you get like
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
the bank of americaas and US Banks to
 
05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
bid on the bonds and whoever gives the
 
05:31:25.548 --> 05:31:25.558 align:start position:0%
lowest interest rate in the private
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
Market buys the bonds um often times
 
05:31:33.270 --> 05:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
bonds are available for you know if
 
05:31:34.910 --> 05:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're on like your Fidelity account or
 
05:31:36.910 --> 05:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
whatever and you can see it um you could
 
05:31:39.868 --> 05:31:39.878 align:start position:0%
go buy Bond if they're rated for
 
05:31:43.628 --> 05:31:43.638 align:start position:0%
individual purchase um it depends on the
 
05:31:46.750 --> 05:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
on the bond by Bond just a quick follow
 
05:31:48.430 --> 05:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
what do you expect the rating on these
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
bonds to
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
be that's a great question I I'd have to
 
05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
defer that to the New Hampshire
 
05:31:57.230 --> 05:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage folks the um student loan
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
corporation it depends on how they
 
05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
package them I wish they were here
 
05:32:02.510 --> 05:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
actually yeah I assume other states have
 
05:32:04.708 --> 05:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
done this typically what have been the
 
05:32:06.030 --> 05:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
ratings do you know are you aware of
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
that I I'm not aware I this was just
 
05:32:10.310 --> 05:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
done last year I could probably go look
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
it up and come back to you in a few
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
minutes but um these are kind of a very
 
05:32:17.070 --> 05:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
normal thing that happen all the time in
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
the market thank you very much sure okay
 
05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%

05:32:26.670 --> 05:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
question um and uh chairman hunt
 
05:32:28.350 --> 05:32:28.360 align:start position:0%

access to this money for a student loan
 
05:32:47.910 --> 05:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire higher
 
05:32:50.310 --> 05:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
education loan corporation which is a
 
05:32:53.350 --> 05:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organiz you app directly yeah
 
05:32:54.910 --> 05:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
you would apply to them maybe it goes
 
05:32:56.190 --> 05:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
through the financial aid office at
 
05:32:58.430 --> 05:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
school used to have another
 
05:33:02.190 --> 05:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
name yeah was it was granite or
 
05:33:03.868 --> 05:33:03.878 align:start position:0%
something like that it was something was
 
05:33:06.350 --> 05:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
in Hampshire Granite State Management
 
05:33:08.430 --> 05:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
and Resources I think they they have a
 
05:33:10.430 --> 05:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
they had another I never was a name
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
another name for it but back when my
 
05:33:15.948 --> 05:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
kids were in college yes I I actually I
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
think I borrowed money from them same in
 
05:33:20.708 --> 05:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
the 90s yeah and remember the stone
 
05:33:23.230 --> 05:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
their logo the stone logo yeah I saw it
 
05:33:25.390 --> 05:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
every month I think but um yeah as
 
05:33:28.310 --> 05:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
someone who does buy bonds um your the
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
bond market is usually is bundled
 
05:33:32.430 --> 05:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
they're usually bundled in several other
 
05:33:36.110 --> 05:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
Bond issues and um and it's it's
 
05:33:39.030 --> 05:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
basically uh terms of your portfolio you
 
05:33:41.150 --> 05:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
want to have a balanced portfolio
 
05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
they're all definitely a a-rated bonds
 
05:33:48.868 --> 05:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
and there's not you know um but um there
 
05:33:50.910 --> 05:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
it is obviously for people who are
 
05:33:53.110 --> 05:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
interested in in investing in the bond
 
05:33:55.510 --> 05:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
market and and normally it's only
 
05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
someone who has enough that you want to
 
05:33:59.948 --> 05:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
spread around that you you want to have
 
05:34:03.070 --> 05:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
the bond market is is a safety net um
 
05:34:06.030 --> 05:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
you other most people are in the stock
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
market you're not necessarily in the
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
bond market
 
05:34:11.990 --> 05:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
so okay representing you're next oh I

was po
 
05:34:16.670 --> 05:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
outt oh I can't forget representative
 
05:34:20.310 --> 05:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.390 --> 05:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much um and
 
05:34:31.150 --> 05:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today uh so for
 
05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
um story I had a son that went to school
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
and um for a a grad school
 
05:34:40.430 --> 05:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
and he couldn't get any loans other than
 
05:34:43.070 --> 05:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
private loans and the only way he could
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
get any forgiveness while other people
 
05:34:48.590 --> 05:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
took you know loans um that you know
 
05:34:52.750 --> 05:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
weren't private um a lot of these people
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
got um their money paid back and now he
 
05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
is stuck
 
05:35:05.868 --> 05:35:05.878 align:start position:0%
with huge nut however with this
 
05:35:08.590 --> 05:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
program they they have have if you work
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
for a nonprofit for 10 years you get
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
they they pay they pay the rest of the
 
05:35:17.868 --> 05:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
loan off what's left is that what will
 
05:35:20.750 --> 05:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
happen with this program since this is
 
05:35:23.868 --> 05:35:23.878 align:start position:0%
private even though it's put through the
 
05:35:23.878 --> 05:35:24.990 align:start position:0%
private even though it's put through the
New

05:35:24.990 --> 05:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:35:25.000 --> 05:35:26.990 align:start position:0%
New
Hampshire

05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
um whatever it was called Advantage uh
 
05:35:32.150 --> 05:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you great
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
question I wish I knew the answer with
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
confidence um you know really because
 
05:35:39.670 --> 05:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
because the state's not the lender you
 
05:35:42.150 --> 05:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
know we we try not to get too entangled
 
05:35:44.470 --> 05:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
in the ins and outs of the actual loans
 
05:35:46.510 --> 05:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
to the students that's really for them
 
05:35:50.390 --> 05:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
to do but um you know I I think the
 
05:35:53.430 --> 05:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
federal student loan forgiveness program
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm aware is for federal
 
05:36:00.390 --> 05:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
student loans only and if I recall the
 
05:36:02.948 --> 05:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Advantage group used to be
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
a servicer of Federal loans I don't
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
believe that they are any more right I'm
 
05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
seeing some shaking heads back there so
 
05:36:14.510 --> 05:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think these are a separate thing um I
 
05:36:16.990 --> 05:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a private nonprofit um
 
05:36:20.830 --> 05:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
doing loans for people in New Hampshire
 
05:36:23.390 --> 05:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
yeah just just your information your
 
05:36:23.400 --> 05:36:24.868 align:start position:0%
yeah just just your information your
representative

05:36:24.868 --> 05:36:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:27.708 --> 05:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
post rep representative post have your
 
05:36:29.788 --> 05:36:29.798 align:start position:0%
son refinance his loans through a
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
federal agency and they have the new
 
05:36:33.030 --> 05:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
program that the government just had I
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
can't remember what it's called but if
 
05:36:35.948 --> 05:36:35.958 align:start position:0%
you refinance them through that they
 
05:36:37.150 --> 05:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
will do it and it'll become a Federal
 
05:36:40.470 --> 05:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:46.150 --> 05:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:48.910 --> 05:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
tell okay now representa am has a
 
05:36:50.830 --> 05:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you for taking
 
05:36:53.230 --> 05:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
my question um just to just to play off
 
05:36:55.270 --> 05:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
some of the previous questions let's say
 
05:36:57.788 --> 05:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
I'm me and a whole bunch of my young
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
friends took out loans through this Bond
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
and other people are getting their loans
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
paid off but we're not so we say we're
 
05:37:06.670 --> 05:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
not going to pay our loans either and we
 
05:37:08.670 --> 05:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
all do it at the same time time and the
 
05:37:11.470 --> 05:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
bond goes uh you know in default whose
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
credit rating is at risk I know I
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
understand the borrower but is is the
 
05:37:17.628 --> 05:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
state agency or the state itself is
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
their credit rating at risk thank you
 
05:37:22.150 --> 05:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
represent representative uh the state or
 
05:37:24.390 --> 05:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
any agency is most certainly not at risk
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're not guaranteeing the bond or
 
05:37:28.270 --> 05:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
correct putting our name on it or well I
 
05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
mean our name is there as issuer but
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're not putting our credit behind it
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
the entity that would be at risk would
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
be the New Hampshire higher education
 
05:37:38.990 --> 05:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
loan Corporation they're they're the
 
05:37:40.948 --> 05:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
obligor they're the ones who are
 
05:37:43.788 --> 05:37:43.798 align:start position:0%
borrowing the money to then go lend it
 
05:37:45.788 --> 05:37:45.798 align:start position:0%
and if they can't pay their bond back I
 
05:37:47.350 --> 05:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
mean it's a lot of people's problem but
 
05:37:49.150 --> 05:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
it's not the state's problem just a
 
05:37:51.150 --> 05:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
quick followup does it affect your
 
05:37:55.390 --> 05:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
ability to to uh issue the next Bond
 
05:37:57.470 --> 05:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
whatever that may be for does it affect
 
05:37:59.948 --> 05:37:59.958 align:start position:0%
your ability to to do that uh thank you
 
05:38:01.708 --> 05:38:01.718 align:start position:0%
it does not affect the BFA or the
 
05:38:03.788 --> 05:38:03.798 align:start position:0%
state's ability to issue bonds um for
 
05:38:07.628 --> 05:38:07.638 align:start position:0%
any other project it might affect that
 
05:38:09.548 --> 05:38:09.558 align:start position:0%
loan corporations ability to borrow debt
 
05:38:12.788 --> 05:38:12.798 align:start position:0%
in the future abut if they default um
 
05:38:16.350 --> 05:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
but that's that's pretty understandable
 
05:38:20.230 --> 05:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay ra representative raor thank
 
05:38:22.590 --> 05:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my question um how
 
05:38:24.750 --> 05:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
much money do you expect to float each
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
year in bonds and would you expect it to
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
be an ongoing yearly
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
event that's a great question
 
05:38:35.070 --> 05:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
representative um I believe there were 0
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
do in bonds issued for the the last
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
several years um there was I think 20 or
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
30 million in total issued in the most
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
recent 12 months um the first time in
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
quite a long time and it actually has to
 
05:38:51.548 --> 05:38:51.558 align:start position:0%
do with the interest rate uh dynamics
 
05:38:54.910 --> 05:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
that representative uh taxton um
 
05:38:56.948 --> 05:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
introduced before so that difference
 
05:38:58.830 --> 05:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
between the regular bond rate and the
 
05:39:03.868 --> 05:39:03.878 align:start position:0%
tax exempt rate is 25% right reduction
 
05:39:07.030 --> 05:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's only meaningful enough if rates
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
are high enough to make the discount
 
05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
sort of worth it in the market versus
 
05:39:13.548 --> 05:39:13.558 align:start position:0%
you know kind of transaction fees and
 
05:39:16.190 --> 05:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
things like that um so this was uh the
 
05:39:18.390 --> 05:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
first time in quite some time the
 
05:39:20.708 --> 05:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
student loan corporation tells me they
 
05:39:23.110 --> 05:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
expect the interest rate environment to
 
05:39:25.150 --> 05:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
be such that they'll be kind of in the
 
05:39:27.390 --> 05:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
market looking for bonds for the next
 
05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
couple years outside of that it's it
 
05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
becomes difficult to predict yeah
 
05:39:36.350 --> 05:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
followup for question me inquire um
 
05:39:38.230 --> 05:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of issues with
 
05:39:40.110 --> 05:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
student loan servicers over the years
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
who'll be servicing these
 
05:39:44.350 --> 05:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
loans they I believe service their own
 
05:39:49.150 --> 05:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
loans um in- house um and I'm not a
 
05:39:52.590 --> 05:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory body but Dr Google they have
 
05:39:54.548 --> 05:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
a pretty high
 
05:39:59.468 --> 05:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:02.910 --> 05:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much thanks
 
05:40:06.990 --> 05:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I have no more cards so we
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
will close close the public hearing and
 
05:40:08.878 --> 05:40:12.350 align:start position:0%
will close close the public hearing and

Daley Fett and I'm the Senate majority
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
caucus director I was asked to introduce
 
05:48:12.270 --> 05:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
this bill on behalf of Senator Lang
 
05:48:14.468 --> 05:48:14.478 align:start position:0%
sb515 would make modifications and
 
05:48:16.948 --> 05:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
updates to Consumer guarantee contracts
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
and is a request of the insurance
 
05:48:19.910 --> 05:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
department the insurance department
 
05:48:21.190 --> 05:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
testified in the Senate that there has
 
05:48:23.708 --> 05:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
been an influx of unbranded mailers and
 
05:48:25.230 --> 05:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
the department has received quite a few
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
complaints regarding this issue so this
 
05:48:28.670 --> 05:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
bill will help tighten up the state law
 
05:48:30.510 --> 05:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
so that unbranded mailers would need to
 
05:48:30.520 --> 05:48:31.750 align:start position:0%
so that unbranded mailers would need to
identify

05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
identify
 
05:48:33.468 --> 05:48:33.478 align:start position:0%
themselves I'm going to keep it very

I've been in coming here for 20 years my
 
05:49:24.270 --> 05:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
previous job um my name is James Fox I'm
 
05:49:25.468 --> 05:49:25.478 align:start position:0%
the PNC director at the New Hampshire
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
insurance department I'm joined by Josh
 
05:49:30.030 --> 05:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
hilard who's our uh enforcement counsel
 
05:49:31.708 --> 05:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
at the department uh this bill kind of
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
impacts both what I do which is PNC and
 
05:49:37.628 --> 05:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
what Josh does with his enforcement um
 
05:49:39.990 --> 05:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
the the statute we're addressing is a
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
415c which is consumer guarantee
 
05:49:45.310 --> 05:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
contracts which have uh kind of a unique
 
05:49:46.390 --> 05:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
distinction at the department that
 
05:49:48.310 --> 05:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're not Insurance U but they're
 
05:49:49.830 --> 05:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
similar enough to insurance that they're
 
05:49:53.468 --> 05:49:53.478 align:start position:0%
regulated by the department what they um
 
05:49:54.910 --> 05:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
what they are basically is if you buy a
 
05:49:56.150 --> 05:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
car and they said you would do like an
 
05:49:57.910 --> 05:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
extended warranty that's a consumer
 
05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
guarantee contract if you go to a store
 
05:50:02.750 --> 05:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
and buy pretty much anything that's
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
going to they'll offer you an extended
 
05:50:04.440 --> 05:50:05.510 align:start position:0%
going to they'll offer you an extended
uh

05:50:05.510 --> 05:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
warranty um the reason we're um
 
05:50:11.030 --> 05:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
modernizing or increasing regulation on
 
05:50:13.948 --> 05:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
the bill is that we've had basically um
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
the good actors in this area um the gray
 
05:50:20.190 --> 05:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
area actors and then the Bad actors um
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're not worried about the good actors
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh but the the gray area and the Bad
 
05:50:26.510 --> 05:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
actors uh have become a concern uh of
 
05:50:28.030 --> 05:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
recent times there seem to be more
 
05:50:29.990 --> 05:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
people out there um issuing these
 
05:50:31.548 --> 05:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
contracts have not registered with the
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
Department um we're not able to um
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
properly basically regulate them because
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
we're not sure who they are
 
05:50:40.468 --> 05:50:40.478 align:start position:0%
so um who gets hurt by that uh is the
 
05:50:42.830 --> 05:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable people in our population
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it's seniors um Josh will
 
05:50:48.150 --> 05:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
get into that a a little later but they
 
05:50:49.510 --> 05:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
receive phone calls from companies that
 
05:50:51.868 --> 05:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
not really 415c contracts and they can
 
05:50:54.110 --> 05:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
for example give out their um banking
 
05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
information and then they've compromised
 
05:50:57.070 --> 05:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
their Banking and then once they do that
 
05:50:58.990 --> 05:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
then they can get uh many many phone
 
05:51:01.150 --> 05:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
calls in a day every day uh and it
 
05:51:02.788 --> 05:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
becomes both a problem for the senior
 
05:51:05.030 --> 05:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
and for the senior's families um we
 
05:51:08.590 --> 05:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
partnered with uh a P um on addressing
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
these issues and what we've basically
 
05:51:12.830 --> 05:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
done is taken 415c which is the consumer
 
05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
guarantee contracts and made a few uh
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
changes to it um the first change is
 
05:51:20.190 --> 05:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
we've um strengthened identification uh
 
05:51:22.670 --> 05:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
in it so we know who the obligor are
 
05:51:23.788 --> 05:51:23.798 align:start position:0%
which that would be like the insurance
 
05:51:25.390 --> 05:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
company if for insurance and then who
 
05:51:26.830 --> 05:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
the administrators and the sellers are
 
05:51:29.350 --> 05:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
so we know each layer of person that's
 
05:51:31.390 --> 05:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
going to be interacting um with
 
05:51:34.468 --> 05:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
consumers and that way whatever we get
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
information wise we can trace it back to
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
the oore and then contact the obligor
 
05:51:41.350 --> 05:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
and have them U make the necessary
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
changes to whatever their behavior is
 
05:51:44.910 --> 05:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
and we'd also then also be able to find
 
05:51:46.548 --> 05:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
out that the entity we're dealing with
 
05:51:49.150 --> 05:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
is not registered with us and they then
 
05:51:50.830 --> 05:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
we take a different tact and try to stop
 
05:51:53.430 --> 05:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
them from um operating in the state at
 
05:51:56.070 --> 05:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
all um next thing that we did much like
 
05:51:58.390 --> 05:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
insurance if everybody doesn't know we
 
05:52:01.310 --> 05:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
receive most almost all insurance forms
 
05:52:04.468 --> 05:52:04.478 align:start position:0%
and we review most of them review 415c
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
contracts so now the um 415c companies
 
05:52:10.110 --> 05:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
will be submitting their forms to us for
 
05:52:12.510 --> 05:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
us to review um to make sure that they
 
05:52:13.948 --> 05:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
they meet the standards of
 
05:52:17.548 --> 05:52:17.558 align:start position:0%
415c and then the last piece um
 
05:52:20.070 --> 05:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's it looks a little the actual Bild
 
05:52:21.110 --> 05:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
looks longer but a lot of it was
 
05:52:23.390 --> 05:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
actually just reorganization um the last
 
05:52:25.590 --> 05:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
piece is we have more prohibited acts
 
05:52:27.190 --> 05:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
and in particular we're not going to
 
05:52:29.110 --> 05:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
allow unbranded solicitations so if
 
05:52:31.548 --> 05:52:31.558 align:start position:0%
you've ever gotten a mailer uh saying
 
05:52:33.628 --> 05:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
you know your your vehicle uh is in
 
05:52:35.788 --> 05:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
trouble because it's not been uh you
 
05:52:38.070 --> 05:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
don't you're ability coverage or is your
 
05:52:39.510 --> 05:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
coverage for your car is running out you
 
05:52:41.468 --> 05:52:41.478 align:start position:0%
must contact the company and then they
 
05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't say who they are um whatever car
 
05:52:47.150 --> 05:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
you have right in the past I always get
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
I love that when they send it for my SS
 
05:52:51.150 --> 05:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
right and I'm chairman hun I'm sure when
 
05:52:52.468 --> 05:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
you get it you throw it in the trash but
 
05:52:54.230 --> 05:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of seniors go oh my God
 
05:52:56.150 --> 05:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
is this the registration for my car I
 
05:52:58.868 --> 05:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
better call I could am I in trouble um
 
05:53:00.990 --> 05:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
so that so unbranded those are not
 
05:53:03.310 --> 05:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
allowed so now we can say public service
 
05:53:04.670 --> 05:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
announcements if you see receive an
 
05:53:07.590 --> 05:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
unbranded flyer that is illegal and you
 
05:53:08.830 --> 05:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
should everybody should throw it in the
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
trash very simply um we also are not
 
05:53:12.788 --> 05:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
going to allow the high pressure tactics
 
05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
which is the you know you must respond
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
with this many days um you're at risk
 
05:53:18.990 --> 05:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
your car is at risk um you could be
 
05:53:20.948 --> 05:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
liable for thousands of dollars th those
 
05:53:23.788 --> 05:53:23.798 align:start position:0%
are all going to be illegal and anything
 
05:53:26.110 --> 05:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
um that's targeted at seniors in
 
05:53:29.230 --> 05:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
particular uh is also going to be um IL
 
05:53:31.990 --> 05:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
illegal if this passes and get signed uh
 
05:53:34.430 --> 05:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
so we we spent and I I want to emphasize
 
05:53:36.190 --> 05:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
that we spend a lot of time uh working
 
05:53:39.070 --> 05:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
with with the the good actors uh and
 
05:53:41.310 --> 05:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
their and their industry Representatives
 
05:53:43.190 --> 05:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh and they've been uh very helpful and
 
05:53:45.468 --> 05:53:45.478 align:start position:0%
they have a a a similar concern because
 
05:53:48.030 --> 05:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
they don't want the uh a bad name for
 
05:53:50.350 --> 05:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
their industry so uh there are a lot of
 
05:53:52.390 --> 05:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
good actors out there they did help us
 
05:53:55.030 --> 05:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
with the bill um we went back and forth
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
and we think we've developed a bill that
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
will increase protections for the
 
05:54:01.868 --> 05:54:01.878 align:start position:0%
consumers um basically from us being
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
able to regulate better to know who
 
05:54:05.350 --> 05:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
we're regulating and and and basically
 
05:54:07.070 --> 05:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
be able to stop them like pressure
 
05:54:09.788 --> 05:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
Flyers weren't illegal prior to this um
 
05:54:11.150 --> 05:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
but I will also I will now hand it over
 
05:54:12.750 --> 05:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
to Josh to explain a little bit more
 
05:54:15.150 --> 05:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
from the enforcement perspective uh both
 
05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
prior to the the bill and what the bill
 
05:54:19.030 --> 05:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
would be like after the
 
05:54:22.510 --> 05:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
bill sure thank you James so as part of
 
05:54:25.070 --> 05:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
the enforcement division um I have the
 
05:54:27.030 --> 05:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
honor of trying to look into any of
 
05:54:28.468 --> 05:54:28.478 align:start position:0%
these complaints that come into the
 
05:54:30.670 --> 05:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
department and we've received many many
 
05:54:32.190 --> 05:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
complaints dozens of complaints from
 
05:54:33.990 --> 05:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
consumers both those who have purchased
 
05:54:35.230 --> 05:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
these products and those who have not
 
05:54:36.990 --> 05:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
purchased but who continue to receive
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
mailers or calls um that they find
 
05:54:41.350 --> 05:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
harassing but one of the difficulties we
 
05:54:43.230 --> 05:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
often times have is identifying who
 
05:54:45.670 --> 05:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
exactly is behind it because there's no
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
name on these mailers um myself and my
 
05:54:50.548 --> 05:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
team has spent countless hours trying to
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
track down some of these entities
 
05:54:54.390 --> 05:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
calling these numbers where um you know
 
05:54:55.750 --> 05:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's been actually very difficult that
 
05:54:57.948 --> 05:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
we've had some of these companies very
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
abusive towards myself and some of the
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
people I work with when we try to track
 
05:55:03.270 --> 05:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
down who these people are and make it
 
05:55:04.990 --> 05:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
known to them that you know we regulate
 
05:55:06.590 --> 05:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
you in the state you're a consumer
 
05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
guarantee contract provider or seller
 
05:55:10.590 --> 05:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
and we need to know more about you know
 
05:55:12.150 --> 05:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
who is the obligor backing this who are
 
05:55:14.590 --> 05:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
you selling this who are you selling to
 
05:55:16.948 --> 05:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
um and it's been quite difficult without
 
05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
um any sort of structure in terms of
 
05:55:21.070 --> 05:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
what's required on these mailers so in
 
05:55:22.070 --> 05:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
my eyes this is one of the most
 
05:55:24.150 --> 05:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
important changes though the others that
 
05:55:25.590 --> 05:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
James mentioned are also you know very
 
05:55:26.750 --> 05:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
important in terms of changes of
 
05:55:28.390 --> 05:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
tightening up this market and like he
 
05:55:30.510 --> 05:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
said um really going after the Bad
 
05:55:32.150 --> 05:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
actors in this market while still
 
05:55:33.948 --> 05:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
providing plenty of space for many of
 
05:55:35.468 --> 05:55:35.478 align:start position:0%
those good actors who work in this in
 
05:55:37.230 --> 05:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
this market to to service New Hampshire
 
05:55:40.830 --> 05:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
consumers happy to take any
 
05:55:44.390 --> 05:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions you do any solvency tests do
 
05:55:45.750 --> 05:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
we get
 
05:55:47.708 --> 05:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
financials the companies are required to
 
05:55:49.390 --> 05:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
post a bond but other than that there's
 
05:55:51.708 --> 05:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
no solvency tests okay because that's
 
05:55:52.788 --> 05:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
the whole reason it was given to the
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department in the first place
 
05:55:57.670 --> 05:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
these guaranteed contracts is because
 
05:56:00.190 --> 05:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
that's your expertise but okay so they
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
do have to post a bond yes okay
 
05:56:06.590 --> 05:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
cool are these extended warranties this
 
05:56:09.070 --> 05:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about when they at
 
05:56:11.310 --> 05:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
the point of sale they try to have you
 
05:56:12.990 --> 05:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
sign something you want an extended
 
05:56:14.670 --> 05:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
guarantee correct often times they're
 
05:56:16.670 --> 05:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
called extending warranties or service
 
05:56:18.788 --> 05:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
contracts and they're on things such as
 
05:56:20.390 --> 05:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know automobiles sometimes you get
 
05:56:22.628 --> 05:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
mail about home warranties or a
 
05:56:24.310 --> 05:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
different sorts of consumer products as
 
05:56:29.070 --> 05:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
well um Walmart does this for just about
 
05:56:31.390 --> 05:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
everything you buy there except for food
 
05:56:34.350 --> 05:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
if you plug it in Walmart does it do and
 
05:56:35.910 --> 05:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
just be clear it's not only at the point
 
05:56:37.070 --> 05:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
of say
 
05:56:38.468 --> 05:56:38.478 align:start position:0%
you're probably not as worried about the
 
05:56:41.230 --> 05:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
point of sale when it's the cold calls
 
05:56:43.190 --> 05:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
and mailings that are probably much more
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the problem
 
05:56:47.590 --> 05:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative
 
05:56:50.310 --> 05:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
taxon uh what about phone solicitations
 
05:56:52.430 --> 05:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
since I've been here this morning I've
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
had at least four calls come through on
 
05:56:58.310 --> 05:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
my cell phone where they're soliciting
 
05:57:01.788 --> 05:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
uh you know warranties or your car
 
05:57:06.350 --> 05:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
the the whatever the gasket on your your
 
05:57:07.990 --> 05:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
your warranty on your car that you sold
 
05:57:11.708 --> 05:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
three years ago is expired and I mean
 
05:57:13.750 --> 05:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's absurd and I don't even know where
 
05:57:16.270 --> 05:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
they get these I don't where they get I
 
05:57:17.430 --> 05:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
don't really understand where they get
 
05:57:21.750 --> 05:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
my number or what vehicle I own and
 
05:57:24.948 --> 05:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
so you know if you pick the phone up
 
05:57:27.708 --> 05:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
there's a long pause this is where you
 
05:57:30.670 --> 05:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
know the over 70 the older people here
 
05:57:33.390 --> 05:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh they you you get these phone calls
 
05:57:34.910 --> 05:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
and there's a gurgling and a banging
 
05:57:36.948 --> 05:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
sound and then you wind up with a that's
 
05:57:40.628 --> 05:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
when I hang up in a phone room and it's
 
05:57:43.590 --> 05:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
somebody who may not have the best
 
05:57:44.708 --> 05:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
understanding of the English language
 
05:57:46.190 --> 05:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to sell you a
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
warranty or something is that covered
 
05:57:50.948 --> 05:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
under this bill or is it just mailings
 
05:57:52.510 --> 05:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
no no that that would be also that would
 
05:57:54.070 --> 05:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
be saying that would be an illegal
 
05:57:55.868 --> 05:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
extended warranty that that would be
 
05:57:55.878 --> 05:57:58.070 align:start position:0%
extended warranty that that would be
prohibited

05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
05:58:01.030 --> 05:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
um let alone it violates the Do Not Call
 
05:58:03.868 --> 05:58:03.878 align:start position:0%
if you're listed and do not call if you
 
05:58:05.310 --> 05:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
have never done business with them
 
05:58:06.670 --> 05:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
before yeah right
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay rent M uh thank you chairman H um
 
05:58:12.270 --> 05:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
is there such thing as an actual
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate car warranty if you if you
 
05:58:18.670 --> 05:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
listen to their advertisements they say
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
buy this coverage and you'll be covered
 
05:58:24.670 --> 05:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
for all the repairs covered
 
05:58:27.910 --> 05:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
repairs nothing is covered that's my
 
05:58:33.430 --> 05:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:36.468 --> 05:58:36.478 align:start position:0%
covered well that's why we're we we're
 
05:58:37.830 --> 05:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
going to have form review too that they
 
05:58:40.510 --> 05:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
have to submit the forms for our review
 
05:58:42.548 --> 05:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
it's a long-standing rule in Insurance
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
you can't give out aery coverage so if
 
05:58:47.670 --> 05:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
it was an elusory coverage in 415c uh we
 
05:58:50.310 --> 05:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
would also uh be able to block that um
 
05:58:51.708 --> 05:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
but again as I said there are there are
 
05:58:55.150 --> 05:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
good actors uh in uh the market uh and
 
05:58:56.910 --> 05:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
then there's there a gray area and then
 
05:58:59.230 --> 05:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
there's the Absolut bad scam people who
 
05:59:00.868 --> 05:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
aren't registered and aren you're just
 
05:59:02.948 --> 05:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
basically trying to get your money um
 
05:59:05.270 --> 05:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to sort everybody out
 
05:59:07.948 --> 05:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
and make sure we can identify everybody
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
and then after this is in place for a
 
05:59:12.510 --> 05:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
few years we'll have a better
 
05:59:13.868 --> 05:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
understanding of uh who exactly
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
everybody is so this is to a certain
 
05:59:18.948 --> 05:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
extent maybe a step one I mean if if we
 
05:59:20.510 --> 05:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
find uh we're able to block the Bad
 
05:59:21.868 --> 05:59:21.878 align:start position:0%
actors and we don't need to do anything
 
05:59:24.430 --> 05:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
any further then we would be done but if
 
05:59:27.150 --> 05:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
if this um you know in the next few
 
05:59:28.430 --> 05:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
years and you know Insurance always
 
05:59:30.468 --> 05:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
takes a little time to catch up we
 
05:59:33.708 --> 05:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
determine that um more needs to be done
 
05:59:36.910 --> 05:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
then uh we'll be back yeah
 
05:59:38.590 --> 05:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
and I should add the department has been
 
05:59:40.230 --> 05:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
taking action against the Bad actors we
 
05:59:43.110 --> 05:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
have been able to identify and has both
 
05:59:44.510 --> 05:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
taken administrative action through the
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
hearings process as well as entered into
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
consent orders with a number of these
 
05:59:49.868 --> 05:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
entities where number of them either
 
05:59:51.670 --> 05:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
left the state or agreed to terms to
 
05:59:54.350 --> 05:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
comply with um the current state law as
 
05:59:56.868 --> 05:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
it is or face you know further Financial
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
penalties represent Grassi none of this
 
06:00:02.070 --> 06:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
would cover offshore companies that are
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
doing the scammers people that are not
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the United States oh that's
 
06:00:10.750 --> 06:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
no if if they were if they're um acting
 
06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
if they're calling you in the United
 
06:00:13.628 --> 06:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
States or or contacting or FL sending
 
06:00:15.150 --> 06:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
you a mailer in the United States then
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
that they need to be registered here
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
there like any insurance company that's
 
06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
acting in the United States now you know
 
06:00:23.190 --> 06:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
those entities may not care I mean this
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
they they're just going to do what they
 
06:00:26.270 --> 06:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
do um but that's why we want to try to
 
06:00:29.390 --> 06:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
organize what uh would constitute uh a
 
06:00:32.910 --> 06:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
good uh company for example um no
 
06:00:35.230 --> 06:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
unbranded um mailers and no high
 
06:00:37.750 --> 06:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
pressure tactic and then we can more
 
06:00:39.468 --> 06:00:39.478 align:start position:0%
confidently go to the public in New
 
06:00:40.788 --> 06:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's one of the things
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing with the ARP and and try to
 
06:00:45.350 --> 06:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
make it clear that if you receive
 
06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
something um like you know an unbranded
 
06:00:51.430 --> 06:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
mail or or or if you receive a cold call
 
06:00:54.310 --> 06:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
that um is not tied you should you
 
06:00:55.868 --> 06:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
should tell them to put it in the mail
 
06:00:57.230 --> 06:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
to you and you'll review it but don't
 
06:00:59.030 --> 06:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
buy anything over the phone I mean that
 
06:01:00.590 --> 06:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
would be rule number one we could
 
06:01:03.430 --> 06:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
already do that and we have done that um
 
06:01:05.990 --> 06:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
with AARP and different presentations um
 
06:01:07.510 --> 06:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh but it's harder to get the the
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
mailers now because they weren't illegal
 
06:01:11.990 --> 06:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
mailers they were just um unwise to
 
06:01:13.628 --> 06:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
respond to now they'll be
 
06:01:15.948 --> 06:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
illegal is it male
 
06:01:18.350 --> 06:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
fraud uh that's not our jurisdiction it
 
06:01:19.628 --> 06:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
could be I'm not sure mean for the under
 
06:01:22.270 --> 06:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
the postal I don't know yeah could be
 
06:01:25.070 --> 06:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent thank you Mr chair
 
06:01:26.548 --> 06:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions I I'm
 
06:01:28.628 --> 06:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
just confused by one couple lines in the
 
06:01:29.948 --> 06:01:29.958 align:start position:0%
bill and maybe you can explain it page
 
06:01:33.430 --> 06:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
25 the consumer does not have the so uh
 
06:01:40.590 --> 06:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
no no consumer guarantee contract shall
 
06:01:43.350 --> 06:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
provide that the consumer does not have
 
06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
the right to bring an action to enforce
 
06:01:47.948 --> 06:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
the terms of the contract or otherwise
 
06:01:51.830 --> 06:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
challenged enough like page three line
 
06:01:57.830 --> 06:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
25 so letter C there yeah Roman numer
 
06:02:01.590 --> 06:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
four just if you just explain like why
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
that is needed in the bill I just don't
 
06:02:08.948 --> 06:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
contract yeah you you got to go back to
 
06:02:13.628 --> 06:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
what the ran numeral right I understand
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's a you can't it's a Prohibition
 
06:02:17.628 --> 06:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
against no o a contract that says you
 
06:02:19.510 --> 06:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
can't enforce the contract I I didn't
 
06:02:21.150 --> 06:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
know that was a Poss possible thing you
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
could put in a contract well that that's
 
06:02:24.590 --> 06:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that that these
 
06:02:26.548 --> 06:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
contracts have things in them that you
 
06:02:28.310 --> 06:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
would think wouldn't be there but are
 
06:02:30.670 --> 06:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
there I mean I had I had one contract
 
06:02:33.750 --> 06:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
where I read and it said we we uh uh we
 
06:02:37.430 --> 06:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
provide coverage for uh
 
06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
um I was it was uh scratches and
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
dentless repair of dings or some repair
 
06:02:45.150 --> 06:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
some minor repair and then the exclusion
 
06:02:47.350 --> 06:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
had exactly what the coverage was so
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
you'd be I know you I know it sounds
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
like why would you need to put that why
 
06:02:53.150 --> 06:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
why would you have something that says
 
06:02:54.548 --> 06:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
you can't say the consumer is not a part
 
06:02:56.830 --> 06:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
of the contract but that's what the
 
06:02:58.350 --> 06:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
contracts are they're assuming the
 
06:03:00.830 --> 06:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
person doesn't read it right and then um
 
06:03:03.110 --> 06:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
but is that legally enforceable probably
 
06:03:05.310 --> 06:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
not but you know that again so if if
 
06:03:05.320 --> 06:03:06.510 align:start position:0%
not but you know that again so if if
you're

06:03:06.510 --> 06:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
you're
 
06:03:08.390 --> 06:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
if you sending it to an unsophisticated
 
06:03:10.708 --> 06:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
person uh and then they some people may
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
just think they're out of luck um so
 
06:03:13.948 --> 06:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
that's why we again we want to get so
 
06:03:15.948 --> 06:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
our our intent is to get the forms and
 
06:03:17.590 --> 06:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
then what we do is we we're going to do
 
06:03:19.270 --> 06:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
a kind of an audit of the forms we'll
 
06:03:21.070 --> 06:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
pull so many of them and kind of just
 
06:03:22.750 --> 06:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
keep reviewing them on a rotating basis
 
06:03:24.910 --> 06:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
and we catch things uh that shouldn't be
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
in there because they're literally
 
06:03:27.310 --> 06:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
listed here shouldn't be in there or
 
06:03:29.830 --> 06:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
anything we think is uh deceptive will
 
06:03:30.990 --> 06:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
have it uh
 
06:03:32.708 --> 06:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
removed thank
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
you um so if we're going to set a
 
06:03:37.548 --> 06:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
General rule of
 
06:03:40.990 --> 06:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
thumb that a contract an extended
 
06:03:43.590 --> 06:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
warranty contract that is sold in the
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
retail environment you just purchase I.E
 
06:03:50.788 --> 06:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
Walmart that one is probably going to be
 
06:03:52.590 --> 06:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
okay that contract is you know they
 
06:03:54.750 --> 06:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
probably or Staples always wants to sell
 
06:03:56.910 --> 06:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
when you you buy something but it's
 
06:03:59.948 --> 06:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
anything that is done through
 
06:04:05.788 --> 06:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
mail email text or phone call and I know
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
I know Josh wants to say one thing but I
 
06:04:09.468 --> 06:04:09.478 align:start position:0%
want say what I would say um that the
 
06:04:12.110 --> 06:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
larger the uh retailer probably the
 
06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
closer you ought to be uh being um in a
 
06:04:17.670 --> 06:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
good position but the smaller the
 
06:04:19.548 --> 06:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
retailer I think sometimes they get
 
06:04:22.190 --> 06:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
contacted and they they're um saying
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
well you know we if you sell these you
 
06:04:27.548 --> 06:04:27.558 align:start position:0%
know almost like we will sell these for
 
06:04:29.868 --> 06:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
you uh we'll do a mailer put your name
 
06:04:33.150 --> 06:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
at the top uh and uh and then that re
 
06:04:35.708 --> 06:04:35.718 align:start position:0%
that that retailer doesn't have a lot of
 
06:04:37.270 --> 06:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge about what's going on they
 
06:04:39.948 --> 06:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
they are getting a kind of a commission
 
06:04:42.750 --> 06:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
so I would say the larger so there are
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
examples of like Amazon is is a classic
 
06:04:47.628 --> 06:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
they do a lot of that and Walmart does
 
06:04:50.190 --> 06:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
and so you know my you know somewhat
 
06:04:52.468 --> 06:04:52.478 align:start position:0%
unsophisticated opinion is that the
 
06:04:54.670 --> 06:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
smaller the entity more likely they
 
06:04:55.990 --> 06:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
might just be partnering with someone
 
06:04:57.270 --> 06:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
who said that you know this is a
 
06:05:00.110 --> 06:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
something that can be sold in a kind as
 
06:05:01.468 --> 06:05:01.478 align:start position:0%
as an adjacent item to what you're
 
06:05:03.350 --> 06:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
selling and it has value and we we'll
 
06:05:04.990 --> 06:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
we'll let you have some of that value
 
06:05:07.230 --> 06:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
but I'll let Josh
 
06:05:08.310 --> 06:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things I would add chairman
 
06:05:10.270 --> 06:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hunt is that when it's at a point of
 
06:05:12.350 --> 06:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
sale like that the consumer knows where
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
to go when there's a concern they can
 
06:05:15.750 --> 06:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to the Walmart or the Staples
 
06:05:17.150 --> 06:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
and if they call us they can say I
 
06:05:19.070 --> 06:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
purchased this from Walmart or Staples
 
06:05:21.390 --> 06:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
the big issue we've been facing is when
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
consumers have purchased these products
 
06:05:24.750 --> 06:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
sort of sight unseen they receive a
 
06:05:26.590 --> 06:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
mailer that has no branding they receive
 
06:05:28.110 --> 06:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
a call and they provide their
 
06:05:29.468 --> 06:05:29.478 align:start position:0%
information and that sale goes through
 
06:05:30.990 --> 06:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
and then they come to us and say I
 
06:05:33.110 --> 06:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
bought this service contract and I'm not
 
06:05:34.590 --> 06:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
getting any of the benefits and then
 
06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's a real hurdle for us to even
 
06:05:38.110 --> 06:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
identify who we need to be taking action
 
06:05:39.868 --> 06:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
against in order to to make sure they're
 
06:05:41.310 --> 06:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
complying with the terms of the contract
 
06:05:43.750 --> 06:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the consumer
 
06:05:45.990 --> 06:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
great yes representative grassing yeah
 
06:05:48.590 --> 06:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
to follow up on on representative am's
 
06:05:50.830 --> 06:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
amon's question if you look at line 21
 
06:05:52.868 --> 06:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
it says those Provisions are not allowed
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
in any contracts yeah I totally
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
understood that yeah okay I I was just
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
curious why we would have to Pro
 
06:06:02.510 --> 06:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit it prohibit what is obviously
 
06:06:04.830 --> 06:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
nonsense right and I would just like to
 
06:06:06.190 --> 06:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
one thing you know you know we're saying
 
06:06:07.270 --> 06:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
that you know we have people who come
 
06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
and say they didn't receive anything but
 
06:06:10.868 --> 06:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
there's also uh we have had some
 
06:06:12.468 --> 06:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
relatives call and say that I was
 
06:06:14.830 --> 06:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
checking uh my mother or my father's
 
06:06:16.868 --> 06:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
bank account and there's a charge on
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
there and it looks like it's uh says
 
06:06:22.030 --> 06:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
Auto protection uh and uh can you look
 
06:06:24.150 --> 06:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
into that for us is that insurance and
 
06:06:26.230 --> 06:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's and it's um one of these bad actor
 
06:06:28.270 --> 06:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
companies and we say well did your
 
06:06:30.990 --> 06:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
parent receive anything in the mail no
 
06:06:34.070 --> 06:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
um basically they they they gave they
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
bought something over the phone never
 
06:06:37.830 --> 06:06:37.840 align:start position:0%

providers and administrators and of

course as you've just heard service
 
06:07:47.990 --> 06:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
contracts means extended warranties home
 
06:07:50.590 --> 06:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
warranty really any type of product that
 
06:07:52.230 --> 06:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
would protect your financial interests
 
06:07:54.590 --> 06:07:54.600 align:start position:0%

06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle to your household systems
 
06:08:00.628 --> 06:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
and appliances um as you've heard today
 
06:08:02.190 --> 06:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
I would like to think that I'm here
 
06:08:04.390 --> 06:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
today representing those good guys in
 
06:08:07.708 --> 06:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
this space these are valuable products
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
that a lot of consumers depend on to
 
06:08:11.670 --> 06:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
protect their finances most the average
 
06:08:15.150 --> 06:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
American Consumer cannot afford a $400
 
06:08:18.390 --> 06:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
or more unexpected expense and that's
 
06:08:20.190 --> 06:08:20.200 align:start position:0%
happens all the time from normal wear
 
06:08:22.830 --> 06:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
and tear and breakdown from your vehicle
 
06:08:25.868 --> 06:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
to your appliances or your HVAC system
 
06:08:28.310 --> 06:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
in your home whatever the case might be
 
06:08:30.190 --> 06:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
and these products help those consumers
 
06:08:33.070 --> 06:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
cover those expenses and so there are
 
06:08:34.510 --> 06:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
really valuable products that our
 
06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
members offer and we want them to be
 
06:08:38.868 --> 06:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
available to consumers in New Hampshire
 
06:08:40.670 --> 06:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
and we want to support the good actors
 
06:08:42.030 --> 06:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
that are offering those products and
 
06:08:44.030 --> 06:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
doing it the right way that goes from
 
06:08:45.670 --> 06:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
servicing claims all the way to
 
06:08:49.030 --> 06:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
marketing and that's why I'm here today
 
06:08:51.628 --> 06:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
to encourage you to support this bill uh
 
06:08:53.310 --> 06:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the Department of
 
06:08:55.190 --> 06:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
Insurance who has been very good about
 
06:08:56.750 --> 06:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
working with us and reaching out early
 
06:08:59.070 --> 06:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
on to make sure that we understand what
 
06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does and how we can help the
 
06:09:04.150 --> 06:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
insurance department to address concerns
 
06:09:06.230 --> 06:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
within the industry that Frank
 
06:09:07.990 --> 06:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh damage the reputation of the industry
 
06:09:09.750 --> 06:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
I've already heard it from some of you I
 
06:09:11.868 --> 06:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
know that there are Bad actors out there
 
06:09:14.270 --> 06:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
and there's bad conduct and frankly that
 
06:09:16.030 --> 06:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
makes my job a heck of a lot harder and
 
06:09:18.910 --> 06:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's not good for my member companies so
 
06:09:20.910 --> 06:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
for that for those reasons we really do
 
06:09:22.750 --> 06:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
support this legislation and we would
 
06:09:28.070 --> 06:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
encourage you to uh to uh vote a pass
 
06:09:29.590 --> 06:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll happy to be a
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
punching bag if you've had a bad
 
06:09:32.910 --> 06:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
experience with service contracts and
 
06:09:34.270 --> 06:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you might have
 
06:09:36.590 --> 06:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
right but the the point being is that uh
 
06:09:38.110 --> 06:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
you you want to sell these things you
 
06:09:40.310 --> 06:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
want to keep business so you want get
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
rid of the bad actor so we won't be so
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
gun-shy when these products are offered
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
to us yes absolutely so I have good and
 
06:09:50.430 --> 06:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
bad stories
 
06:09:54.030 --> 06:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
so my best story is when Volvo sold me a
 
06:09:57.310 --> 06:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
a a warranty on my tires of my car my
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
Volvo v90 which you might know is a very
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
a very limited edition that Volvo sold
 
06:10:05.910 --> 06:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
and they sold it with pelli tires and I
 
06:10:07.830 --> 06:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
go I don't know about pelli they really
 
06:10:10.270 --> 06:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
have a bad reput and he says okay well
 
06:10:12.270 --> 06:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
we'll sell you this for $1,200 we'll
 
06:10:15.590 --> 06:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
sell you g a warranty on those on those
 
06:10:17.948 --> 06:10:17.958 align:start position:0%
wheels and sure enough it didn't take me
 
06:10:19.548 --> 06:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
more than three months before I start
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
those plli started popping on me and so
 
06:10:24.670 --> 06:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
that was absolutely worthwhile that
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
warranty that I got
 
06:10:29.468 --> 06:10:29.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely and got Michelin instead all
 
06:10:31.190 --> 06:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
I did want to also chairman hunt address
 
06:10:32.670 --> 06:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned earlier Financial
 
06:10:34.230 --> 06:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
Assurance Provisions which are an
 
06:10:36.788 --> 06:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
important part of of how these products
 
06:10:39.310 --> 06:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
get offered and I did want to stress
 
06:10:41.030 --> 06:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
that the current consumer guaranteed
 
06:10:42.788 --> 06:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
contract law does have Financial
 
06:10:44.670 --> 06:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
Assurance Provisions in it they're
 
06:10:46.990 --> 06:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
relatively consistent with the niic
 
06:10:48.590 --> 06:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
model approach to regulating these
 
06:10:51.030 --> 06:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
products and so while there's a bond
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's actually um there are actually
 
06:10:55.230 --> 06:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
three different options for how uh
 
06:10:57.230 --> 06:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
companies comply with the financial
 
06:10:59.750 --> 06:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
Assurance it's not just a bond if you
 
06:11:01.510 --> 06:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
opt for the bond you have also have to
 
06:11:04.030 --> 06:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
maintain a funded Reserve account that's
 
06:11:06.910 --> 06:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
40% of any of the premiums received for
 
06:11:09.350 --> 06:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
these contracts and if you don't do that
 
06:11:11.150 --> 06:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
then you would have to maintain a
 
06:11:13.750 --> 06:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
contract liability insurance policy that
 
06:11:15.230 --> 06:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
backs these products so if anything
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
happens that insurance policy actually
 
06:11:20.390 --> 06:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
makes sure the clim is paid so there are
 
06:11:23.030 --> 06:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
um uh it's an insurance product behind
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
the insurance this is kind of like
 
06:11:26.510 --> 06:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
reinsurance kind of like
 
06:11:29.190 --> 06:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
reinsurance great yeah
 
06:11:32.948 --> 06:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
so all right thank you very much thank
 
06:11:36.110 --> 06:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
you very much and I have no more
 
06:11:39.990 --> 06:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
cards so we are
 
06:11:40.000 --> 06:11:41.548 align:start position:0%
cards so we are
done

06:11:41.548 --> 06:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:11:44.910 --> 06:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see
 
06:11:53.548 --> 06:11:53.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:56.628 --> 06:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
see we're waiting for an
 
06:12:03.230 --> 06:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:05.868 --> 06:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
up on
 
06:12:09.270 --> 06:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:34.110 --> 06:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:34.120 --> 06:13:04.110 align:start position:0%
 
long

06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:04.120 --> 06:13:34.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:34.040 --> 06:14:04.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:14:04.030 --> 06:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:04.040 --> 06:14:34.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:14:34.030 --> 06:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.040 --> 06:15:03.948 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:15:03.948 --> 06:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:03.958 --> 06:15:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:33.920 --> 06:16:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:16:03.910 --> 06:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:03.920 --> 06:16:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:33.840 --> 06:17:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:17:03.830 --> 06:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:54.190 --> 06:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:56.350 --> 06:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right so what we're going to do
 
06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is we're going to open up the
 
06:18:00.150 --> 06:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on Senate Bill
 
06:18:04.230 --> 06:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
407 and I am here pcel is here
 
06:18:07.628 --> 06:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
representing 's here and representative
 
06:18:09.468 --> 06:18:09.478 align:start position:0%
spear is sending in for representative
 
06:18:12.670 --> 06:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
Gibbs and representative burough is
 
06:18:15.788 --> 06:18:15.798 align:start position:0%
here okay so uh Alex you want to take
 
06:18:19.868 --> 06:18:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:22.548 --> 06:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
please and uh tell us tell us what we
 
06:18:25.948 --> 06:18:25.958 align:start position:0%
have in front of us okay I just realized
 
06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
I was probably going to be asked to do
 
06:18:31.270 --> 06:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
that well we hav't ask you to tell the
 
06:18:35.430 --> 06:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
story yet but yeah once upon a time
 
06:18:38.468 --> 06:18:38.478 align:start position:0%
there was a uh an
 
06:18:42.708 --> 06:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
amendment um this amendment
 
06:18:48.270 --> 06:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
um has three parts um and and uh the
 
06:18:49.670 --> 06:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
first thing I'd like to mention it has
 
06:18:51.830 --> 06:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
now become a session law because
 
06:18:56.788 --> 06:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
basically it is a um directive to carry
 
06:18:59.510 --> 06:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
out a project that will be finished
 
06:19:04.990 --> 06:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
within the year um and um at the advice
 
06:19:07.070 --> 06:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
of legislative Services I agreed that it
 
06:19:08.390 --> 06:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know should be written up as a
 
06:19:12.548 --> 06:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
session law um and it has
 
06:19:15.510 --> 06:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I think three main
 
06:19:17.910 --> 06:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
components um the first is the cost
 
06:19:20.510 --> 06:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement so there's
 
06:19:22.910 --> 06:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
requirement on am ground ambulance
 
06:19:25.788 --> 06:19:25.798 align:start position:0%
providers in the state to submit cost
 
06:19:28.430 --> 06:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
reports um the cost report will be
 
06:19:31.750 --> 06:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
designed by the Actuarial and accounting
 
06:19:34.910 --> 06:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
expert that gets retained to receive the
 
06:19:37.628 --> 06:19:37.638 align:start position:0%
reports but that expert is encouraged to
 
06:19:40.510 --> 06:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
use the Medicare cost reporting template
 
06:19:42.230 --> 06:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
that already exists and that people are
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with um and which I understand
 
06:19:48.390 --> 06:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
is no small task to
 
06:19:53.468 --> 06:19:53.478 align:start position:0%
complete um so and the um Commissioner
 
06:19:56.830 --> 06:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
of safety has the enforcement authority
 
06:19:59.750 --> 06:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
to set a deadline for the submission of
 
06:20:02.030 --> 06:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
those cost
 
06:20:04.948 --> 06:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
reports um which deadline will be worked
 
06:20:06.150 --> 06:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
out in
 
06:20:08.390 --> 06:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
consultation with the insurance
 
06:20:10.628 --> 06:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner who's responsible for
 
06:20:12.548 --> 06:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
making sure that this project moves
 
06:20:16.110 --> 06:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
along at a pace sufficient to be
 
06:20:18.070 --> 06:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
completed by the end of the
 
06:20:23.190 --> 06:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
year um so after the cost reporting um
 
06:20:25.468 --> 06:20:25.478 align:start position:0%
there's a process set up for the
 
06:20:28.708 --> 06:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
retention of a Actuarial accounting
 
06:20:32.110 --> 06:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
expert um which will go through the New
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health Plan uh which is
 
06:20:38.350 --> 06:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
um a quasi governmental entity that's
 
06:20:40.430 --> 06:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
supervised by the insurance commissioner
 
06:20:43.670 --> 06:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
and that performs specific government
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
functions around health insurance
 
06:20:51.190 --> 06:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
markets um so that entity has the
 
06:20:52.788 --> 06:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
authority to
 
06:20:56.430 --> 06:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
assess Health carriers uh to perform
 
06:20:59.670 --> 06:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
these functions and that assessment is
 
06:21:02.590 --> 06:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism uh that will pay
 
06:21:05.628 --> 06:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
for the cost of the study
 
06:21:09.868 --> 06:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
so step two then is the assessment and
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
the retention of the Actuarial and
 
06:21:17.030 --> 06:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
accounting expert um and
 
06:21:17.040 --> 06:21:18.628 align:start position:0%
accounting expert um and
then

06:21:18.628 --> 06:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:21:22.390 --> 06:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
um step three is the collection of the
 
06:21:25.190 --> 06:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
information um and the putting together
 
06:21:27.830 --> 06:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
of a report which will summarize the
 
06:21:32.110 --> 06:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
cost information and which will also um
 
06:21:35.150 --> 06:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
require the this firm
 
06:21:39.750 --> 06:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
to establish um what did I call it an
 
06:21:43.708 --> 06:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
illustrative uh fee schedule so what
 
06:21:45.948 --> 06:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
would a fee schedule look like Statewide
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
fee schedule look like that actually um
 
06:21:51.830 --> 06:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
paid based on
 
06:21:55.350 --> 06:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
cost um the cost based reimbursement
 
06:21:58.230 --> 06:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
system so
 
06:22:00.670 --> 06:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
um so the third step is actually just
 
06:22:02.230 --> 06:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
sort of the
 
06:22:05.150 --> 06:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
work of collecting the information and
 
06:22:06.830 --> 06:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
putting together a
 
06:22:10.510 --> 06:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
report um which includes um description
 
06:22:14.030 --> 06:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
of costs this illustrative fee
 
06:22:17.868 --> 06:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
schedule um and an Actuarial estimation
 
06:22:21.110 --> 06:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
of what the uh Prem the impact would be
 
06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
on health insurance premiums of a cost
 
06:22:26.190 --> 06:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
based reimbursement
 
06:22:26.200 --> 06:22:27.910 align:start position:0%
based reimbursement
model

06:22:27.910 --> 06:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
model
 
06:22:32.590 --> 06:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
um and um if you want to add a four step
 
06:22:35.310 --> 06:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
who would just be the submission of
 
06:22:40.868 --> 06:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:43.628 --> 06:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
information okay um I guess that I I
 
06:22:48.190 --> 06:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
want to uh accentuate or emphasize is um
 
06:22:50.310 --> 06:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
if starting at line 12 what we're you
 
06:22:54.390 --> 06:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
know beginning the effective date um and
 
06:22:55.990 --> 06:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
the process providing this of
 
06:22:56.000 --> 06:22:57.468 align:start position:0%
the process providing this of
Contracting

06:22:57.468 --> 06:22:57.478 align:start position:0%
Contracting
 
06:22:59.670 --> 06:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
within conducting the study the costs
 
06:23:01.708 --> 06:23:01.718 align:start position:0%
incurred in the revenue collected by the
 
06:23:04.110 --> 06:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance providers related to
 
06:23:06.390 --> 06:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
the provisions of ground ambulance
 
06:23:08.910 --> 06:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
services in the state
 
06:23:11.788 --> 06:23:11.798 align:start position:0%
including the cost of sustaining a
 
06:23:15.670 --> 06:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable operating margin in support
 
06:23:18.628 --> 06:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
of the expectation that the ground
 
06:23:20.510 --> 06:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers in the state
 
06:23:20.520 --> 06:23:22.868 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers in the state
maintain

06:23:22.868 --> 06:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
06:23:25.948 --> 06:23:25.958 align:start position:0%
Readiness to meet demand for the
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
services so it's not about just being
 
06:23:31.190 --> 06:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
fee for service here we're talking about
 
06:23:34.510 --> 06:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
you have we are going to consider the
 
06:23:35.750 --> 06:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
cost of the
 
06:23:38.788 --> 06:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
equipment and be having the uh the
 
06:23:42.270 --> 06:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
proper equipment and Personnel to
 
06:23:44.910 --> 06:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
provide the services that we were we all
 
06:23:47.110 --> 06:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
hope to get from our ambulances yes
 
06:23:49.070 --> 06:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
during the summit meetings we heard loud
 
06:23:51.990 --> 06:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
and clear that part of operating cost is
 
06:23:55.350 --> 06:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
this more intangible cost of
 
06:23:59.190 --> 06:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
Readiness and this this is uh directly
 
06:24:02.190 --> 06:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
from what came out of the the summit
 
06:24:04.150 --> 06:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
from this past we took our guidance from
 
06:24:06.270 --> 06:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
that so we're staying on that and on the
 
06:24:10.510 --> 06:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
task uh um of ultimately uh addressing
 
06:24:10.520 --> 06:24:12.030 align:start position:0%
task uh um of ultimately uh addressing
balance

06:24:12.030 --> 06:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
balance
 
06:24:12.040 --> 06:24:14.310 align:start position:0%
balance
billing

06:24:14.310 --> 06:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
billing
 
06:24:18.468 --> 06:24:18.478 align:start position:0%
yes okay question
 
06:24:21.948 --> 06:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
yes the study would assume that all uh
 
06:24:25.708 --> 06:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
payers paid the same rate I believe um
 
06:24:27.708 --> 06:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
could you that's a little bit different
 
06:24:29.788 --> 06:24:29.798 align:start position:0%
than what we were talking about uh no I
 
06:24:31.868 --> 06:24:31.878 align:start position:0%
think it it it's the same as what we
 
06:24:34.910 --> 06:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
were talking about um
 
06:24:34.920 --> 06:24:39.110 align:start position:0%
were talking about um
if

06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:43.070 --> 06:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
um if the cost of providing Services
 
06:24:48.110 --> 06:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
were defined in a way that
 
06:24:51.390 --> 06:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
um took into account uh the fact that
 
06:24:54.910 --> 06:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
certain payers don't pay costs up to
 
06:25:00.430 --> 06:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
that cost level um then the notion of
 
06:25:02.510 --> 06:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know cost based reimbursement for
 
06:25:04.430 --> 06:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
the commercial payers they're only 10%
 
06:25:07.910 --> 06:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the market would be
 
06:25:10.350 --> 06:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
like absurdly
 
06:25:10.360 --> 06:25:11.910 align:start position:0%
like absurdly
inflated

06:25:11.910 --> 06:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
inflated
 
06:25:16.548 --> 06:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
um uh I worked out a little mathematical
 
06:25:20.350 --> 06:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
example of what that might mean but um
 
06:25:22.910 --> 06:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
just in support of this idea that cost
 
06:25:25.670 --> 06:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
Bas reimbursement has to be well let me
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
just back up and say that um one of the
 
06:25:31.670 --> 06:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
fire chiefs who participated in the
 
06:25:35.990 --> 06:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
summit would frequently just talk about
 
06:25:39.910 --> 06:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
um his cost in terms of the overall
 
06:25:42.670 --> 06:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
operating costs
 
06:25:47.310 --> 06:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
um uh divided by the number of services
 
06:25:50.628 --> 06:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
they provide per year um and that
 
06:25:54.070 --> 06:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
results in a single number which is
 
06:25:56.310 --> 06:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
their cost regardless of who the payer
 
06:26:00.190 --> 06:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
is so we're taking a similar approach to
 
06:26:04.310 --> 06:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
that um and I'm also saying that it um
 
06:26:08.270 --> 06:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
cost based uh reimbursement um doesn't
 
06:26:09.910 --> 06:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
really make sense if you have to take
 
06:26:13.270 --> 06:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
into account that certain payers are not
 
06:26:15.948 --> 06:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
up to that level just quick followup
 
06:26:19.788 --> 06:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
further question um so out of the study
 
06:26:21.750 --> 06:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday or the day before yesterday
 
06:26:25.030 --> 06:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
was uh we were talking about 325 per of
 
06:26:29.628 --> 06:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
Medicare for for the uh the commercial
 
06:26:31.590 --> 06:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
the two commercial payers that we had
 
06:26:34.230 --> 06:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
right um this study isn't going to give
 
06:26:37.030 --> 06:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
give us a magic number of 325 or
 
06:26:38.948 --> 06:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
whatever it should be we'll have we'd
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
have to take the results of the study
 
06:26:42.190 --> 06:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
and then sort of do some calculations
 
06:26:44.190 --> 06:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of this is that
 
06:26:48.628 --> 06:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
right if actually we are asking the
 
06:26:54.788 --> 06:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
actual expert to um provide us with this
 
06:26:58.030 --> 06:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
illustrative um Statewide rate schedule
 
06:27:00.830 --> 06:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
which can be compared to Medicare so we
 
06:27:06.830 --> 06:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:08.270 --> 06:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
in fact they're allowed
 
06:27:11.190 --> 06:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
to uh illustrate that a luster rate
 
06:27:13.948 --> 06:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
schedule as a percent of Medicare if if
 
06:27:15.430 --> 06:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
they feel that's it's
 
06:27:19.270 --> 06:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate but it but it won't it be it
 
06:27:21.468 --> 06:27:21.478 align:start position:0%
won't be prescriptive of what the payers
 
06:27:23.948 --> 06:27:23.958 align:start position:0%
should pay to make up for the lack of
 
06:27:26.230 --> 06:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare funding right that it would be
 
06:27:29.430 --> 06:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
in an all-payer system um and it would
 
06:27:31.510 --> 06:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
be treating everyone equally basically
 
06:27:33.510 --> 06:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
right and there is such a thing that
 
06:27:36.030 --> 06:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
some states that it requires a federal
 
06:27:40.548 --> 06:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
waiver um of Medicare and Medicaid um
 
06:27:42.468 --> 06:27:42.478 align:start position:0%
but there are a few states that have all
 
06:27:45.390 --> 06:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
payer systems in which all payers pay
 
06:27:49.990 --> 06:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
the same rate for uh specified
 
06:27:52.590 --> 06:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
service that's the
 
06:27:54.910 --> 06:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
goal that's that's what we're trying to
 
06:27:58.390 --> 06:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
get to so to make this
 
06:28:01.948 --> 06:28:01.958 align:start position:0%
Fair okay so this is yes repres
 
06:28:04.990 --> 06:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
spear you have a date of December 31st
 
06:28:07.548 --> 06:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
2024 the end of this year to get this
 
06:28:10.468 --> 06:28:10.478 align:start position:0%
report out what's the risk on that of
 
06:28:12.670 --> 06:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
not meeting the deadline of making
 
06:28:16.190 --> 06:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
it um that certain of us will suffer a
 
06:28:21.350 --> 06:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:26.070 --> 06:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:30.030 --> 06:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
deadline um I feel confident enough yes
 
06:28:33.070 --> 06:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh with the way it's set up that that we
 
06:28:36.670 --> 06:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:38.750 --> 06:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative M thank you Mr
 
06:28:40.310 --> 06:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you so much for putting
 
06:28:44.230 --> 06:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
this together Alex um what's the
 
06:28:46.750 --> 06:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
relative what what's approximately the
 
06:28:49.110 --> 06:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of this and the reason I ask is
 
06:28:50.910 --> 06:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wor this is going to finance
 
06:28:52.708 --> 06:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
right this is going to finance so that's
 
06:28:54.750 --> 06:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
a little B so let them worry about that
 
06:28:57.948 --> 06:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of exactly my
 
06:29:02.830 --> 06:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
worry uh is that we we risk no we do
 
06:29:05.468 --> 06:29:05.478 align:start position:0%
have the money that's in this bill it's
 
06:29:08.350 --> 06:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
going to be funded through the healthare
 
06:29:11.230 --> 06:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
fund okay so we have the money all
 
06:29:14.350 --> 06:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
finances has to do is agree to allocate
 
06:29:16.190 --> 06:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
the money and and and budgetarily
 
06:29:18.350 --> 06:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
process it but there we do have the
 
06:29:19.868 --> 06:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
money this is not coming out of General
 
06:29:22.310 --> 06:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
funds to pay for this study so the
 
06:29:25.070 --> 06:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
chairman feels there's relatively low
 
06:29:26.868 --> 06:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
risk that they would say we don't have
 
06:29:28.510 --> 06:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
the money and you just pass all these
 
06:29:30.468 --> 06:29:30.478 align:start position:0%
bills that are unfunded and you can't do
 
06:29:31.948 --> 06:29:31.958 align:start position:0%
your pay and
 
06:29:35.310 --> 06:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
study May can I turn my mic off and tell
 
06:29:37.468 --> 06:29:37.478 align:start position:0%
you what I think about
 
06:29:39.708 --> 06:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
Finance no I'm I'm I'm I'm really I'm
 
06:29:41.350 --> 06:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
really asking because I I guess my
 
06:29:44.150 --> 06:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
followup is could there was there was
 
06:29:46.350 --> 06:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
some informal discussion about
 
06:29:46.360 --> 06:29:48.030 align:start position:0%
some informal discussion about
maybe

06:29:48.030 --> 06:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
06:29:50.868 --> 06:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
uh G collecting this
 
06:29:54.830 --> 06:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
data over the course of a a year or two
 
06:29:56.670 --> 06:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
and sunsetting and then having the
 
06:29:59.110 --> 06:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
industry basically live with the results
 
06:30:01.350 --> 06:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
like the the Real Results you know
 
06:30:02.510 --> 06:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
putting in a
 
06:30:06.430 --> 06:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
number whether it's you know 150 200 325
 
06:30:08.310 --> 06:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
like other states or whatever and then
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
collect the real data and then that's
 
06:30:14.150 --> 06:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
the number so the data is um we are
 
06:30:15.750 --> 06:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
looking back this is going to look back
 
06:30:18.070 --> 06:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
so it's not you know we're not we're not
 
06:30:20.590 --> 06:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
creating new data so we're looking back
 
06:30:23.868 --> 06:30:23.878 align:start position:0%
at it and um and the subcommittee felt
 
06:30:25.948 --> 06:30:25.958 align:start position:0%
that this is the right way to
 
06:30:29.468 --> 06:30:29.478 align:start position:0%
go so could not not to try to go ahead
 
06:30:33.110 --> 06:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
and pass numbers and sunset it and and
 
06:30:35.990 --> 06:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
then having the angst of changing the
 
06:30:37.788 --> 06:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
system at that point based upon new
 
06:30:40.070 --> 06:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
numbers that we think the best answer is
 
06:30:42.788 --> 06:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
for us to spend a little time do this in
 
06:30:45.468 --> 06:30:45.478 align:start position:0%
a an orderly process I mean to be frank
 
06:30:47.910 --> 06:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
I thought that we were going to get
 
06:30:49.788 --> 06:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
something like this right out after the
 
06:30:52.708 --> 06:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
summit met anyways I was surprised to
 
06:30:54.350 --> 06:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
you know that see the bill that came
 
06:30:56.150 --> 06:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
over from the Senate because that's not
 
06:30:59.468 --> 06:30:59.478 align:start position:0%
what what we were expecting so we since
 
06:31:02.190 --> 06:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
we heard from Alex 325 number being
 
06:31:03.990 --> 06:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
close to reasonable in customer
 
06:31:05.628 --> 06:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
yesterday that's what I understood now
 
06:31:08.910 --> 06:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
right now let's you know it we're if if
 
06:31:11.628 --> 06:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
you want to debate the other Bill and
 
06:31:13.628 --> 06:31:13.638 align:start position:0%
turn turn this down and take up another
 
06:31:16.510 --> 06:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
one um you know that's your OPP your
 
06:31:17.868 --> 06:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that because this is
 
06:31:19.590 --> 06:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee right now and you on
 
06:31:21.310 --> 06:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
the subcomittee that's not that's not
 
06:31:23.110 --> 06:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm suggesting I'm I'm just saying
 
06:31:24.750 --> 06:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
could could we accomplish the same thing
 
06:31:26.990 --> 06:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
and provide some more immediate relief
 
06:31:29.430 --> 06:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
or so if we if we do the do the the
 
06:31:32.750 --> 06:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
study committee bill or the study bill
 
06:31:34.628 --> 06:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
and it comes back in December new
 
06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
legislation then it's effective so it's
 
06:31:38.590 --> 06:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking like what about a year
 
06:31:40.510 --> 06:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
year and a half out before effective
 
06:31:41.750 --> 06:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
year delay no matter what year and a
 
06:31:43.910 --> 06:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
half it's a year but in the end of the
 
06:31:45.590 --> 06:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
day that's the appropriate way to do
 
06:31:47.190 --> 06:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
these things you don't you don't you
 
06:31:49.990 --> 06:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't give some money I mean I know in
 
06:31:52.628 --> 06:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
your mind that this is that that this is
 
06:31:55.468 --> 06:31:55.478 align:start position:0%
critical that they get money right away
 
06:31:57.350 --> 06:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
but I would bet venture to say that when
 
06:32:00.110 --> 06:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
you were here 20 years ago you heard the
 
06:32:03.990 --> 06:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
same issues back then that how how they
 
06:32:06.270 --> 06:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
were underfunded a ambulance companies
 
06:32:09.628 --> 06:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
were struggling then too correct
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Pell so the
 
06:32:16.230 --> 06:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
completion the end ofe completion date
 
06:32:18.510 --> 06:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
is really contingent on being able to
 
06:32:21.590 --> 06:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
get the data so do you feel that the
 
06:32:26.468 --> 06:32:26.478 align:start position:0%
requirements under um section one Roman
 
06:32:29.510 --> 06:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
numeral one are sufficient to make sure
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
that you get the data by from the
 
06:32:35.030 --> 06:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies do you feel that's
 
06:32:38.628 --> 06:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
yes the um the safety commissioner has
 
06:32:42.628 --> 06:32:42.638 align:start position:0%
the authority to set the due date um and
 
06:32:44.468 --> 06:32:44.478 align:start position:0%
it will have to be fairly
 
06:32:46.548 --> 06:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
aggressive it'll have to be fairly
 
06:32:49.590 --> 06:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
aggressive to get all this data yes and
 
06:32:51.388 --> 06:32:51.398 align:start position:0%
this also provides that that due date
 
06:32:53.548 --> 06:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
gets worked out collaboratively with the
 
06:32:55.030 --> 06:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner who's going to be
 
06:32:57.190 --> 06:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
more familiar with the whole project
 
06:33:01.030 --> 06:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
plan right um but it will have to be
 
06:33:03.350 --> 06:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
aggressive in order to make I assume
 
06:33:05.830 --> 06:33:05.840 align:start position:0%

make any movement on this it would
 
06:33:15.750 --> 06:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
behoove the ambulance companies to get
