good morning everyone and welcome to the
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
house committee on Health and Human
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs as noticed

uh for executive session but before we
 
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
get into those I'd ask you to please
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
Allegiance I pledge allegiance to the
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
flag of the United States of America and
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
to the Republic for which it stands one
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
nation under God indivisible with
 
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
everyone okay the first bill for our
 
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
consideration this morning is Senate
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 355 FN representative
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
kofalt uh I move itl on SB 355
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
FM is there a second representative mlan
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
you second representative kofalt did you
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
want to speak to your motion sure I I
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
think um you know my my concern here is
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
that we are um sort of expanding the
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
scope of recommended procedures uh for
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
newborns um it is advisory and yet
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
advisory practices um often carry a lot
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
of weight advisory practices often U
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
morph at a later date into mandatory
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
practice is um I think that this is an
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary Bill and that is why I moved
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
Barber

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
Barber
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman
 
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.509 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman
um

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
I oppose the itl I think this was an
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
entirely benign bill that recognized
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
that adding another screening procedure
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
was not appropriate and uh the
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
encouragement for education is always
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
the way that I think is the most
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to go so um I will for
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
that reason I would have preferred a
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass but here we are
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
so I am opposing the motion of itl thank
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
discussion okay I guess it's easy in
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
that regard anyway okay so the motion is
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
itl on Senate Bill 355 FN I'll ask the
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%

okay we'll reconvene at this
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
point thank you for your patience um the
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is ought to pass on
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
355 FN representative Lon you wish to
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
speak to this motion yes thank you Mr
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
chairman and I apologize not for not
 
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
being here for the previous discussion I
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
was introducing a bill bill over in
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
Senate HHS um I recognize the motivation
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
and the importance behind this bill um
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
one of the big things that we need to
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
recognize however is that the largest
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
indicator for needing a CMV test is
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
failing the hearing screening and the
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
hearing screening is not part of the
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
newborn screening that is something that
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
is done by the hospitals as good
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
practice adding something to a voluntary
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
good practice effort that's part of the
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
newborn screening system that's required
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
seems to be a little odd to me right now
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
we need to focus on the specific
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
necessary need where if there is a child
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
who a newborn who fails the hearing
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
screening twice they should be tested
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
for CMV and that should be standard
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
practice across hospitals in New
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the fact that it's not is um
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
is the problem but I think one that
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
through education even without this bill
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
we can address um the idea of trying to
 
00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
wrap in something that comes after a
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
voluntary step just seems to be um not
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
the right way to legislate and I believe
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
that that's why um had I been in the
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
room I would have moved itl because
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
while while this is an important I
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
recognize that um I'm trying to I I
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
represented one of our bills over in the
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
senate had I been here I would have made
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
that motion because while it is
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
important to understand the risks of CMV
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
there's also the risk of scaring parents
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
needlessly for a disease that is highly
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
prevalent often does not lead to
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
negative outcomes and where antiviral
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
treatment carries its own risks from
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
that treatment so the idea of telling a
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
parent well your baby has this disease
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
nothing's probably going to happen we
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
could give them medicine but that
 
00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
medicine might hurt them that gives a
 
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
parent who is anxious nervous and trying
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing for their baby one
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
more thing to worry about when that's
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
something to leave to the professionals
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
and leave to their professional judgment
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
um that's why I believe that while this
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
is a well-intentioned bill I don't think
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
this is the right solution and I I think
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
that we should look to um we should look
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
to a different approach so thank you
 
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.750 align:start position:0%
to a different approach so thank you
representative

Weber and I'm going to pick up on the um
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
point about education and just say that
 
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
I think encouraging education is a good
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
thing and we should trust both medical
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
professionals and parents but this bill
 
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
is encouraging education and I'm going
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
to vote for it thank you
 
00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:02.230 align:start position:0%

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
FNA representative Weber and I met with
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
the clerk and we will be hearing that
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
first thing tomorrow morning and
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
executing it right after because it is
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
an early Bill they're holding the
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
calendar for it and again we're up
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
U representative where Senate uh me
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
house will
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
44b I think that's the one the clerk
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
cited it's one about firefighters right
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
firefighters and cancer screenings and
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
so we're in agreement that we we will if
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
the chairman and the ranking member
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
agree we can we can execute tomorrow
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
even though it's not noticed and
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise the bill would have to be
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
withdrawn entirely and we we don't want
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%

expect we can start any discussion and
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
hold any vote the only thing that bars
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
somebody voting is they must be in the
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
room when the question is put so when we
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
get to the end of the discussion and and
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're going for a vote so we can have a
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
general discussion but no motion can be
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
made well you can you can have a motion
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
it's just I some people have the mo
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
motions first in the discuss afterwards
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
you can do it anyway around it's just if
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
somebody when when you get to the point
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
of saying the motion is ought to pass as
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
amended and ask and somebody has not
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
been and asked the clerk to call the
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
role if they walk in after that all
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%

distributed um
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
Distributing the amendment but I wanted
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%

morning my name is Douglas osterhout and
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
I am general counsel for the office of
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
professional LIC Insurance certification
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh I did craft the majority of the
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
language I believe in this amendment uh
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose behind that is um about two
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
years ago there was a study committee
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant was on that
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh who made some
 
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations about the roles and
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities between the office of
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
Professor liur and certification and the
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
boards we oversee and uh we made some
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
changes or the legislature made some
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
changes to that um as far as uh fees
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
setting Authority who issues licenses
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing it's a work in
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
progress we had a very large Bill last
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
year that was around 200 Pages parts of
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
that bill uh were or parts of the
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
language were taken out this year is
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
sort of round two of just clean up
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
making sure there's no conflicting
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
language in statute um originally this
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
fall we thought we were going to move
 
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
forward sort of with wave two of cleanup
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
then we were told no then in the spring
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
it ended up happening so my original
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
plan was to address any language that
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
conflicted with sp sp 403 with the oplc
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
statutes in the bill we did next year
 
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
since it ended up moving forward this
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
year I thought now would be the right
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
time to make sure the language in s sp43
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
does not conflict with RSA 310 and the
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
board's practice acts so basically
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's a long way of saying this is a
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
very technical Amendment it doesn't
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
change anything policy-wise and it just
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
makes sure that the language in here
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
comports with the oplc Practice Act and
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
the board's Practice Act happy to take
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
questions any representative
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you for taking the
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
question correct I think what I read in
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
here is the clarification to who issues
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
the license but the standards for the
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
license is controlled by the board so
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
the board is the one controlling the
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
requirements for a license but the
 
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
actual physical issuing of the license
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
is done by oplc not the board that is
 
00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:08.870 align:start position:0%
is done by oplc not the board that is
100%

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
100%
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
correct other
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing Oh representative
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you I'm I'm somewhat
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
concerned sure uh at the late
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
introduction of a change of this
 
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
magnitude simply because I have heard in
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
the past that there have been times
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
when the individual boards and the
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure have not
 
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.950 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure have not
been

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
entirely uh in agreement about where
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
those boundary lines are and so I'm very
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
anxious about passing this without
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
giving everybody the opportunity for a
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
real full public hearing that
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
said I do believe that the changes are
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
technical in nature and it is going to
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
another committee um so I fervently hope
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
that anybody who has concerns with it
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
will be given appropriate notice of that
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
point uh because it's it's concerning
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
that a shift like this happens without a
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
significant amount of
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
notice representative Merchant thank you
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman also thank you for taking
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
the question on line nine
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
what was the impetus behind adding
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
employed as a licensed nursing assistant
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
for one full year where did that come
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
from who who uh wanted that language
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
inserted because it goes back to what
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
represent Weber is saying are we is this
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
something that oplc is requesting or
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
something the board is requesting
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
because it's important if it's requested
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
by the board it makes sense was the
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
original Bill what
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
s okay but again go back to who was the
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
one cuz I wasn't here for the hearing
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
who was the one that that wanted it
 
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
inserted it was not the
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
oplc representative representative Weber
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
I will just say that that was in the
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill as it was sent to us from the
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
Senate so at least people had
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
notice representative TZ you had your
 
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.309 align:start position:0%
notice representative TZ you had your
hand

00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I was we're trying
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
to reconcile the amendment sections in
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment um
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
beginning where was it uh line 24 on the
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
amendment says amend uh 326 and3 as
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
inserted by section six of the bill by
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
replacing it so I just want to make sure
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
that that's not trying to replace all of
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
section six right it's just beginning on
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
line 14 of the uh second or third
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
page yeah I'm trying to understand the
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
motivation like what is that change
 
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
motivation like what is that change
pertaining

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
to having a little difficulty following
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
the bouncing ball there so if we're
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the original bill is that the
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
reference page two line 14 page two line
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
Senate you talking about the amendment
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
of The Bill I'm trying to I'm trying to
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
understand the differences here again
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
going back to the it's a lot of
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
change it's okay well my first question
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
was you're not replacing the whole
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
section six you're just replacing
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
sections so that wasn't completely clear
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
um and then trying to
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
understand where where it says uh 326
 
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.309 align:start position:0%
understand where where it says uh 326
and

00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
3 rule making there's a fair amount of
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
difference between what was originally
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
drafted and so just trying to understand
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
sorry you asked a question
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative TZ right yes yes per and
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
he's looking and trying to find the I
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure I wasn't
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
no and could I elaborate while he's
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
looking just yes representative Weber
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
finding things in the bill itself or the
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
bill as we got it from the Senate it
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
appears to me that if I look up 326
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
colon n 3 rulemaking which is
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
what um is being amended here it starts
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
with a very long list of things that are
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
going to be done or not done and that
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
list doesn't seem to be in the amendment
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
so if you could walk us very carefully
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
through that section I think it would
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
help a great deal of us and it's online
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
line 24 of the amendment but I if you
 
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
page through the bill it is section six
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
and then when you go down to 326 and
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
three Ru making it's got the same
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
caption at least yeah apologies that was
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
line 14 of Page Three not line 14 of
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
okay I've found all the language I've
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
also got notes explaining the decisions
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
that I made I'm just trying to line it
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
up with my notes so that I don't have
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
work I I think we probably should stick
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
to one one and then we'll move forward
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
with the other question
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right so if if we're looking at 326
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
and3 the rul making uh the executive
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
director in consultation within New
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire area health education centers
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
adopt rules prent to RSA
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
541a relating to the following the
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
certification is voluntary it doesn't
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
appear that there is a board tied to
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
this certification in this bill so it's
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
more of a registry so this is one of
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
those cases where it's going to work
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
more like an an Advisory Board uh or
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
other registries that we have within the
 
00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:35.829 align:start position:0%
other registries that we have within the
office

00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
and um the executive director will work
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire area health education
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
centers to adopt rules relating to the
 
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
following in the criteria and I believe
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
that is the language in the original
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill as it was
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
proposed um section A would
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
establishment and administration for a
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary program for certification of
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
community health
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
workers that stay in the amendment
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
minimum and continuing education
 
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.190 align:start position:0%
minimum and continuing education
training

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications all stayed in the bill um
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
forms procedures for the receipt review
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
and action upon
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
applications establishment of standards
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
for continuing education can I interrupt
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
you for a moment representative has a
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
point of point if I look at the bill as
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
sent To Us by the Senate that whole
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
section 326 in3 rulemaking starts the
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
executive director shall in consultation
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire area health
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
education centers adopt rules relating
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
to the following and it's got it starts
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
out the
 
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.670 align:start position:0%
out the
same

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
then I'm just trying to find out if this
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
is a ruming thing um it's more of a
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
redundancy thing it but but under the
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
original bill there's four sections and
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
then subsections and none of those
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
appear to be in the bill as you're
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
submitting it to us correct on did you
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
have additional information yes on the
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
in the original Bill lines 24 through 36
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
are removed but the rest of that R
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
making section is there and um the part
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
about administering the fees which is um
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
currently Roman 2 on page four lines 3
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
through five is gone I believe because
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's included in the new N4 um but in
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
the rul making um it it keeps lines 14
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
through 23 of the original Bill page
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
three and then it keeps lines 1 through
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
four I can I can walk you through that
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
too if you'd like so I think a walk
 
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
through would be helpful on that because
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
uh the section the the version of the
 
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
original bill that I have is not lined
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have line representative
 
00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:09.079 align:start position:0%
Merchant you wanted to speak thank you
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
as we're going through this process I go
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
back to my question I asked earlier
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
about the role of oplc versus the role
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
of aort I have a real deep concern that
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
when you talk about rule making that the
 
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
rule making is not going through the
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
Board review process this is dealing
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
with licensed nursing assistants which
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
come under the jurisdiction of the Board
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
of Nursing not OP PLC so in saying that
 
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.390 align:start position:0%
of Nursing not OP PLC so in saying that
I

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
would strongly oppose the fact that the
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
executive director who's not required
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
even work with the Board of Nursing
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
working with Healthcare educational
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
centers and on top of that when you
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
start looking at what they're going to
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
go through rulemaking it goes through
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
the requirements for that certification
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
which is the education the training
 
00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
experience that belongs under
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
professional board and not the office of
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
professional certification in my opinion
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
representative TZ yeah sorry this is
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
confusing because there's too much in
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
this huge bill this section we're
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
talking about is community health
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
workers that is not a nursing profession
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
it is a lay profession for which there's
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
been many years of work towards creating
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
a certific voluntary certification
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
process there is no entity that would be
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
the appropriate entity except now
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
figuring out that somehow sharing that
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
between DHHS
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
this the ahex who've been doing all the
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
work of the training for years and the
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
oplc um so so it's not nursing then why
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
are we calling a licensed nursing
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
assistant it's a different section of
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
chairman um my question is if there are
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
other areas where essentially lay people
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
are certified without an Advisory Board
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
in order to set standards that are in
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
vulnerable situations um with with
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
people in the state is that something
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's done in other sections of oplc or
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
is this a novel pathway do you know it's
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
rare but it's not unheard of I believe
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
opdal dispensers are a registry without
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
a board I believe there was uh there's
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation it's confusing some
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
of it happened last year this year it's
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
getting assigned to us but for uh
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
lactate Specialists and duelist would be
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
interesting I'm just going to use the
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
word thing what we oversee now with the
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
traveling nurses the companies that
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
oversee traveling nurses now have to
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
register with us there is no board so
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a common thing but it's also
 
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.109 align:start position:0%
it's not a common thing but it's also
not

00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:51.799 align:start position:0%
unique representative L um thank you and
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
as a followup um AIC
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
dispensers um dual
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
lactation Consultants all um are not
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
operating on their own they're all in
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
conjunction with other licensed
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
professionals under a board um I believe
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
correct i' have to look at the
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislation for that I we haven't
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
implemented like du and lactate
 
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:15.079 align:start position:0%
Specialists they're not with us yet so I
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
have to see how those puzzle pieces fit
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay but in their practice they are and
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
then it would be the traveling nurse
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
associations not the nurses which
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
themselves are licensed correct so this
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
idea of having somebody go into
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's home
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's not directly overseen by somebody
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
and providing Health Care is uh is a
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
step outside of what we' already have
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
established even if we are working
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
towards it in other areas no it's it's a
 
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.589 align:start position:0%
towards it in other areas no it's it's a
new

00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
section I think the closest comparison
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
here is probably alal
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
dispensers thank you yeah
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so I believe you were going through
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
the bill and and trying to clarify some
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
things before we got into some questions
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
but if you want to resumed sure uh so
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
I'm on page three of the bill as amended
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
by the Senate line 24 so uh it would be
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
326 and three and it's just Roman
 
00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:06.069 align:start position:0%
326 and three and it's just Roman
numeral

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
1B uh forms and procedures for the
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
receipt review and action upon
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
applications for initial community
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
health workers Etc uh this Authority is
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
already granted in proposed 326
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
n31a which requires the executive
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
director to adopt rules for the
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
establishment and administration of a
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary program so
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
believ the language just to be redundant
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
so I just removed it um section c right
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
below that establishment of standards
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
for continuing education and other
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
requirements uh the executive director
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
has regulatory Authority Under proposed
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
RSA 326 and3 the executive director is
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
required to consult with the New
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire area health education centers
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
pursuant to proposed 326 N3 Roman
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
numeral one my suggestion would be to
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
add the commissioner to to that list so
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
the Ed consults with the education
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
centers and commissioner that's what I
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
wrote in my uh draft I sent with to
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald that's a policy
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
decision just a recommendation um strike
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
all of D I suggested because Ru making
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
Authority for D already exists in RSA
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
310 colon 6 Roman numeral
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
2 uh the E the determination assessment
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
and collection of certification fees Etc
 
00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:30.799 align:start position:0%
r exists in RSA 310 colon 6 Roman
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
numerals 1 and
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
two and F other well I didn't change
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
that I just changed commissioner to
 
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
executive director so basically it was
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
just to remove any redundancy in the
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
statute where the rulemaking authority
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
are already exists within the office in
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
3106 so that was my goal there um one of
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
the things we're up against and the
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
reason we have to do
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
multiple Omnibus bills is whenever we
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
make or grant that same Authority in one
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
place if we put it in two or three
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
places we have to change all of the the
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
purpose of that consolidation in 310 was
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
to avoid that
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
course okay any other discussion on the
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Nagel did did
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
you want me what's an Opthalmic
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
dispenser they just Opthalmic I don't
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I believe it's um is it contact
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
lenses I'm not entirely sure I I deal on
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
the administrative side not the scope of
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
practice side so I don't really have
 
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.870 align:start position:0%
practice side so I don't really have
useful

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
useful
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
information Bill well it is in the sense
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
that we're comparing the right but it's
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
not part of Bill representative Shapiro
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
so in regard to your initial comments
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
aligning this bill with changes that are
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
coming would it be safe to say
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
that across
 
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
oplc um the
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
boards will will not issue licenses and
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
certifications it will be oplc that's
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
the that's the technical that's correct
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay and also follow
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
um in regard to representative
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
Merchant's question before about um line
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
nine um letter B has employed as a
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant for one year
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
I think we heard during the hearing that
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
that makes a change from two years which
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
is not in statute but is in rules so
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of Bringing Down the standard
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
so that more people can get um this
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
ability to provide a medication
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for this
 
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
gentleman I'm seeing none okay thank
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
you any other discussion on the
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
H seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
a roll motion is ought to pass on
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
another motion representative poal did
 
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
you have a motion uh yes I move itl on
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 403 second representative
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
Leon seconds the motion do you wish to
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
representative yes um I am very
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
concerned with the creation of a uh
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
a a new um lenser position community
 
00:56:01.599 --> 00:56:02.470 align:start position:0%
a a new um lenser position community
health

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
workers um I'm concerned especially
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
about some of the the definitions
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
offered here um including for
 
00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.349 align:start position:0%
offered here um including for
example

00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
um in providing informal and
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
motivational counseling so informal uh
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry motivational counseling I
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
think I understand informal
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
counseling um
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
I think is very poorly defined there is
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
another provision in this that says they
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
shall not perform any any duties that
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
are um performed by somebody who would
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
require other certifications or
 
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
licenses um so I think this is an
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily fuzzy definition um on
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
line 28 it says that community health
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
workers would provide other services as
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
defined by uh
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
rulemaking um that seems to me to be a
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
wide open door so while I think we heard
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
from some people who are community
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
health workers that they are very
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
committed to their jobs they feel like
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're making a
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
difference um I guess I would I would
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
ask the question um how do we know that
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
this is truly effective um how far will
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
the government reach into people's lives
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
we heard one person um attest to the
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
fact that uh she was helping people with
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
things like um advising them to tape
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
down a carpet so they don't trip over it
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
um and just as importantly perhaps how
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
far will government reach into people's
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
pockets because somebody has to pay for
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
this and this bill creates a
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
reimbursement mechanism um in which uh
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
in which we would be paying for people
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
whose responsibilities I believe are um
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily uh vaguely defined open
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
to expansion through
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
rulem and um and I I just think that
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
this is a bad precedent to set thank you
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative Leon did you want to
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
speak to you a second or um yes Mr
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much um so this
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
is an area where we need to look at what
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing what powers we're giving and
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
most importantly what we're making the
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
public see when they see the
 
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.150 align:start position:0%
public see when they see the
certification

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
um with this certification from the
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
state and the ability to Bill people
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
were are going to expect a lot out of
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
these community health workers they're
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
going to expect that they're going to be
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
able do a lot of things to help them out
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
um quite frankly when we had involvement
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
with them with family members in
 
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
California we expected a lot out of them
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
we expected too much um even though it
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
was a regulated profession there in
 
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
California um they did not add to the
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
situation and they delayed the ability
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
to get more appropriate care for a loved
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
one um because there was an expectation
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
that they were providing care and help
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
that they were not um I'm very concerned
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
for our elderly residents if they think
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
that this is somebody who's going to
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
come in and be able to do things that um
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
really should be in a licensed regulated
 
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
Health worker especially in their home
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
especially with vulnerable populations
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
and um further when we look at this we
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
see that this is creating something
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
that's on par with opthamol dispensing
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
which is the design verification and
 
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:20.839 align:start position:0%
delivery to the intended wearer of
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
lenses frames and other specially
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
fabricated optical devices based on a
 
00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:26.630 align:start position:0%
fabricated optical devices based on a
prescription

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
that's a big jump going from the person
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
which is a very important skill to make
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
sure that somebody's glasses are correct
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
and their contact lenses are correct to
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
being that trusted person in somebody's
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
home that they rely on as their contact
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
to the health system um I think that
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
this is this is something that will
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
touch our most vulnerable people and I
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that moving through with this
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
where we even have questions on how to
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
regulate it how to deal with it is too
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
too much um there had been a question of
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
in my mind should we interim study this
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
so we can work through it but this is
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
such a large and complex thing that it
 
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
would be even hard for this committee to
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
meet in um the remaining time and in the
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
fall in order to come with an approach I
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
think we'd be doing it a disservice to
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
try and do this I think that it's
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
something that we need uh people to work
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the legislative process and
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
try and understand this better get
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
groups together try and figure out
 
01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
specifically what's been needed look to
 
01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:27.799 align:start position:0%
what's worked in other states look to
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
how people in California have been
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
misled because they thought they were
 
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
getting a health worker but they weren't
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we don't repeat the
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
stakes the mistakes of other states so
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
while I'm very compassionate to the idea
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
that and the recognition that community
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
health workers do do a lot of good um I
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
think that this
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
professionalization without the
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
underpinnings does a disservice overall
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to I don't want to
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
demean anything that people in the
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
community health workers are doing I
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we're not
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
putting false hope to our vulnerable
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
people thank you other discussion
 
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.630 align:start position:0%
people thank you other discussion
representative

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair I do concern
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
myself with one aspect that maybe was
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
talked about with the hearing I
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
apologize to the Comm committee for not
 
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.789 align:start position:0%
apologize to the Comm committee for not
being

01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
here we talked about in Senate Bill 495
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of abuse so I think there's
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
two parts to it that I concern myself
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
one is the competency of the person
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
doing it the other thing is ensuring
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
that the people that they're providing
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
the service to are not being abused
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
financially physically or otherwise and
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's one of the concerns I
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
have here is that if we do go forward
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary which makes sense but I
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
don't want that certification to be held
 
01:01:44.349 --> 01:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
up to a patient or to somebody else
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
thinking that's a gold seal of approval
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
and they let the guard down and all of a
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
sudden we open them up the possibility
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
of abuse again Financial physical or
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise so that's one of Deep concerns
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
I have the way this bill's
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
written representative Palmer you had
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.119 --> 01:02:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
um so I have representative T is next
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
first oh okay um I have a couple of
 
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
issues one um I really don't like the
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
fact that so much is crammed into one
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill because there are other parts of
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
this bill that I think are extremely
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
important though I think um
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
the commission on Primary Care was
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
covered in HB 169 and I'm hoping that
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
that will go through regardless the
 
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
other one that um is really important is
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
the um nurse Practice Act statute trying
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
to get more coverage for
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
everything um as far as the community
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
health workers I I mean I agree that
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is hard to understand I would
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
just say that those people people have
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
existed um paid for by grants and other
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
institutions and are a really key part
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
of delivering healthc care well and we
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
somehow need to figure that piece out
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
and get it covered because it does in
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
the long run um make a big difference in
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
whether patients who are being
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
discharged from the hospital or just
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
have complex um medical problems
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
actually get the care that they need to
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
get um at
 
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
home but it's
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
problematic thank you representative T
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
sorry about
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman so community
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
health workers uh as representative
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
Palmer stated exist they've been with us
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
well they're internationally they exist
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
and are relied upon in the US at least
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for at least 15 or 20
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
years we've had Community Health worker
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
initiatives the problem has been they're
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
you know not sustained if they're Grant
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
funded programmatically here there
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
whatever um anatomic head of the
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester Health Department spoke a few
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
years ago and said we need an army of
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
community health workers to meet the
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
needs that our communities currently
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
have community health workers are lay
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
community members they are trusted
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
members of their Community that's why
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
they're effective it has nothing to do
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
with clinical knowledge they do not
 
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
pretend to be clinical providers what
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
they do is they connect people to
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
resources they help people identify
 
01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
where to go for help how to get
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
connected um they meet people where they
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
are in community
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
maybe they sometimes go into the home
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
but it is a profession there are
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards and what this
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
certification process does is just do
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
what many Most states have done across
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
the country and it has been written with
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
the best practices recognized and
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
recommended from across the country
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
which is that it be voluntary and um
 
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
that there be an advisory entity and the
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
only thing that has to do with the opic
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
thing is the fact is is nothing except
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that they have some kind of
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
advisory structure that would mirror
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed here and so um I
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
the um Association for state and
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
territorial Health officials and many
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
other people have demonstrated that the
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
return on investment is easily at least
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
3 to one if not 15 to one there are low
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
wage workers that make a huge difference
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
in plugging the gaps in the health
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
system which we have all collectively
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
agreed is very problematic and um I know
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
of no instances of any chws being
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
anything but incredibly welcome and
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
valued by patients and community and
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
family members and would strongly urge
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we pass what has been worked on for
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
a very long time for by a very broad
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
range of stakeholders from all over the
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
state from the North Country to um you
 
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
know Health Providers to community
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
organizations to Public Health
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
departments um so that this can be a
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
sustained uh Workforce that is valued as
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
they you know should
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
be thank you representative Weber and
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um I agree with everything
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
that representative TZ said um I have a
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
couple of well I want to
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
emphasize that comparing this to a
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
different profession that is equally not
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
supervised by a board is a false
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
equivalent because they're just
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
different one of these things is not
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
like the other um I also want
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
to remind people that what we heard at
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
the hearing or what I thought I heard at
 
01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:35.799 align:start position:0%
the hearing was the issue of keeping
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
people in this profession which is very
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
helpful and very useful and often
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's a grant and they have a job for
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
a year or two years and then the grant
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
ends the job ends the help ends so a
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
patient who has um had a good
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
relationship with the carer loses that
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
carer and um in addition the carer may
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
go somewhere else and may not have this
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
you know they may work at a a different
 
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
employment altogether and we lose that
 
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
caring and expertise so that was a
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
problem that led to this I also want to
 
01:07:15.559 --> 01:07:17.950 align:start position:0%
problem that led to this I also want to
caution

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
caution
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
about relying on our own individual
 
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.630 align:start position:0%
about relying on our own individual
family

01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
situations uh to make
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
change to make U policy across the board
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
because um there are all kinds of
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
different situations in all kinds of
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
different states uh the one that my
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
family went through was an elderly Aunt
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
of mine who did not live in the same
 
01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
state I did and was
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
unwilling uh and and
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
was well she just didn't live in the
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
same state that I did and uh was
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
horribly taken advantage of by
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
completely unregulated carers uh with
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
nobody looking over the shoulder or
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
taking into account what might have
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
happened at another house and therefore
 
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't go to the next house in any
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
case I think that regulation in this
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
case is better than non-regulation so I
 
01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
will be opposing the
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
itl thank you representative Lon um
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um and thank you
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
for the these different statements um
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
first I wanted to key on to
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
representative TZ speaking to um
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
community health workers as trusted
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
community members um I think that that's
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
very important but we also need to
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
understand some of those consequences of
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
trust and I want to key into what
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant said um so I'm
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee on Alzheimer's
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
disease and other related dementia at
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
the last meeting the New Hampshire elder
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
abuse and financial exploitation unit
 
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office gave
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
a presentation um in which you know you
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
know one in 10 older vict older adults
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
are victimized in each year with only
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
one in 24 reported um 60% of abuse and
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
neglect comes at the hands of family
 
01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
members but where does that other 40%
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
come from caregiver neglect whether it's
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
family or not is the most common form of
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
neglect and only one in7 cases of
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
caregiver neglect are
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
reported so there is harm that is
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
happening in the state they're following
 
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
up on those resources we have elder
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
abuse and financial exploitation we have
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
a daughter-in-law that stole
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
$102,000 from a a family member with
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
with um early onset dementia and she was
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
convicted and sentenced we had a son
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
that sold
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
$325,000 from a parent that had lack
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
capacity because they had dementia with
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's Tye and they spent 5 to 10
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
years in the state prison we had a
 
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
brother and sister-in-law that stole
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
$90,000 from a woman who had dementia
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
and at the time of the trial she was
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
deceased and those defendants spent a
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
year in the New Hampshire state prison
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
um this is something that is a concern
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
and is being worked on in the Attorney
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
General's office to make sure that we
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
are protecting our vulnerable adults um
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
our vulnerable senior citizens and given
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the reporting rate is so low and
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
given the rate the fact that we have
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
these Community workers already here
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
which is good but adding a whole another
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
layer to it by making it an
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
institutionalized process where um
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
people will say great we have this
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
they're licensed by the state I can
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
trust them that we already have
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
significant issues and I'm just
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about what's going to happen
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
to our elderly Granite Staters because
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
the information from the Attorney
 
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
General's office says that it is a
 
01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.310 align:start position:0%
General's office says that it is a
problem

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
here okay any other representative
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes I'm going to vote against
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
itl um and I think this is an initiative
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
that's well worth us pursuing um it
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
speaks to two um issues that are brought
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
up here all the time time one is
 
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.470 align:start position:0%
up here all the time time one is
Workforce

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.070 align:start position:0%
Workforce
shortage

01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
um three issues one is the general
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
dysfunction second one is the general
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
dysfunction of our
 
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
um provision of Medical Care in the
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
state and in the country and third the
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
issue of trust and I would just like to
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
distinguish you know my feeling about
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of trust from um the previous
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
speaker which is um there's been a lot
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
of talk about the public not trusting
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
the Health Care system in general and
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
not trust and we know there's been a lot
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
of um you know there's been a lot of
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
issues that that have come down from
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
covid which has um eroded trust in the
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
Health Care System um whether I think it
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
should or not it clearly has and I think
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the key aspect of the community
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
health workers is that there are people
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
who are in People's Community who people
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
can relate to um who may speak the same
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
language as them and I think this will
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
be an e this will be go a long way in
 
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.270 align:start position:0%
be an e this will be go a long way in
terms

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
of increasing the trust between the
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
Health Care System overall and
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
individuals who are being served and I
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
do acknowledge that people can be taken
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
advantage of and
 
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
um they can be taken advantage of by
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
physicians who are licensed by the board
 
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
they can be taken advantage of by um
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
relatives um
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
by the mailman who delivers mail so I
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
um I think that the the advantages to
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
having people who people can really
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
relate to helping them with everyday
 
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
me trumps the danger which is already
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
which is already clearly there so I will
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
vote against itl and vote for hopefully
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
vote for or to pass on this bill
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative TZ did you you started to
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
put your microphone on but uh any other
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh oh yes representative
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you it's it's a it's nice
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to push the red button here
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
um as you know I've been away for a
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of time and what you can
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
really do thank you but what you really
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
do is you notice in maybe you're a bit
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
more heightened uh awareness to what is
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
said um and I first came across
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
community health workers almost a decade
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
ago up in Plymouth New Hampshire and it
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
was impressive to me how they work
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
within the community they have the trust
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
of the community and during that past 10
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
years I've also seen the decline of the
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
the the trust necessarily in healthc
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
care providers so I've seen this group
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
of community healthcare workers have a
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
trust you know quotient go up while
 
01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers has gone down to
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
some degree whether I agree with that or
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
not is another story altogether but what
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
I did hear when this bill was introduced
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh over the past couple of weeks was the
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
concepts of the social determinance of
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
health so what these people are doing
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're not going into your house and
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
prescribing medication they're making
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
sure that your electricity bill was paid
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
so that your insulin in the refrigerator
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
is on um they're arranging rides to you
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
know to get to appointments they are uh
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
basically helping with housing issues
 
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
they are helping with medication issues
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
they helping with getting a prescription
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
from CVS and I also heard a primary care
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
provider saying we need help and so if
 
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
there's any lack of trust in the primary
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
care providers offices in large part
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
it's because they can't get access to
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
these people whereas they can get access
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
to a community health worker so these
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
people need help it keeps them out of
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
their doctor's office it keeps them out
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the hospital which you know having
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
recently been there is very expensive
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
care um and so what I would say is that
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes the bill has a lot of you know
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
entanglements to it I appreciate the
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that was made because I think
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
that that does help it quite a bit um
 
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
but what I'm saying this is basically is
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
my experience with the um uh listening
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
and what I hear but also more
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
importantly what I saw with the
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
community health workers at a tertiary
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
Care Medical Center you know sometimes
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
you don't get into the weeds with what
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
happens at home but having worked at a
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
community hospital for the past 10 years
 
01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:41.719 align:start position:0%
of my career you really become aware of
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
the value of the community health worker
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
and what they do to a family and what
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
they do for a patient so I will vote
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
against the itl I understand that the
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
bill may have a lot of complicating
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
factors to it but much of it I agree
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
with and the amendment only makes it
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
better so I will vote for hopefully what
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
will be an OTP um motion after this one
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
is thank you thank you any other
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
Nagel this is probably more of a comment
 
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
than anything but I just find this bill
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a sad statement of modern
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
society I mean my mother used to do this
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
when we were kids you know we lived in
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
ethnic and you know um neighborhoods and
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
churches and people just reached out and
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
made sure that you you had what you
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
needed you know you could recognize in a
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
second when somebody needed something
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is doesn't happen like it
 
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
used to and it makes all this almost a
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
necessity which I think is sad but it's
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
real and um I do have a gentleman in our
 
01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
um nonprofit that does this he saved a
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
lot of people's lives and um he um you
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
know a guy walks on water to me um
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
totally uncertified really probably
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing what he's doing so
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
something that will Empower him means a
 
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
lot to me
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Merchant thank you
 
01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:05.149 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Merchant thank you
Mr

01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
chair I want to follow up on what Dr
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
Nel's talking about one of the concerns
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
I have also even though this is
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary where it leads
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
to I want to be sure that people who
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
work in those Arenas that Dr Nel or
 
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
represent Nel talked about whether it be
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
from the church the community itself and
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
we don't somehow
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
inadvertently create a problem where
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
they can't do their job or help somebody
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
out because they don't have the
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
certification even though it's co
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
voluntary so then all of a sudden people
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
looking for and asking are you Vol are
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
you certified and the answer will
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
probably be no because it's not required
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
so therefore is the patient in the
 
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
quandry saying oh you're not competent
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
to do what you're doing so I really
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
wrestle with that in the marketplace and
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
saying it's one of those things where
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
you got the seal of approval that
 
01:17:58.510 --> 01:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's looking for which is probably
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
not needed completely yet the patient's
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
looking at it and saying they're in a
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
quandry because at that point in time
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for the seal of approval yet
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have it but you can still do a
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
lot for me you come from the church you
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
come from other places if you will and
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things looking for
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
within the realm of the patients
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
particularly elderly patients they're
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
confused they need to have the ability
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
to get the assistance and help that they
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
need from trusted sources and not just
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
rely upon certification that's also in
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the ISU have with using
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
it as a shield to somebody who wants to
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
abuse an LLY patient physically or
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
financially so in saying that I will
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
support the
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
ideal representative TZ yeah thank
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
you I want to make it really clear these
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
are not caregivers these are not uh you
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a chw and a longitudinal
 
01:18:54.159 --> 01:18:55.270 align:start position:0%
don't have a chw and a longitudinal
relationship

01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
unless there's something else um going
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
on um there are two really
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
wellestablished Community Health worker
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
training programs that were modeled
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
after very long-standing effective
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
Community Health worker training
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
programs in other states um those um
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of people who've gone
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
through the programs they get trained
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they get hired for a job and then
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
the funding runs out and then they can't
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
continue in that professional role which
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
is really really valued it is at the
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
doctor's office maybe realize the
 
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
primary reason a patient is struggling
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
is because of their food insecurity but
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
the doctor's office is not equipped to
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
address that but maybe they then make a
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
call to a community agency or maybe they
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
have a chw in the office or a
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
partnership so that somehow or other
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
someone in this role whether or not
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
they're doesn't matter where they're
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
stationed like who they're who's giving
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
them their paycheck but somewh how or
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
other someone who's whose expertise is
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
to help address their primary needs get
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
them connected to resource es so they
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
can be um healthier uh is Avail is you
 
01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
know their being available is really
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
valuable um and there's something else
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
you said that slipped my mind um and and
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
and and uh there are you know there's a
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
whole set of um work that's been done
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
across the country to have established
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
competencies to have you know
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
recognized uh qualifications and so the
 
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
reason this is voluntary is because our
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
people have been doing this work for 20
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
years and um we let the chws tell us
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not they wanted to move
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
forward with certification over the last
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
at least 5 years there are people for
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
whom saying well you have to be
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
certified maybe for certain kinds of
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
compensation and so that's why we're
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
ending up with the bill that is
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
presenting this as an Avenue for certain
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
things like maybe U reimbursement by
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
certain mechanisms uh but the
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
certification in and of itself isn't
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to change someone's
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
rate of pay right it'll just be an
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
additional credential but some people
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
have 20 years of experience and and
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
Goodwill that they've garnered and
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
that's enough of a credential so that is
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
why it's voluntary and the kinds of
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
concerns that are being raised are are
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
handled by other presses like you get
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
other kinds of training if you're
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
working with Elders or working out of a
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
Elder Social Service Agency right
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
there's additional competencies and
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
education and credentials that can be
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
provided representative Weber thank you
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
and I just I just come back to two
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
fundamental principles because I hear
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
the concern that everybody has for for
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
elders and not being um taken advantage
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
of and those are all very real and very
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
concerning issues that happen right now
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
and so it seems to me that establishing
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
more accountability
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
not leaving things the way they are is a
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
good thing for number one and number two
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
encouraging this Workforce which we all
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
agree is
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
necessary uh is another good thing and
 
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm going to vote against the
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
itl thank you representative Shapero yes
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
just in in regard to um
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for people to take
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of other people I think um yes
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
these people would not be attached to a
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
board and maybe at some point that would
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
be a good idea um
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
but from the discussion it sounds almost
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
like we're assuming that these people
 
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
will be operating as independent agents
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
and going into people's homes but
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
there'll be other guard rails all these
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
people will be working for organizations
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
um that have
 
01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
um you know that have um policies that
 
01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:01.750 align:start position:0%
um you know that have um policies that
have

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
supervision people will be working as
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
parts of teams so I think that while I
 
01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
understand the the concern about people
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of other people which
 
01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
obviously um we heard a lot of examples
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
of how that happens with a variety of
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
people um it's not like these people
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
will be independent agents going into
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
people's homes um free to take advantage
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
of people they'll be working um under
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
supervision as part of an
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
organization representative Lon um thank
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I just wanted to
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
bring up two things um my question would
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
be whether these groups that they're
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
working for are regulated by the state
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
because we ran into the challenge with
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
the sober homes having people that had
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
an administrative role not having
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
accountability for what was done so if
 
01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:53.639 align:start position:0%
there's not similar accountability
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
through whoever is employing the
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
community health workers we're just
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
creating another area where people think
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
that there are safeguards in place that
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
may not exist um the other is there's
 
01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
confusion over this representative TZ
 
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
seems is a subject matter expert in this
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned and she had
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
stated that this is not longitudinal
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
care yet representative Weber was
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the importance of of uh
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
people in this role continuing to see
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
individuals that they already have a
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
relationship with I know that it can
 
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
have different situations and different
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
scenarios but um my question too is is
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
we want to encourage people to be
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
involved in the healthcare Workforce
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a reason that as a grant
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
goes away we bring people into into
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
stepping up another level of care so
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
that they can they can join the
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%
workforce um and provide even greater
 
01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:41.719 align:start position:0%
levels of care if they're so interested
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
so I I think that while it's well
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
intentioned I just don't think that's
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
this is ready for prime time at all
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
thank you all right we've covered it
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
pretty well anybody got anything
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
new seeing seeing no one else um motion
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
is um in expedient to legislate on

01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:01.390 align:start position:0%
my piles here for a
moment

01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%

the adoption of amendment 2024 1563 H
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to speak to that if I might
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
is there a second to the motion second
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative not oh representative uh
 
01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant I'm sorry seconds everybody's
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
hand went up at once representative
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
rubia recognize to speak to your motion
 
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:51.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
um you remember when this bill came to
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
us it had a list of about five things
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
and it said in the text that all five of
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
them had to be present uh for Medicaid
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to happen so um I made
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
several changes mostly I kept those
 
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
things the same but I rearranged the
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
wording uh the
 
01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.590 align:start position:0%
wording uh the
first

01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
the first change that I made to what was
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
given to us comes on line
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
1112 and I made it specific that
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
providers shall be me eligible for
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement when the provider
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
has documented the following because I
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
know there were concerns about
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
documentation and I didn't want to make
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
that too uh narrow and I certainly know
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid has a lot of documentation
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
anyway but I want to be sure it is docu
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
mented so that's just in there so on
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
line 13 it's required that the response
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
originated through an emergency call
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
which is a little broader than 911 but
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
still keeps the issue of this is not in
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
connection with a transport between
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
facilities or something it's an
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
emergency call um in all cases the
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
patient has to have consented to
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
evaluation and treatment and then one of
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
the following only one one of the
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
following three things has to
 
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
happen either a after the evaluation and
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
when indicated treatment the paramedic
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
or EMT and the patient agrees there's no
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
need for transportation that's number
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
one and in all of these cases I mean
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
Services have to be rendered because you
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
can't bill for them unless services are
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
rendered so it doesn't say that again
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
and again but that's a requirement
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's already required by Medicaid
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
secondly the patient does not estest and
 
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
actually refuse actively refuses
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
transport to an emergency room for
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
evaluation so that would be when the
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
patient and the uh EMT disagree on the
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
need for transport but the patient has a
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
right not to be transported it doesn't
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
mean they haven't been evaluated and
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
treated um and see the patient this is a
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
combination of two in the original Bill
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
and it says the patient is stable for
 
01:32:24.030 --> 01:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
referral to uh physician other community
 
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
source and the patient has the ability
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
including mental capacity and
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
transportation assist resources to
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
obtain assistance and medically
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
indicated followup so um you know they
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
have a plan and the plan is capable of
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
being followed out um so one of those
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
three a b or c has to happen and then we
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
had the issue of reimbursement after um
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
assistance had treatment had been given
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
but was unsuccessful uccessful and the
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
patient did not U was not resuscitated
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
so uh the last part says they shall
 
01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
providers shall also be eligible for
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement when the provider
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
has documented that the response
 
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
originated through an emergency call
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
resuscitation efforts were terminated
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
and the patient is deceased because you
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
can't have any consent under those under
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
those conditions so I hope that that
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
will meet with your approval thank
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant thank you
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
represent Weber uh thank you Mr chair in
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
regards to resusitation efforts were
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
terminated so it's just basically at
 
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
that point in time the efforts to
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
resuscitate somebody could be terminated
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
because they were resuscitated but the
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
patient didn't become deceased is that
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
when I'm reading it be clear well it
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
says when the provider has documented
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
first of all the response originated
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
through an emergency
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
call resuscitation efforts were
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
terminated and the patient is deceased
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
is it all three of those yeah I would
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
think so and
 
01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.390 align:start position:0%
think so and
certainly

01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
unless I'm remembering
 
01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.430 align:start position:0%
unless I'm remembering
[Music]

01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
certain issues with people with DNR at
 
01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
home orders and I can't remember the
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
name for that
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
but my
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
understanding is that unless there is if
 
01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
there is a need for
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
resuscitation the EMTs will do that
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
unless there is some kind of P it's a
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
pulst or other order saying that they're
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
not going to thank
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
you other disc representative
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
kofo um thank you so I I guess
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just wondering if a a technical
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment might be required ired
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
um many many years ago I actually was a
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
certified EMT in Massachusetts and
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
recall being called to a uh a home where
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
the patient was deceased when we
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
arrived um I think that this is actually
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
a fairly common scenario and so um my
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not we need to
 
01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
adjust the
 
01:35:19.239 --> 01:35:22.270 align:start position:0%
adjust the
language

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
um to to say if if resuscitation was
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
terminated if initiated um again this I
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
may be nitpicking here but I would think
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
that if if emergency services are called
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
to respond um and the idea is that they
 
01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
ought to be reimbursed for that whether
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
the patient is deceased when they arrive
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
or sometime shortly after they arrive uh
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
should not affect the material outcome
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
I can't guarantee it because what I did
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
was I took two Clauses which were
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
dangling off of other things and put
 
01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.149 align:start position:0%
dangling off of other things and put
them

01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
together uh but I
 
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
think I mean first of all if you walk in
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
and you have determined that the patient
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
is deceased and that resuscitation
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
efforts are not going to be
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
availing under whatever those
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances are so I'm not going to
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
speculate then you haven't started
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
treatment and um there may have been an
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh but I'm pretty sure that
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
the underlying Medicaid regulations
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
about what you can bill for will cover
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
this but I can't promise that um and if
 
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to come up with a floor
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment where the drafting was more
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
Artful I certainly would be glad to at
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
least consider that
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
um but I am very much
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
hoping that
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
we not in this case make the perfect the
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
enemy of the good because it is a big
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
problem that this will help a lot and we
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
can certainly revisit it as soon as next
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
year other
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Seth King and
 
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
then representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to to thank uh
 
01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for um I think
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
vastly improving the logic of the code
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
here it scratches that itch of mine so
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's very nice um but I do think um
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative Kofa brings up a good
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
point in that there are a lot of people
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
um who will be resuscitated um right
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
then and there and still actively refuse
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
to go to a hospital that does happen
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
quite a bit my understanding is
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
especially with people that overdose
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go to a hospital so
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
that could that could um Encompass quite
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
a few people something to think about
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and in that case um
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
they the people who did the
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
resuscitation would be compensated
 
01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:08.360 align:start position:0%
because you're not under that last piece
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make it clear that in
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
that case they would receive you know
 
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
they can bill for the um treatment that
 
01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.229 align:start position:0%
they can bill for the um treatment that
they

01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
gave and that's
 
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
scenario um B
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's covered here representative
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
Murphy no I was thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
was just going to say that you know in
 
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.149 align:start position:0%
was just going to say that you know in
section

01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
A you know to representative kof's
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
question you know if um there's an
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation and the patient is deceased
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
then they should be compensated for that
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
so basically you know they have done an
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation it's not an easy thing always
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
to determine you know deceased versus
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
not but if they did an evaluation and
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
the patient is Cold Stone dead then and
 
01:38:55.149 --> 01:38:55.159 align:start position:0%
that's an evaluation that they've done
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
and should be compensated for that so I
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
would hope that that is addressed in
 
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:03.430 align:start position:0%
would hope that that is addressed in
that

01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
language representative kofalt so I I
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
think we have um there there's
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient comment at this point that
 
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
there at Le is at least some legislative
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
intent in that direction
 
01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
um perhaps I will reach out um in the
 
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
coming week or so to somebody in in the
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
department to determine whether or not
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
this would be reimbursable given the
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
current language and then if anybody is
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
interested in uh potentially bringing a
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment with me uh to address
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
that I would invite you to do so thank
 
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
discussion taking no other discussion so
 
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:47.960 align:start position:0%

representative Weber I was going to say
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
I would ask that we put it on the
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
consent calendar with the understanding
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
that if an amendment is to be
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
forthcoming I if if if an amendment
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
actually is there uh I would be glad to
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
join with others and making up the 10
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
people to take it off consent um it has
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
a million dollar I'm sorry I do that all
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
the time representative Weber so you
 
01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:28.599 align:start position:0%

01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
doing it representative Weber make me
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
feel better uh do you have a motion
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh well I guess I
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
do I would like to move a to passes
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
amended okay is there a second
 
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
representative not up from
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
seconds uh any other discussion do you
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to that motion
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber or no thank you I I
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
think we've we've done that enough any
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
other discussion on this motion
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative Paz off and then
 
01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
King I I like the intent of this bill to
 
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
reimburse for unfunded uh mandates but I
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
think it goes from the wrong direction
 
01:42:21.589 --> 01:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
we need to which uh which those unfunded
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
mandates and
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
um uh as as we just heard like we are
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
not clear what exactly this bill is a
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
man that will be covering so it's hard
 
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
to evaluate uh how expensive it will be
 
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
and it looks like it will be expensive
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh and we don't know how much it will
 
01:42:49.109 --> 01:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
potentially save so I think it's not
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time so even though I
 
01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.070 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time so even though I
like

01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
intent I will vote no thank you
 
01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
chair so I'm going to be reluctantly
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
voting no on this bill um I understand
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
all the reasons why somebody would vote
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
for this bill I think there's a lot of
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
um good cases to be made for it but my
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
issue um is a little different um and
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
that is that we heard in testimony that
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
um several states have already done this
 
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
and the way I see it is that when it
 
01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
comes to grabbing for federal dollars
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like playing Hungry Hungry
 
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
Hippos that if you decide to be a state
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
that doesn't want to participate in the
 
01:43:32.669 --> 01:43:32.679 align:start position:0%
game you're going to lose all the
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
marbles and the other states that do
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
participate will get those federal
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
dollars so it really is only a matter of
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
time before all the states join on and
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
do this um but the problem I have is
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
that I think a lot of people don't
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
really realize how it's being paid for
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
we say oh well instead of paying it for
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
local taxes we're paying it with federal
 
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
taxes but in reality we're not paying it
 
01:43:55.709 --> 01:43:55.719 align:start position:0%
in federal taxes because most people
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
don't understand that 2third of all the
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
dollars in existence are outside of the
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
United States and when the federal
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
government runs a deficit they print
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
dollars out of thin air to pay for these
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
bills so what we're effectively doing is
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
we are inflating the currency we're
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
destroying the value of it and people
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
that live in countries all around the
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
world including poor people they're
 
01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
seeing the value of the dollars that
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
they hold lose value and so what we're
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
really doing is we are charging people
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
in poor countries to pay for the welfare
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
in a rich country and I think that is
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
totally immoral I don't support it I
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
understand why it all makes sense on
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
paper um and I don't think there's
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
anything I can do to stop it because our
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
appetite for federal dollars is
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
insatiable um that being said um I don't
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
feel like talking about this on the
 
01:44:43.149 --> 01:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
house floor so if it I I'm willing to do
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
consent calendar I'm not terribly
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill it's it's small
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
potatoes compared to all the things we
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
blow our money on but it's it's the
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
principle that really bothers me thank
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
you representative mlan and then
 
01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.709 align:start position:0%
you representative mlan and then
representative

01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant yeah uh yeah thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think it's immoral to to
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
mandate somebody come out and provide a
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
service and not pay them so I I think
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
that you know they're providing a
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
valuable service they need to be
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
compensated for that it's not right that
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
you mandate somebody to do something and
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
that you not compensate them and I
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
understand the concern about the dollars
 
01:45:19.149 --> 01:45:19.159 align:start position:0%
but there was also some discussion in
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
the work session where another benefit
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
of this is the opportunity to go out
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
there do an assessment render immediate
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
care and keep people in their home and
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
maybe prevent them having to go to the
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
hospital in the first place so I think
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
um you know uh we're going to have two
 
01:45:35.950 --> 01:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
bites at the Apple because the house
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill passed and so I'm going to be
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
supporting the Bill thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant then
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
chair following up on representative
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
Clan's comments um I do concur to have
 
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
something mandated and not pay for it is
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate um that's
 
01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
fundamentally concern number two is that
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
when it's unfunded and it's a mandate it
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
falls down to the local property
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and we have property taxpayers
 
01:46:06.669 --> 01:46:06.679 align:start position:0%
are struggling in our state to continue
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
to downshift responsibility from the
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
state who mandates this or the federal
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
government that mandates it and not
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
support a local property tax base I
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
think is
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
unconscionable representative
 
01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
chair I've never never played Hungry
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
Hippos so um but I'd be glad to try it
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
if you wrote it in
 
01:46:34.589 --> 01:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
um I I appreciate representative your
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
principled stand but I think probably
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is the same could be
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
said about any federal money that we
 
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
accept and um pay for and I certainly um
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
do have a philosophy of government um
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
providing a broad safety net for people
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
so I will support the bill I also have a
 
01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
question for the chair which is
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
um whether this actually can go on the
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
consent calendar because there is no
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the bill I had written
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
a um an amendment with an appropriation
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
but I have not introduce that so
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
currently there's no appropriation that
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be done by the finance
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee or they would have to extend
 
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
the um date at which the bill took
 
01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
effect um so my question really is can
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
we put it on the um consent calendar
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
since currently there's no appropriation
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill there is a the fiscal note
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
which says an approximate amount of
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
money that it would
 
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
cost thank you representative we you
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
would know better than I but I would
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
think it could go on if if if depending
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
on how the vot different speakers have
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
had different rules so I am um loath to
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
utter what is might be a definitive
 
01:47:55.229 --> 01:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
opinion um my understanding in the past
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
was that if it didn't have an actual
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation it didn't have to go on
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar and the other thing
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
is this bill is going to go to finance
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
so it's not like it's the last word but
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
I don't care about the consent calendar
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
if we could just vote on the bill and
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
get on to the other five that we have
 
01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:17.030 align:start position:0%
get on to the other five that we have
representative

01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you Mr chairman I just want to
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
remind us that we had an incredible
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
outpouring of um people present uh uh
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
showing their commitment every single
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
time we have touched this bill and I
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
think the principle underlying the need
 
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
for it is um in addition to all the good
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
points that have been made previously
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
is when we need to call 911 for
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves or our mother it doesn't
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
matter who's paying the bill if that
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
emergency uh service provider does no
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
longer exist because they went out of
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
business it doesn't matter if we have
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
gold star health insurance of our own
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
like that will not be available so this
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
is a public good that we need to be able
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
to assure continues to exist in this
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
state and I I don't see why we're not
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
all in agreement on
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
that representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
chairman and again you know for fear
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we would uh derail where we're
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
heading for not a pass with an amendment
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
um what I wondered about and what I
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
thought about when I was watching and
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
you can't really scream through the
 
01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:23.229 align:start position:0%
you can't really scream through the
camera

01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
camera
 
01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
that is in front of you all but having
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
said that one of the questions I had and
 
01:49:32.669 --> 01:49:32.679 align:start position:0%
I still have is why the regulations for
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
the repayment for that one patient that
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
switched from Medicare or from Medicare
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
when was on Medicaid why couldn't they
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
have the same regulation as for
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that is um the same
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
regulation that the Medicare patient has
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
so that that's more of a question than
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
it was and I don't want to do rail where
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
we're going right now but one of my
 
01:49:58.510 --> 01:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions was always you know why do we
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
have why why couldn't the same
 
01:50:04.350 --> 01:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory you know um mandates for
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid be the same as for
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
Medicare with just the fact that we
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
accept a smaller reimbursement which we
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
know anyway so that was more of a
 
01:50:15.629 --> 01:50:15.639 align:start position:0%
question than it was a um or a statement
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
than it is a true question so I don't
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
want to derail where we're going but
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
again that was always my question that I
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
had from the get-go thank thank
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%

01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%

motion I move to interim
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
study on Senate Bill uh 455 FN 55 FN
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%

01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
second I'll
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%

just um this
 
01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
issue needs more study because there
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
were some conflicting numbers during
 
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
testimony so while it's an important
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
issue I think we need to study it
 
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
more thank you representative
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm going to get vote against
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
interm study because it seems to me that
 
01:52:49.679 --> 01:52:50.629 align:start position:0%
interm study because it seems to me that
the

01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
policy the underlying
 
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
policy is a good one we want people to
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for services to people who
 
01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.550 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for services to people who
need

01:53:03.550 --> 01:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics and this bill is a second
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
committee bill it's going to
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
finance and so the
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
underlying policy which is I want people
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
to have the devices that they need to
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
live their fullest lives and I want the
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
people people who make those devices to
 
01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed to the best of our ability
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
to do it which is not going to be as
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
much as they should be reimbursed in any
 
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
case so I hope that people will defeat
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
the interim study so a motion of ought
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
to pass may be made so that this can go
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
on to finance and they can decide
 
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's something that we can
 
01:53:48.669 --> 01:53:48.679 align:start position:0%
afford or not representative Nagel thank
 
01:53:51.149 --> 01:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um this bill is really
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
important to me I've been involved in
 
01:53:55.950 --> 01:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
this discussion for a very long time and
 
01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
the best thing that came out of that
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
hearing was that the testimony was given
 
01:54:02.589 --> 01:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
by an independent
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
organization um beginning 30 40 years
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
ago the concept of an independent vendor
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
being able to do this was like because
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid payments was like
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
non-existent that the fact that these
 
01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
guys even still existed just totally
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
blew me away um what bothered me even
 
01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
more was the number of vendors we have
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
in the state and how few are we're
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
talking about a group of people that
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
deal with a very traditional historic
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population as a large part of
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
their their payer base um these are the
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities that are not
 
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
going to be competitively employed um
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
many of them have cognitive disabilities
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
and addition to their physical
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities so they're people that
 
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
really rely on the state for survival
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
and with these braces and and I don't we
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
can't ignore the orthotic part of it cuz
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
building an orthotic is an art form
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
um that that I kind of think they
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
trivialized during the discussion but
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know Prosthetics and Orthodox is
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
really important but it allows these
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
people to function to get into the
 
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
community to have a meaningful life um
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
they are not getting the blades that um
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know the the Olympians are getting
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
which is kind of sad in a way but you
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
know they're doing the best they can for
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
these people um one of the things that
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
was bothers me a lot is like in a
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
prosthetic development like when you
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
have an amputation the way we did it
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
when I started out murf you may or may
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
not remember this but we did immediate
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
posttop fitting so that the person woke
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
up with a leg on their on their their
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
leg and they um you know there's a lot
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
of reasons why I did it there were both
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
medical and psychological and social but
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
at the same point they don't there's no
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
way in hou hockey sticks that I decided
 
01:55:47.229 --> 01:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
to not swear that you can do that on
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid because it's a bundled payment
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
and everything that you do costs you
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
money in the end so we're not providing
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
the service that people need now and
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
this allows them to stay in business to
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
stay in function and the last thing I
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
will point out is that these guys
 
01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
everybody needs an easy Bill to get
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
through really
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
quick everybody needs an easy thing in
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
work that this is makes your job a
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
little bit quicker for at least 10
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
minutes these guys used to do a lot of
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf orthotic fits guess who
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
took that from them my group other
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
groups things like that now we do the
 
01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
fitting we get the money and when what
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
we do is we delegate Medicaid to these
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
guys so they have to give the braces
 
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
that don't generate any Revenue because
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
nobody else does it and he said it right
 
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
to us that if this they're going to make
 
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
a vote within the next year whe they're
 
01:56:38.109 --> 01:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
going to accept Medicaid anymore and
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's not good that's bad and and I
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
really think that it's important we
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you other
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Merchant thank
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I definitely want to oppose
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
the interim study I believe there a
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
couple things that I would focus my
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
attention on I will be focusing my
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
attention on one is that it's something
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's desperately needed from a certain
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
part of our population that itself is
 
01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to many things but looking at
 
01:57:10.589 --> 01:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
it from a financial point of view from
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
the state itself the best way to get
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
somebody off from Medicaid is for them
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
to get back to work and if you don't
 
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
have the appropriate prosthetic devices
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
to help the person be become gainfully
 
01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
employed they remain on the state
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
coffers because that's where they have
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
to be because they don't have the
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to become gainfully employed
 
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
so as a self-interest from the state
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
itself looking at strictly from a
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
financial point of view the more we can
 
01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
do to help people to get out of the
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system and into full employment
 
01:57:46.069 --> 01:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
I think it serves us all at the end
 
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately representative Murphy
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um in
 
01:57:52.589 --> 01:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
reference to representative Nel's
 
01:57:54.430 --> 01:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
question it was used we used to call it
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
an IOP because it was immediate
 
01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
post-operative you know prosthesis that
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
we would put on patients but having said
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
that you know it was interesting because
 
01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
it was probably only within the last
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
week they had one of the Prosthetics and
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
Orthotics folks from New Hampshire down
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
the SE Coast I believe it was that
 
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
talked about this there are only five in
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
the state that do uh these processes in
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
orthotic management and they basically
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
lose every time that they put one of
 
01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
these on for a patient with Medicaid so
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
they said well why would you charge
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
anything anyway well because something
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
is better than nothing and it over
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
offsets some of the cost that they have
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in their business so the long
 
01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
story short was that they did give
 
01:58:37.709 --> 01:58:37.719 align:start position:0%
examples of people that actually would
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
be able to return to the workforce were
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
able to take care of themselves were
 
01:58:44.189 --> 01:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
able to take care of their family uh if
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
they were able to be mobile so uh I
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
would vote against the uh interim study
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
and hope that a different motion would
 
01:58:54.069 --> 01:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
be um uh proposed representative Lon um
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I actually
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
wrote my College admission essay about
 
01:58:59.550 --> 01:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
making a prosthetic that could return a
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
concert violinist uh performing so
 
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics there's definitely something
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
that I have a big interest in um one of
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
the things that I did here was that
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the reimbursement is higher
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
than that 90% of Medicaid which is one
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why I'm going to support
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
the interim study but if that fails I'm
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
also um going to be supporting the bill
 
01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:19.639 align:start position:0%
because I think that we don't want to
 
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
cut short the ability to pay for it at a
 
01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
higher rate either so thank you other
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representative mlan just
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
clarification um I thought that this
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
bill just moved it from 80% to 90% so
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
would that is that a real concern
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
um so again I'm just asking for
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
clarification because it would obviously
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
the original Bill asked for 100% And
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
then it was amended down to 90% but I
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
don't personally think they get I mean
 
02:00:02.589 --> 02:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
the rule of thumb on Medicaid's 10 cents
 
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
on the dollar
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so my understanding 30 cents on the
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
dollar my understanding was that it was
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
at least 80% um this is my understanding
 
02:00:13.950 --> 02:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't think the interim study
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
motion is going to pass but my
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's at least 80%
 
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
but this says equal to 90% of the
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of
 
02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%

motion relative to the state be uh loan
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
repayment program for qualified nursing
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%

02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%

a to pass representative Shapiro moves
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
out to pass is there a
 
02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:50.679 align:start position:0%
second representative Weber seconds
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro you want to speak
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
to your
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
motion yes I think this um bill as it
 
02:04:59.790 --> 02:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
was explained during the hearing is
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
um a a very moderate expansion of the
 
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
slurp program the student loan repayment
 
02:05:10.109 --> 02:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
program for medical
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
providers and um it just adds
 
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
$300,000 specifically for nurses with
 
02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.549 --> 02:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
um I
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
mean it's money it's $300,000 but in in
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
my mind that's a a pretty moderate
 
02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
expansion of a program that's meant to
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
um enhance Workforce specifically in an
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
area that has become particularly
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
problematic which is Nurses which um and
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
and and we've talked a lot about how um
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
there are so many nursing agents nurses
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
that are providing care in variety of
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
places especially nursing homes um which
 
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
just UPS the cost um for our County
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and other nursing homes so
 
02:06:07.629 --> 02:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
I think this is a an effort to remedy
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
that by helping students with large um
 
02:06:16.149 --> 02:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
student loans thank you other
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Murphy uh
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and um one of the
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
things I came to realize was that uh
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
it's not just the Community Hospitals
 
02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's at the major medical centers that
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
nearly 80% right now near 80% of the
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
nurse Force at DH right now is Travelers
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's a very expensive ticket to pay
 
02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
for you know on a regular basis um and
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
so what I'm saying is that what what
 
02:06:46.109 --> 02:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
we've also realized too in training
 
02:06:49.709 --> 02:06:49.719 align:start position:0%
programs is that if somebody moves here
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
and stays here and starts to work here
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
will stay here so I think it will help
 
02:06:55.629 --> 02:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
the the nursing homes the Community
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
Hospitals but also the tertiary and
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
quary Care Medical Centers thank you
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lon um thank
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um and uh just looking
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
from my economic background and working
 
02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
with companies that sought Financial
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities and then moved as a
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
temporary benefit left I appreciate the
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
the goal of trying to do this but I'm
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
not sure that somebody who's moving for
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
a temporary Financial benefit won't then
 
02:07:22.549 --> 02:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
move for another temporary Financial
 
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
benefit um quite frankly when you look
 
02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:26.679 align:start position:0%
at the economic incentives it makes
 
02:07:28.109 --> 02:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
sense for a New Hampshire nurse to be a
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
travel nurse elsewhere and people from
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
other states to come here so my concern
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
is just continuing to further muddy
 
02:07:37.709 --> 02:07:37.719 align:start position:0%
muddy the waters with additional money
 
02:07:39.629 --> 02:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
here money there and just as a
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
policy-wise I don't think that um I
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
think that we're just compounding the
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
problem more and more so while I
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate the burden of this debt I
 
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate how challenging it is to be
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
here I just don't think that it's the
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
right solution
 
02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:54.589 align:start position:0%
right solution

02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
although it is a a limited amount of
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
money it is nevertheless consuming
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars um I I think we've seen
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
similar concerns on a national level
 
02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
when we have taxpayers at large often
 
02:08:21.629 --> 02:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
including people who never had
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to Avail themselves of
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
higher education could not afford higher
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
education um subsidizing the higher
 
02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
education of those who could um I I
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that's right I think what
 
02:08:37.629 --> 02:08:37.639 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're we're trying to uh
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
Tinker with um a a problem that is
 
02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:45.079 align:start position:0%
driven by the fundamental economics um a
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
you if if the economics are broken um I
 
02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:50.069 align:start position:0%
you if if the economics are broken um I
I

02:08:50.069 --> 02:08:50.079 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
think trying trying to insert uh a
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid into that situation that um
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
really doesn't fix the problem on any on
 
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
any scale um is the wrong approach so
 
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be voting against uh this
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
OTP motion representative
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair I concur
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
with representative Cal in the sense
 
02:09:14.589 --> 02:09:14.599 align:start position:0%
that um the economic supply and demand
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
however also look at it from Another
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
Side and that is particularly in the
 
02:09:20.430 --> 02:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes that we subsidize
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
heavily from the state
 
02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
coffers that if they're having to pay
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
more for traveling
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
nurses ultimately we're paying for it
 
02:09:31.549 --> 02:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
anyways so at this point in time it's an
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us because there a
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
report required to find out how well
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
this program actually worked it's more
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
of a pilot to begin to understand in
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
fact by doing an incentive to people to
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
come to the state of New Hampshire to
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
work here does it in fact help us with
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
the economics because if we don't find a
 
02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
way to reduce the labor cost in
 
02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
particularly nursing homes we ultimately
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
pay the price when I say we I'm talking
 
02:09:59.950 --> 02:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
about the state coers itself it's coming
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
out of our state budget so one way or
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
the other either we're going to pay for
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
it because it's coming out of the
 
02:10:07.629 --> 02:10:07.639 align:start position:0%
request from the counties to the state
 
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
itself for more dollars to support their
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
deficits or we find a way to reduce the
 
02:10:15.629 --> 02:10:15.639 align:start position:0%
burden because labor pool becomes
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
greater to drive the labor cost down so
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
I'll look at it stly from that point of
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
view thank you represent shapo thank you
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I think we all um are
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
guilty of using hyperbole you know once
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
in a while to prove our point but um so
 
02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
it would be crazy for me to say that
 
02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to solve the workforce um
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
problem with nurses I mean we I think we
 
02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
could all agree that this
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
is if anything it will barely make a
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
dent um but I personally was moved by
 
02:10:49.549 --> 02:10:49.559 align:start position:0%
talking to Christine Stoddard who
 
02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
represents the qualified
 
02:10:56.189 --> 02:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
um Health Centers um and the degree to
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
which they take advantage of the student
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
loan repayment program that the state um
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
runs um to keep people in jobs that are
 
02:11:08.430 --> 02:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
probably not the most high-paying
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
nursing jobs and so I just think we
 
02:11:16.589 --> 02:11:16.599 align:start position:0%
should do our part to add to that effort
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's not going to bring all
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
the nurses running to New Hampshire
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
other yes representative
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
TZ uh thank you Mr chairman I think um
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
without arguing about how economics
 
02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
actually plays out in real life I I
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
think this is needed it's needed by um
 
02:11:39.599 --> 02:11:40.669 align:start position:0%
think this is needed it's needed by um
the

02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
employers um State loaner payment is a
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
very proven uh strategy that's used all
 
02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
over the country
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
to put providers of healthare in places
 
02:11:55.709 --> 02:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
where it's needed so similar to the
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
ambulance bill we just discussed There
 
02:12:00.910 --> 02:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
Are Places rural New Hampshire other
 
02:12:04.030 --> 02:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
places that are high need so people of
 
02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
low economic means can have access to
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
health care access to healthcare then
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
helps you uh access better education and
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
better better employment opportunities
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
so um thinking about this investment
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
which is very modest and which is being
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
requested because of the need that's
 
02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
already been established and proven um
 
02:12:29.549 --> 02:12:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh makes a lot of sense thank you other
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lon and then
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative mlan uh thank you Mr
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
chairman um economics isn't just
 
02:12:37.189 --> 02:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
something that's thought about in Ivory
 
02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
Towers it's something that impacts Our
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
Lives day-to-day um and especially as
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
state legislators we need to understand
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
how to best allocate our limited
 
02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
resources many of us supported the
 
02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
ambulance bill because it is absolutely
 
02:12:51.149 --> 02:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
crucial to make sure that our first resp
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
responders are paid for providing these
 
02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
vital services that we require them to
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
do and that quite frankly we count on
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
them to do um this bill it may or may
 
02:13:02.669 --> 02:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
not attract people we've said that it
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
probably won't make much of a difference
 
02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
we are looking at revenues that are
 
02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
going down from the state because it
 
02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
looks like the market you know I feel
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
like I'm on a roller coaster I'm
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
starting to look it looks like the
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
economy is probably heading back down
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
again I know that some people say that's
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
a reason for more subsidies but the
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
other question is where do we bring the
 
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
money from
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
do we want to then defund um the these
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
payments that we're having for these
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
non-transport calls is there something
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
else that we're not going to pay for in
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
exchange for the loan the student the
 
02:13:34.990 --> 02:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
student loan repayment for nurses you
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
know we're to be stewards I know
 
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that we're not the finance
 
02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
committee but giving an idea of which
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
policy we think is going to have a
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
greater impact to granted Staters
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
matters too I know that I believe that
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
the ambulance bill has a far greater
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
impact to Granite Staters then um
 
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
something that will be a nice to have
 
02:13:56.669 --> 02:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
that may keep a few more nurses in
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
practice but that isn't going to move
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
the needle is significantly um and
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's why that's why if we're not going
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
to have people coming here for this if
 
02:14:09.549 --> 02:14:09.559 align:start position:0%
it's something that um even if they do
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
come it's because they're chasing the
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
largest opportunity and I'm an economist
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm a market person I don't have a
 
02:14:18.549 --> 02:14:18.559 align:start position:0%
problem with chasing opportunity and my
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
idea is that hopefully people will find
 
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
their way here and just like me say wow
 
02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
I finally found home um and my hope is
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
that we'll have people that come here
 
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
and say wow I finally found home but I'm
 
02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
not certain that loan repayment is going
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
to be that segment you know the more
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we we respect and honor the people
 
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
and make sure that their autonomy U
 
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
personal autonomy as healthc care
 
02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
providers is respected the better as
 
02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
well so um I I recognize why many people
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
on here think that it's important but I
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
think that we're better off putting that
 
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
money towards reimbursement for non-
 
02:14:58.549 --> 02:14:58.559 align:start position:0%
transport than for this that um doesn't
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
seem like it'll help and it may provide
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
some um incorrect influences
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative mlan and then
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative pmer thank you Mr chair I
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
mean I I I support the intention of this
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
bill but as was alluded to earlier
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
realistically it's not going to do
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
anything and with money in limited
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
Supply why would we give it if we don't
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
think it's going to in achieve the
 
02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
desired intention the the fact of the
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
matter is there is such a huge dollar
 
02:15:30.430 --> 02:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
difference between what the traveler is
 
02:15:32.910 --> 02:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
paid and and what the regular person is
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
paid that is what you're going to have
 
02:15:37.149 --> 02:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
to look at and that's what you're going
 
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
to have to do with respect to your pay
 
02:15:41.310 --> 02:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
structure and that's a much harder
 
02:15:44.430 --> 02:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
decision and and much more difficult
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
solution for hospitals to drive towards
 
02:15:49.229 --> 02:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
and I have a lot of Sympathy For That in
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
in in an area of rising Healthcare costs
 
02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
but that's what it's going to take we
 
02:15:55.549 --> 02:15:55.559 align:start position:0%
had somebody alluded to discussions at
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
the county level we talked about the
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
same thing at Hillsboro County for
 
02:16:03.390 --> 02:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
retention bonuses for uh the uh the the
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
deputies with the county sheriff it was
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
a $3,000 retention bonus but the
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester police are poaching them and
 
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
they're giving them $30,000 more and so
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
my heart says yeah but is it going to
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
achieve the the desired effect and with
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
money being what it is
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
um we need to have people looking at the
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
real solutions not the feel-good
 
02:16:28.270 --> 02:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
Solutions in my opinion so I support the
 
02:16:30.750 --> 02:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
intent but I can't support the bill
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer and then
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Shapero so I guess um I'm
 
02:16:38.190 --> 02:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
thinking this this is a short-term fix
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about the long-term
 
02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
fix the short-term problem is um so
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
there was a nurse yesterday at work and
 
02:16:47.709 --> 02:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
she took a job at the hospital I work at
 
02:16:49.950 --> 02:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
in Vermont because Vermont has a pretty
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
good loan reimbursement program as
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to in New
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um good for us but the problem
 
02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
the short-term problem is that we still
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
um have empty beds that we can't fill
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
because we don't have nurses I can't
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
send really sick patients to Dartmouth
 
02:17:08.349 --> 02:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
because they don't have nurses and so
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
short term we need to sort of I my my
 
02:17:12.349 --> 02:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
opinion on this is that we need to sort
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
of take any little bit we can get to
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
fill in plug a few holes the long-term
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
um Solutions are being looked at the
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
primary care Commission has got really
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
nice data to show that if we train more
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
nurses in New Hampshire they stay here
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
and that's that's that's the good
 
02:17:30.509 --> 02:17:30.519 align:start position:0%
long-term solution and the same thing is
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
being applied to Physicians with new
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
residency programs in New Hampshire so I
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a great solution but
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
it but short term we need to do
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
something because we're we're you know
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're really struggling to take care of
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
patients representative
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes uh maybe we've talked this
 
02:17:52.309 --> 02:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
one through um see a few shaking heads
 
02:17:55.629 --> 02:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
but I guess my my thought is that um
 
02:17:58.509 --> 02:17:58.519 align:start position:0%
when people say this is just a Band-Aid
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
that that's that's code for this is not
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
useful but when you need a Band-Aid you
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
need a Band-Aid and I think this is a
 
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid but I think it's sometimes very
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
useful to have a Band-Aid and we
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
probably have different underlying
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
philosophical um philosophies about
 
02:18:18.669 --> 02:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
these kind of things that will dictate
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
our vote but I'm going to vote for it
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
because I think it's a useful bandaid
 
02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative Nel thank you Mr chairman
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
I I would Define this as more of an
 
02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
orthotic than a Band-Aid but anyways oh
 
02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
keep it pertinent um you know it's
 
02:18:34.589 --> 02:18:34.599 align:start position:0%
really weird when we're going through
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
all these bills I'm looking at you know
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea this is a good idea
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea who's going to pay
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
for it who's going to pay for it who's
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to pay for it so I had a
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
conversation with somebody way smarter
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
than me and he told me it's not your
 
02:18:48.509 --> 02:18:48.519 align:start position:0%
decision to make who's paying for it to
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether the the idea as value I I
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything that Dr Palmer
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
said um um continuity is unbelievably
 
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
important in healthcare and we don't
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
have it and travelers do not provide
 
02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
continuity they're here today gone
 
02:19:04.589 --> 02:19:04.599 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and there's a lot of people
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
that that we've seen you know nurses or
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
whatever that um you know with with
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
things like this will will'll choose to
 
02:19:14.190 --> 02:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
stay and that's important and if you
 
02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
have a nursing home like the counting
 
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
home or wherever you know your goal is
 
02:19:19.549 --> 02:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
just to have at least a percentage of
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
people that stay and and this does help
 
02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these entities actually do
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
subsidize education now on their own um
 
02:19:30.509 --> 02:19:30.519 align:start position:0%
if I had to tell the finance department
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
and prioritize this relative to some of
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
the other things we've talked about this
 
02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
would not be number one on my list with
 
02:19:38.910 --> 02:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
that said that's their decision not mine
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm going to support it
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative South King thank you Mr
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
chair um one thing that seems absent
 
02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
from this conversation is where did all
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
the nurses go cuz you know just a few
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
years ago we didn't have this sort of
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
really bad nurse deficit and then
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
something happened and all of a sudden
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
we had a huge labor pool of nurses
 
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
leaving including my wife as a matter of
 
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
fact the nursing uh environment became
 
02:20:07.150 --> 02:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
extremely hostile for like half of the
 
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
nurses and they just disappeared so you
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
might want to think about that if you
 
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what I'm talking about I'll
 
02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
tell you right now that in order to even
 
02:20:15.790 --> 02:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
I was looking at it a few years ago I
 
02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's still the case but if
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
in order to even start the path of
 
02:20:21.309 --> 02:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
becoming a new nurse
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
to go to school they were mandating
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines just to go to school so
 
02:20:29.070 --> 02:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
not only have we alienated a huge
 
02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
portion of nurses from the workforce
 
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
we've also alienated half of half of
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
this country who would otherwise think
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
about becoming nurses saying I'm not
 
02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
going to take that stupid vaccine just
 
02:20:41.790 --> 02:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
so I could go to school to become a
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
nurse and they're going to go do
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
something else so if you want to really
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
alleviate the
 
02:20:49.389 --> 02:20:49.399 align:start position:0%
problem get rid of the thing that's
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
causing the problem don't just add
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
little Band-Aids to the situation thank
 
02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
you representative I was just wondering
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
if we could move along to the vote okay
 
02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
is there anything new anyone has
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
representative TZ I just want to add
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of complexity to why
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
there's a nursing shortage in addition
 
02:21:10.349 --> 02:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
to uh fifth of the workforce leaving as
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
a result of the pandemic and related um
 
02:21:16.349 --> 02:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
feelings and attitudes um we it's
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
longstanding and that's why the
 
02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
legislative Commission on the
 
02:21:20.670 --> 02:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary primer Workforce
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
exists and a whole other uh set of
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
people working on addressing these
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues that relate to supply
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
so that's why these strategies of um
 
02:21:33.150 --> 02:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
loaner payment which have been proven to
 
02:21:34.990 --> 02:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
be effective and which the employers are
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
requesting are um immediately helpful
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
02:21:42.349 --> 02:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
Seth King for bringing up one of the big
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
issues that we have here other states
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
successfully pushed back and allowed
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
their healthcare providers that wanted
 
02:21:53.349 --> 02:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
to continue to care for patients to do
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
so with other Mr chairman I am going to
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
object to refighting the covid and
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
masking Wars in a context of a bill that
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
you may be for or you may be against but
 
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
which does not have anything to do with
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
that so given that we
 
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
have four to finish I ask that that be
 
02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
ruled out of order representative land
 
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
point of order if somebody is to
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
interrupt aren't they supposed to ask
 
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
for a point of order and then be
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
recognized by the chair instead of just
 
02:22:33.389 --> 02:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
speaking my apologies I should have done
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
that this is a and if I may continue
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
this is a causal Factor this is a causal
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
Factor where we had multiple healthc
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
care providers leaving we had people who
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
were not going to nursing school if we
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
think $300,000 in R loan repayment is
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem we are
 
02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
looking in the wrong place I have seen
 
02:22:56.830 --> 02:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
certifications thanking um respit homes
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
places of Last Resort care thanking them
 
02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
for having a vaccination rate of 75% yet
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
we had a zero tolerance policy in this
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
state and we are suffering for it we
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
have beds that are not filled because of
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we can't just sweep this under the
 
02:23:15.150 --> 02:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
rug because this has caused harm it's
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
caused far more harm by requiring this
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
and pushing people out of the workforce
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
than um then a vaccine that did not show
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
point of order Mr chairman point of
 
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
order yes would you rule on my prior
 
02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
point of order no matter how inartfully
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
stated I I I think this discussion I
 
02:23:38.429 --> 02:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
think we've gone past the uh the debate
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
that's relevant for this bill and uh at
 
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
this point I think we're we're getting
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
into other issues so let let's just move
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
on I think everybody knows where
 
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
everybody stands on covid masks
 
02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
um and and and and I'm not going to get
 
02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
into the merits or the demerits of any
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
aspects of of the arguments but uh
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative Leon I respect what
 
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying and I understand your
 
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
points uh but clearly uh at this point
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
the mood of the room is is that we need
 
02:24:08.990 --> 02:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
to move on and and why don't we do so
 
02:24:10.269 --> 02:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the clerk to call the
 
02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
all the motion is uh ought to pass on
 
02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:18.520 align:start position:0%

496

02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:20.160 --> 02:28:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:22.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative Weber do you want to
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
make a motion um I would move the
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
2024-25 with the bill this addresses
 
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
some of them um I think we heard loud
 
02:28:58.750 --> 02:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
and clear the need for some kind of
 
02:29:03.790 --> 02:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
Regulation um and the concern that I had
 
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
personally was the definitions were a
 
02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.030 align:start position:0%
personally was the definitions were a
little

02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
circular uh but in fact the the initial
 
02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
stuff that I objected to and in the
 
02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
first part is existing language so I
 
02:29:19.630 --> 02:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to mess with that CU I don't
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
want to m up what we may already be
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
doing in other contexts so this looks at
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
section Roman 2 which is the added
 
02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
language and there were several
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
objections there one of which was we
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
weren't terribly sure what we were
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:29:44.429 --> 02:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
secondly uh the residential treatment
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
was included and we were told that
 
02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
residential treatment was not included
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
so what the the amendment makes clear is
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
that it does not apply to residential
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
treatment so that uh because that was
 
02:30:00.910 --> 02:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
taken out and the other thing that was
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
omitted was the language about shall
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
include but not be limited to so uh the
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
door is not fully open the door is
 
02:30:14.309 --> 02:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
limited to these items which
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
are as far as I know set out by the
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
American Society for Addictive medicine
 
02:30:22.269 --> 02:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
so in that respect I think it makes it
 
02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
clearer as to what we're talking about
 
02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
and um that's where we're at other
 
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment I
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
chair apologies for my confus confusion
 
02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
on this I'm I'm just not I'm just not
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
sure what's being changed in the
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
original bill it says amend RSA
 
02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
172 but then in the original bill it
 
02:30:49.710 --> 02:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
says amend RSA 126a and what just can
 
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
you just fill me in what part's being
 
02:30:54.670 --> 02:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't well the origin the bill is
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
exactly as it was in the original if you
 
02:31:03.269 --> 02:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
look at the original Bill the only thing
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
that this is changing in the
 
02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
amendment is the definitional section
 
02:31:14.309 --> 02:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
under two which is the
 
02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
part that relates
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the the state substance use of
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
disorder Services System but that is
 
02:31:28.030 --> 02:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
already existing language if you see in
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
the original bill as we received it that
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
is not in bold that is in statute now so
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
that already
 
02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
exists this is an addition to existing
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
statute and so all it's doing is
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
changing the added definitional
 
02:31:49.469 --> 02:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
section I'm sorry I'm looking at
 
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment to SB 495 FN I think I screwed
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
up because we're on Bill 496 now right
 
02:31:57.830 --> 02:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
what are we doing
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
no my apologies it's line it's line 26
 
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.150 --> 02:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
okay we've certainly done a lot to burn
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
up uh our energy this morning but um
 
02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:14.389 align:start position:0%
up uh our energy this morning but um

representative
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
mlan uh thank you Mr chair and um I
 
02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
guess I have a question for some of the
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
folks in the committee
 
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
um in the in the week since we we had
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
the public hearing I was very confused
 
02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
probably had a lot of circular
 
02:32:28.349 --> 02:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
questioning which probably confuse
 
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
everybody even more but I think I kind
 
02:32:32.190 --> 02:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
of understand it now I did communicate
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know with the folks at Manchester
 
02:32:36.510 --> 02:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
where obviously we have a real problem
 
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
and um substance abuse treatment in an
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
unregulated manner in the city is a real
 
02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
problem speaking with the mayor last
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
night he said look this is the reality
 
02:32:49.389 --> 02:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
the reality is you spend 90 days in
 
02:32:51.269 --> 02:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
Valley Street stre jail you come out
 
02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
you're clean you go in to get your
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
treatment and you're being treated by
 
02:32:58.630 --> 02:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
someone who's been sober for 30 days and
 
02:33:01.630 --> 02:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
everything kind of goes off the rails so
 
02:33:06.670 --> 02:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
um I agree and I a th% support the
 
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
intent and the need of this and I
 
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
communicated that to the mayor my
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
concern was from what I was able to
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
gather out of the testimony last week
 
02:33:17.590 --> 02:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
there was some real concerns with
 
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
respect to the breadth so not knowing a
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
lot about it to the extent of some of
 
02:33:24.750 --> 02:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
the other folks those folks that had
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
objections about does this eat into AA
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
does this eat into the single shingle
 
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:33.640 align:start position:0%
person does the amendment you know going
 
02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
in and eliminating that language you
 
02:33:38.269 --> 02:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
know that says hey this is but not
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
limited to is that adequate to address
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
those concerns or do we need to inm
 
02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
study that so I guess I'm just throwing
 
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
that question out there to those folks
 
02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
who had those concerns to maybe give
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
some feedback to to let me know where
 
02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
they're at at this point Thank you Mr
 
02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
chair representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you representative
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
Weber for bringing this amendment I
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
think that you've clarified quite a few
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
things but I think I have even more
 
02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
questions now I don't know what the
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
outpatient services set by the American
 
02:34:13.269 --> 02:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
Society of addiction medicine are I
 
02:34:14.590 --> 02:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what that includes and I
 
02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what that's going to um
 
02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
impact I I think that this is a highly
 
02:34:19.319 --> 02:34:20.309 align:start position:0%
impact I I think that this is a highly
complex

02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
complex
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
issue and it's one where when it was
 
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
brought forth it seems like um it seems
 
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
like some of the issues that this was
 
02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
designed to solve were actually
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
happening in residential facilities
 
02:34:32.830 --> 02:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
where they should already be licensed so
 
02:34:35.150 --> 02:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
I think that that while it would be
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
great to be able to do something right
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
now this amendment helps but I really
 
02:34:42.269 --> 02:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
think that um we need to truly take a
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
look at this and truly work on this as
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
an interim study so that we can figure
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
out what the right approach is because
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're right fly by night uh recovery
 
02:34:52.590 --> 02:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
clinics are not the right way to go
 
02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
about it but how do we know that this
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
process is going to fix it and when you
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
look at the entire context of it too
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
with the rul making process this is
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
going to take time in order to figure
 
02:35:06.190 --> 02:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
out how to get it done and how to do it
 
02:35:09.269 --> 02:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
correctly and because of that time frame
 
02:35:11.550 --> 02:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
because of that need because we're
 
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out all these balances
 
02:35:15.269 --> 02:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to rush into something
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be the right
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
solution and then we're trying to figure
 
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
it out and then we need to come in and
 
02:35:21.950 --> 02:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
change it next year as opposed to us
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
spending the time to to meet with those
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
who are addressed and impacted talk and
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
see if AA would fall underneath this see
 
02:35:31.790 --> 02:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
if other peer recovery would fall
 
02:35:35.309 --> 02:35:35.319 align:start position:0%
underneath it and just ensure that we're
 
02:35:37.389 --> 02:35:37.399 align:start position:0%
not making things worse in the process
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
of trying to make things better uh
 
02:35:41.309 --> 02:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly you know some of
 
02:35:43.230 --> 02:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
those big headline Grabbers should have
 
02:35:45.630 --> 02:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
been covered and we're not doing
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
anything to make sure that
 
02:35:50.269 --> 02:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a lot of different
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
things we could look to I mean when you
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
look at sexual assault a provider has
 
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
certain restrictions and things that
 
02:35:58.110 --> 02:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
could be done from an adult to an adult
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
are not acceptable if there's a provider
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
if somebody is not free to go in a
 
02:36:04.750 --> 02:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
prison or another situation anybody who
 
02:36:07.269 --> 02:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
has that control and power cannot have a
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
sexual relationship with somebody
 
02:36:11.150 --> 02:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
because of that imbalance of power we
 
02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
have nothing like that for sober homes
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
or people who run them so and this is a
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
significant issue actually in recovery I
 
02:36:21.630 --> 02:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
know people who have relapsed because um
 
02:36:23.070 --> 02:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
whether it was somebody who was in the
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
program and providing oversight or even
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
just another person in recovery you know
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
once you become a linked pair it's hard
 
02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
enough for one person to get out of
 
02:36:35.070 --> 02:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
addiction then having a pair um becomes
 
02:36:36.510 --> 02:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
more challenging when you have a new
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
partner your whole whole identity as a
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
couple is recovery and then one one
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
person hits a stumble it can pull the
 
02:36:44.349 --> 02:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
other one back in quite tightly
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't deal with the peer
 
02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
issues um but the fact that we have
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
nothing to address address that
 
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
imbalance of Power with people who were
 
02:36:53.790 --> 02:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
in recovery systems that's a significant
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
issue and one of the things that this
 
02:36:58.910 --> 02:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill um seems to have addressed so I I I
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
think that this will make us feel good
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that it's actually
 
02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to solve anything since the
 
02:37:06.910 --> 02:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
problems happen at already licensed um

02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
Shapiro um this certainly doesn't
 
02:37:17.910 --> 02:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
um answer all those questions but in
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
regard to an independent practitioner
 
02:37:23.309 --> 02:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
it's if you look at the amendment line
 
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
10 it's it explicitly says that
 
02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:27.910 align:start position:0%
10 it's it explicitly says that
independent

02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
independent
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
providers um are exempt from this
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
certification so it would not the
 
02:37:36.510 --> 02:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
language says that it would not include
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
um a a sole proprietorship Private
 
02:37:44.269 --> 02:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
Practice type situation um
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
and I mean I
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
guess I guess definitions can always be
 
02:37:53.790 --> 02:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
stretched and but it certainly seems
 
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
clear enough to me that that there are
 
02:37:59.429 --> 02:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
very specific things that are included
 
02:38:02.150 --> 02:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
in this amendment and they do not
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
include AA or anything that um sounds
 
02:38:09.870 --> 02:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
like um that kind of um volunteer
 
02:38:14.670 --> 02:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
self-help kind of um group
 
02:38:17.510 --> 02:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so anyway I just wanted to respond to
 
02:38:20.110 --> 02:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
the thing about private practitioners
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
they are explicitly excluded from this
 
02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:25.269 align:start position:0%
they are explicitly excluded from this

02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
think in the the the hearing and in this
 
02:38:33.630 --> 02:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
discussion I've heard statements that we
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
all agree there's a problem
 
02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
um I I respectfully do not agree that
 
02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
there is a demonstrated problem
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
um I find it very interesting that in
 
02:38:47.439 --> 02:38:48.110 align:start position:0%
um I find it very interesting that in
the

02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
hearing one of the cases that was cited
 
02:38:53.269 --> 02:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
multiple times as a
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
justification uh for why we need
 
02:38:59.550 --> 02:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
this pertained to licensed healthc care
 
02:39:00.910 --> 02:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
facilities something that occurred in
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
licensed Health Care Facilities um I do
 
02:39:08.349 --> 02:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
remain concerned about what happens with
 
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
um some of these you know faith-based
 
02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:11.590 align:start position:0%
um some of these you know faith-based
programs

02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
AA things like that I I think my my big
 
02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
concern about this is that it is
 
02:39:20.590 --> 02:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
creating broad sweeping regulatory power
 
02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:21.990 align:start position:0%
creating broad sweeping regulatory power
um

02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
where I don't think that we have
 
02:39:26.710 --> 02:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
substantiated a need for it if we were
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
to go interum study with this bill I
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
think that that would provide an
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to to look at it in
 
02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
more detail to understand if there's a
 
02:39:38.710 --> 02:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
need but you know the response that I I
 
02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
kept hearing was well that's exactly why
 
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
we need regulation is because we don't
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
have visibility okay well there's
 
02:39:46.429 --> 02:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
there's you either have visibility and
 
02:39:47.950 --> 02:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
there's a problem or you don't have
 
02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
visibility and you need visibility
 
02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that we would be well served
 
02:39:57.389 --> 02:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
by um speaking to a broader spectrum of
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
constituents and not just the uh three
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
or four people who who showed up at the
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
hearing to speak in support of the bill
 
02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:06.590 align:start position:0%
hearing to speak in support of the bill
representative

02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
Weber I was just going to say that in
 
02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
light of the confusion that people had
 
02:40:15.469 --> 02:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
originally which I will be the first to
 
02:40:18.190 --> 02:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
concede that this does not completely
 
02:40:22.590 --> 02:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
resolve uh um I wonder if rather than
 
02:40:25.950 --> 02:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
arguing back and forth over this it
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if we were to take a
 
02:40:30.349 --> 02:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
straw poll on how many people were
 
02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
interested in an interim study because
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
if that's the sense of the committee I
 
02:40:38.830 --> 02:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to take up the committee's
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
time um trying to explain something that
 
02:40:46.990 --> 02:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
came to me from people I trust but which
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
I have an imperfect understanding of
 
02:40:52.750 --> 02:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
um so I just offer that as a possible
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
way forward uh thank you that's
 
02:40:56.910 --> 02:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
something we may ask when the chair gets
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
back from his phone call I did look up
 
02:41:01.110 --> 02:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
Outpatient Treatment with the American
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
Society of um addiction medicine so um
 
02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
the level one treatment I'm going to
 
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
read the description and then let's fig
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
then um see if people want to see what
 
02:41:13.269 --> 02:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
that fits into it's services that assist
 
02:41:15.389 --> 02:41:15.399 align:start position:0%
an individual or group of individuals to
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
achieve treatment objectives through the
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
exploration of substance use disorders
 
02:41:19.359 --> 02:41:20.030 align:start position:0%
exploration of substance use disorders
their

02:41:20.030 --> 02:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
ramifications including an examination
 
02:41:24.110 --> 02:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
of attitudes and feelings and
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of alternative Solutions
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
and decision-making with regard to
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug related Pro
 
02:41:32.910 --> 02:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
problems um so this was this is me just
 
02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
working on the fly to understand this to
 
02:41:36.750 --> 02:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
me I've never been to AA but I have read
 
02:41:40.110 --> 02:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
the book um and to me it seems similar
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
to that um I don't know if there's I'm
 
02:41:44.309 --> 02:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
not asking anybody to say that they have
 
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
the experience but I it's it seems a
 
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
little close to me representative Nagel
 
02:41:51.309 --> 02:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
this is my my concern and this goes back
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
to that whole harm reduction thing you
 
02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
know we we relied on um you know as for
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know our our definitions but we
 
02:42:04.030 --> 02:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
looked at what they said and we wrote
 
02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
them down very specifically rather than
 
02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
making a reference to it and I don't
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
personally think you should have to go
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
to some other source to figure out what
 
02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I think if you're
 
02:42:15.469 --> 02:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
going to say that you need to say what
 
02:42:19.469 --> 02:42:19.479 align:start position:0%
it is you're saying that's my opinion
 
02:42:22.030 --> 02:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Merchant
 
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also want to
 
02:42:25.550 --> 02:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank representative Weber for um
 
02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
working on the
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
amendment what again I'm may even trying
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
to get too far into the weeds here but
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
on line four the amendment it talks
 
02:42:37.230 --> 02:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
about a certification process not a
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
certification so what I'm trying to
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
wrestle with in that are we talking
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
about how they become certified or what
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
the requirements are for them to become
 
02:42:47.950 --> 02:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
certified so what I'm trying to
 
02:42:49.309 --> 02:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
understand is that I go back to
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned before is that it's the
 
02:42:54.030 --> 02:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
individuals in a program that causes the
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
abuse not the program itself nor the
 
02:42:58.670 --> 02:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
facility so I want to be sure that
 
02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
somehow in the certification process
 
02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
whatever we're talking about the
 
02:43:05.269 --> 02:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
program how it's going to be developed
 
02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
and what the requirements are within
 
02:43:09.190 --> 02:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
that program because I really concern
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
myself with professionals and I'll go
 
02:43:13.269 --> 02:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
back and say something quickly on the
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
issue of regulatory um
 
02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
overload there's many times in which 95
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
% of people want to do the right thing
 
02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
and 5% of the people who don't and the
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
95% of people who are doing the right
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
thing Are burdened by the regulatory
 
02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
environment because they're going to do
 
02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
it anyways the 5% who don't want to deal
 
02:43:33.389 --> 02:43:33.399 align:start position:0%
with the regulatory issues probably
 
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to ignore the regulations anyways
 
02:43:36.830 --> 02:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
so I want to be careful that we don't
 
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
somehow take the ones that are doing the
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
best to be doing the right thing that we
 
02:43:44.190 --> 02:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
don't create more burden on them to try
 
02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
to protect the people from the 5% so
 
02:43:49.070 --> 02:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to repres
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
Senor Weber so this bill was presented
 
02:43:55.710 --> 02:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
to us as a way to allow the department
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
to start writing the rules that would
 
02:44:02.510 --> 02:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
answer the questions about what the
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
process was and things like background
 
02:44:08.590 --> 02:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
checks and other things that have been
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
suggested ought to be in
 
02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
there uh that said I do concur with the
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
idea that it's always better to have the
 
02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
actual standards in rather than a
 
02:44:23.550 --> 02:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
reference to something else Mr chairman
 
02:44:26.670 --> 02:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
when you were out of the room I said
 
02:44:30.269 --> 02:44:30.279 align:start position:0%
that I asked
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
that it
 
02:44:36.670 --> 02:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
seems like it might
 
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
be helpful given the questions that
 
02:44:43.550 --> 02:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
everybody has and what I'm hearing from
 
02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who've spoken
 
02:44:49.230 --> 02:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
if we took a straw pole on interm study
 
02:44:52.590 --> 02:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
rather than proceeding
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
immediately to try and parse this out uh
 
02:45:00.030 --> 02:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
because that might make things clearer
 
02:45:02.429 --> 02:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
and then again it might not uh that was
 
02:45:05.790 --> 02:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
my offer of a suggestion that might help
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
um if it
 
02:45:09.950 --> 02:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't or if people don't want to do
 
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
that I'm more than happy to proceed as
 
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
as we've gone on I think it's a good
 
02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
suggestion any objections to a straw
 
02:45:16.319 --> 02:45:19.469 align:start position:0%
suggestion any objections to a straw
poll

02:45:19.469 --> 02:45:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
on on interim
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
study how is that usually done by show
 
02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
of hands or yeah yeah okay all those who
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be favorable to interim study as
 
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
else all those
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
opposed okay apparently most F most of
 
02:45:42.590 --> 02:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
the committee favors interim study um I
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
would be willing to withdraw my motion
 
02:45:47.710 --> 02:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
if the seconder who I've now forgotten
 
02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:51.279 align:start position:0%

also um we we knew it was a complex
 
02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
issue from last week's hearing and uh we
 
02:46:05.950 --> 02:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
knew it was going to be a heavy lift to
 
02:46:07.469 --> 02:46:07.479 align:start position:0%
try to get it through since such a
 
02:46:09.870 --> 02:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
compressed time frame and you know at
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
least an effort was made I'm sorry it
 
02:46:13.710 --> 02:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
didn't well we don't know what's going
 
02:46:14.790 --> 02:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
to happen but it looks like it's going
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be interim study so anyway do I have
 
02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:19.120 align:start position:0%

presumptions in the bill that more
 
02:47:04.030 --> 02:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
regulation will solve the
 
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
problem thank you any other yes
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I just wanted to

to present the amendment because
 
02:47:14.349 --> 02:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely I'm glad to have it
 
02:47:16.990 --> 02:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
considered well absolutely and you know
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
again as I as I said earlier I want all
 
02:47:20.910 --> 02:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
all departments to feel that we we try
 
02:47:22.670 --> 02:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
to consider all aspects of every bill
 
02:47:28.269 --> 02:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
McKay I was going to say Thank you Mr
 
02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker don't say that I don't want to
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
be speaker I don't think you want that
 
02:47:39.150 --> 02:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to thank representative
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
Weber for what she did uh this is a very
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
valuable uh part that we can use in
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
interim study uh I wore myself out the
 
02:47:53.710 --> 02:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
other day
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh unusual for me this type of
 
02:48:02.830 --> 02:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
subject is extremely important to me and
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
I think to everybody else it's a very
 
02:48:11.870 --> 02:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
complex uh subject and I think interim
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
study opens it up for us uh to get at
 
02:48:21.070 --> 02:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
the the complexity of the subject I've I
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how many years I've been here
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
but it's all been for mental health
 
02:48:32.070 --> 02:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
issues and uh we've got massive
 
02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
information in the department including
 
02:48:39.469 --> 02:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
the 10year plans that go back years and
 
02:48:44.269 --> 02:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
years uh so that I think
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
the department was
 
02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
concerned with where we were at this
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
point with this legislation I think
 
02:48:55.429 --> 02:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
they're reassured that if we go to
 
02:48:58.349 --> 02:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
interim study we're going to come up
 
02:48:58.359 --> 02:49:00.150 align:start position:0%
interim study we're going to come up
with

02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that deals with a very
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
important part of our uh
 
02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
population that is often
 
02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
misunderstood and I go back to the point
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire hospital was a
 
02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
terrible place I've never criticized
 
02:49:22.190 --> 02:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
them because they did the best they
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
could until thorine came
 
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
along the there is much more that we can
 
02:49:34.150 --> 02:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
do now based on what we know and it's
 
02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
that that I would like to see that the
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
state takes responsibility for and
 
02:49:45.229 --> 02:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
that's my purpose for supporting interim
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
study to to use the information we
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
already have and to strengthen what is
 
02:49:56.389 --> 02:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
now a very good program thank you Mr
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr chairman thank
 
02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
you all right any other discussion on
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
the motion of interim study
 
02:50:05.630 --> 02:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative mlan yeah I just want to
 
02:50:06.590 --> 02:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
say I
 
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
mean man Manchester is Ground Zero when
 
02:50:12.269 --> 02:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
it comes to you know uh issues with with
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and talking to the
 
02:50:16.389 --> 02:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
people on the ground there this is a
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
real issue um and and so I do appreciate
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative who you bringing forth
 
02:50:22.750 --> 02:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment because it certainly
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
clarified and distilled a lot of stuff
 
02:50:27.510 --> 02:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
in my mind but I I do want to make sure
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
that we get it right and I do think that
 
02:50:32.030 --> 02:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
this is such an important issue that if
 
02:50:34.110 --> 02:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
we do bring it to interim study we are
 
02:50:37.269 --> 02:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
going to get lots of input from lots of
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders and I think it's
 
02:50:42.190 --> 02:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
going to be very valuable and um that's
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
all I have to
 
02:50:46.269 --> 02:50:46.279 align:start position:0%
say any other
 
02:50:49.590 --> 02:50:49.600 align:start position:0%

representative Bill King do you want to
 
02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
02:52:40.670 --> 02:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
motion yes I I want to start by saying
 
02:52:44.309 --> 02:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
that um I am a believer
 
02:52:47.590 --> 02:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
in climate change in environmental
 
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
impacts that are Happ happening from the
 
02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
climate change so um my my objection to
 
02:52:55.950 --> 02:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with that um
 
02:52:59.309 --> 02:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
I will also note that uh climate change
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
has been happening ever since Noah's
 
02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
flood but uh it has definitely increased
 
02:53:09.309 --> 02:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
in recent years um uh the objection I
 
02:53:13.710 --> 02:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
have to this bill is that um I think
 
02:53:16.990 --> 02:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
that it's going to overtax uh DHHS
 
02:53:19.150 --> 02:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
they're already involved in a lot lot of
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
different uh things within the state and
 
02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
um uh and actually somebody who came to
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
speak for the bill actually convinced me
 
02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
not to vote for the bill and it was uh
 
02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
somebody who had a not for-profit and is
 
02:53:37.070 --> 02:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
doing a very very good job coming up
 
02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
with Solutions and so my my I think my a
 
02:53:44.710 --> 02:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
lot of times we agree on the premise of
 
02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
a bill and we've heard a lot of that
 
02:53:50.190 --> 02:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
this morning already and yet we don't
 
02:53:52.990 --> 02:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
agree on the solution so I think the
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
solution is to actually have not for
 
02:53:57.389 --> 02:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
profits look at this rather than having
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
state and government look into um trying
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
to come up with a solution for us and
 
02:54:06.190 --> 02:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I would like to iil this
 
02:54:09.070 --> 02:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
bill he other discussion representative
 
02:54:11.429 --> 02:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
um Merchant then representative Shapiro
 
02:54:14.190 --> 02:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair also I concur with
 
02:54:17.590 --> 02:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
what representative uh Bill King said I
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
looked at the bill there's no funding
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
mechanism in this bill and given the
 
02:54:23.630 --> 02:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
fact that the Department of Health Human
 
02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
Services being on the oversight
 
02:54:29.389 --> 02:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee it does a gallant effort to
 
02:54:32.070 --> 02:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish what we ask it to accomplish
 
02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
to ask them to do more things with no
 
02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
funds it's almost like an unfunded
 
02:54:39.309 --> 02:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
mandate to the department I think it's
 
02:54:40.830 --> 02:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
unfair to the department I think at this
 
02:54:42.750 --> 02:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
point in time I do believe in the bill I
 
02:54:44.150 --> 02:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
just oppose it because there's no
 
02:54:45.870 --> 02:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for the Department to
 
02:54:47.510 --> 02:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
have the resources to accomplish exactly
 
02:54:49.349 --> 02:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
what we're asking it to accomplish I
 
02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
know it says they can have grants and so
 
02:54:53.229 --> 02:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
forth out there um Department could do
 
02:54:55.030 --> 02:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
that on its own without legislative
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
Authority um I just for those reasons I
 
02:54:59.590 --> 02:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to support the bill I'll
 
02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
support the the motion to
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
itl other discussion representative
 
02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes I'm going to vote against
 
02:55:11.469 --> 02:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
itl um well at the same time I
 
02:55:15.070 --> 02:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
understand some of the reasoning um that
 
02:55:18.670 --> 02:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
itl is being considered first I think um
 
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
seems accurate to me that um the
 
02:55:22.590 --> 02:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
could already do this without
 
02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislation in fact I think we heard
 
02:55:29.229 --> 02:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that they are doing this in in
 
02:55:30.670 --> 02:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
many respects they talked about
 
02:55:34.150 --> 02:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
tickborne illnesses and keeping data on
 
02:55:37.870 --> 02:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
certain um Health outcomes that might be
 
02:55:41.389 --> 02:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
related to climate I just for myself
 
02:55:44.110 --> 02:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
personally I just feel like we are the
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
are the health and human services
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee um and we should send a strong
 
02:55:52.950 --> 02:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
message that we think that climate
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
should be taken into consideration in
 
02:55:57.550 --> 02:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the future health of our state
 
02:55:57.560 --> 02:55:58.510 align:start position:0%
terms of the future health of our state
and

02:55:58.510 --> 02:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:01.710 --> 02:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um unlike representative
 
02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
King there are a lot of people who
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely do not believe this is an
 
02:56:09.429 --> 02:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
issue so I think as the subject matter
 
02:56:12.190 --> 02:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
committee um this is an opportunity for
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
at least me to to to take a stand and
 
02:56:17.870 --> 02:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
send a message that this is important
 
02:56:22.349 --> 02:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
and should be looked at um as much as
 
02:56:24.910 --> 02:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
possible uh representative Weber then
 
02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:26.110 align:start position:0%
possible uh representative Weber then
representative

02:56:26.110 --> 02:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:56:29.870 --> 02:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr chairman I I share
 
02:56:32.990 --> 02:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of what was said by the two
 
02:56:35.950 --> 02:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
previous speakers um here's the way I
 
02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
come out on it as I read this bill it
 
02:56:41.110 --> 02:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a lot of
 
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
substance um it and and it certainly
 
02:56:48.429 --> 02:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any funding it does have um
 
02:56:51.150 --> 02:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
a direction to look for Grants and it is
 
02:56:54.190 --> 02:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
a position that did exist at one
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
point um I am going to vote against the
 
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
itl because I want to affirm the policy
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
in here but it's a close call for me um
 
02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:12.910 align:start position:0%
in here but it's a close call for me um
and

02:57:12.910 --> 02:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:16.269 --> 02:57:16.279 align:start position:0%
um I I I wish there was more substance
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
here I would be fighting a lot harder if
 
02:57:20.910 --> 02:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
there was more substance rather than
 
02:57:23.630 --> 02:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
less but I think it's a measure that
 
02:57:26.190 --> 02:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt and therefore I'm going to
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl because um I am for
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
supporting the underlying policy
 
02:57:35.990 --> 02:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative cofal thank you Mr
 
02:57:38.070 --> 02:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
chairman so I I I guess there were a
 
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
couple of examples that were brought up
 
02:57:40.870 --> 02:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
when we asked sort of what would this
 
02:57:43.389 --> 02:57:43.399 align:start position:0%
position do what would it focus on and
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
the three that I recall um related to uh
 
02:57:49.830 --> 02:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
warning people or informing people uh
 
02:57:53.070 --> 02:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
regarding tickborne ill illnesses uh the
 
02:57:55.990 --> 02:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
second one had to do with uh wildfires
 
02:57:59.630 --> 02:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
in Canada and the the smoke that was uh
 
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
was drifting down into New England and
 
02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
the third had to do with educating
 
02:58:05.389 --> 02:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
people about heat related injuries like
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
heat stroke um I don't understand why we
 
02:58:12.790 --> 02:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
need a separate position to do any of
 
02:58:15.150 --> 02:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
those things I don't understand why any
 
02:58:17.150 --> 02:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
of those things would be outside of the
 
02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
purview of the Department currently um
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that by um authorizing
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
this position or you know even with or
 
02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
without funding we are we are
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
essentially creating a a a hole that the
 
02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
next legislature is going to need to
 
02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
fill um with with funding um so I think
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
the the for me the the debate is not um
 
02:58:48.070 --> 02:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
how any of us necessarily feels about CL
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
CL change per se the debate is um is is
 
02:58:54.750 --> 02:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
this is this necessary is it effective
 
02:58:57.349 --> 02:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
um does it does it really do anything
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
and as far as I can tell um there's
 
02:59:04.750 --> 02:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
nothing that this bill would enable that
 
02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
already possible as an activity per se
 
02:59:12.309 --> 02:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
not I'm not speaking of to to a position
 
02:59:14.710 --> 02:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
but um there's nothing there's nothing
 
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill says we should do that we
 
02:59:23.349 --> 02:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:26.469 --> 02:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
department the discussion
 
02:59:30.510 --> 02:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
representa uh thank you Mr chair uh I
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't uh agree on premises of this bill
 
02:59:37.630 --> 02:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
and specifically on future actions and
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
legislations that uh this uh uh
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
legislation would enable uh because uh
 
02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
those policies can and will backfire
 
02:59:51.510 --> 02:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
um for example we have problems with
 
02:59:54.910 --> 02:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
sticks but uh if green policies allow
 
02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
more forest and high deer population
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
High de population brings more tis uh we
 
03:00:03.469 --> 03:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
do have a risk in New Hampshire from
 
03:00:06.870 --> 03:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
future hurricanes but if we allow more
 
03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
trees that will uh eventually fall on
 
03:00:14.469 --> 03:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
houses uh it will backfire uh if we put
 
03:00:16.990 --> 03:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
our Emergency Services on electrical
 
03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:18.469 align:start position:0%
our Emergency Services on electrical
vehicles

03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
03:00:23.309 --> 03:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
uh and states around us uh threaten our
 
03:00:26.590 --> 03:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh energy Supply by enabling green
 
03:00:29.229 --> 03:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
energy policies we will end up with
 
03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles not able to serve us
 
03:00:36.429 --> 03:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
so I'm afraid about uh consequences of
 
03:00:36.439 --> 03:00:38.510 align:start position:0%
so I'm afraid about uh consequences of
such

03:00:38.510 --> 03:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
such
 
03:00:41.349 --> 03:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
legislation okay any other
 
03:00:44.030 --> 03:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lon uh thank
 
03:00:48.030 --> 03:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um my questions arise on
 
03:00:49.950 --> 03:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
on um the fact that this can be done
 
03:00:50.950 --> 03:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Health and
 
03:00:52.950 --> 03:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services and then how much
 
03:00:55.349 --> 03:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
validity this would give to a National
 
03:00:57.469 --> 03:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
Climate emergency that may be declared
 
03:00:59.349 --> 03:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
by the White House and whether or not
 
03:01:01.389 --> 03:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
the commissioner needs to take actions
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
for that National Climate emergency
 
03:01:05.830 --> 03:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
under the more broad-reaching authority
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner of the Department of
 
03:01:09.630 --> 03:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services relative to
 
03:01:11.550 --> 03:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
other Commissioners and other other
 
03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
people in the executive branch other
 
03:01:16.950 --> 03:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
than the governor um we we have to look
 
03:01:18.269 --> 03:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
at whether we're trying to to look at
 
03:01:20.429 --> 03:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
first and second order causes or third
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
and fourth order causes we have our
 
03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
issues with tickborne diseases and
 
03:01:27.269 --> 03:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
regardless about what causation we have
 
03:01:29.389 --> 03:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
we know that Lyme disease is an issue we
 
03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
know that some of these other that may
 
03:01:32.670 --> 03:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
make my life miserable if I become
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
allergic to meat end up moving here into
 
03:01:38.349 --> 03:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I think that trying to
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
get into those second third fourth order
 
03:01:43.750 --> 03:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
causes just really dilutes the effort
 
03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
because we task the Department of Health
 
03:01:47.550 --> 03:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
and Human Services with doing so many
 
03:01:49.950 --> 03:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
different things this is something where
 
03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
we have experts all over that are
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
collecting data we have guidelines that
 
03:01:55.870 --> 03:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
are coming from other areas the idea of
 
03:01:58.670 --> 03:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
trying to collect and analyze data we
 
03:02:00.910 --> 03:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
have um on another bill um collecting
 
03:02:03.389 --> 03:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
and analyzing data relative to um
 
03:02:05.349 --> 03:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization that one's costing
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
$200,000 a year because we have some of
 
03:02:09.630 --> 03:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
the collection costs and then we have a
 
03:02:11.190 --> 03:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
salary cost that's over
 
03:02:13.510 --> 03:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
$100,000 if we're not going to fund this
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
then we get into other challenges and
 
03:02:18.309 --> 03:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
the more unfunded positions we have the
 
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
more challenges we run into because we
 
03:02:22.269 --> 03:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
ask the department to do something and
 
03:02:24.510 --> 03:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
then we don't give them the resources um
 
03:02:26.750 --> 03:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
I know that I personally apologized
 
03:02:29.630 --> 03:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
after working to pass a bill last term
 
03:02:31.950 --> 03:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
that we should have funded um and we had
 
03:02:33.590 --> 03:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
to come back through this entire process
 
03:02:35.910 --> 03:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
with 1669 to make sure that we had the
 
03:02:37.830 --> 03:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
funds necessary for the Department to do
 
03:02:40.590 --> 03:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
their job so the idea of doing this and
 
03:02:42.870 --> 03:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
moving forward on this I I I just don't
 
03:02:45.910 --> 03:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
think is a good use of State resources
 
03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
when we have so many other areas that
 
03:02:50.590 --> 03:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
are more pressing need that are more
 
03:02:53.070 --> 03:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
directly related to the efforts here in
 
03:02:54.990 --> 03:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
the state you know everything else we're
 
03:02:57.870 --> 03:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
doing to address Health will'll already
 
03:02:59.710 --> 03:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
address these areas which are trending
 
03:03:02.550 --> 03:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
and becoming more prevalent and um I
 
03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
just want to keep us Mission focused on
 
03:03:06.269 --> 03:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
health and you know perhaps let
 
03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
environment and a or resources whoever
 
03:03:09.950 --> 03:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
deals with more of the climate change
 
03:03:12.349 --> 03:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
issues worry about that because
 
03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
regardless of of what's changing the
 
03:03:15.830 --> 03:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
prevalence of different diseases we
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
focus on the health um we have other
 
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
other other committees that deal with
 
03:03:23.229 --> 03:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
more of the climate change
 
03:03:26.269 --> 03:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
issues other
 
03:03:29.429 --> 03:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm seeing none before I put
 
03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
the question to the committee uh I don't
 
03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
know exactly where this is going to end
 
03:03:36.670 --> 03:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
up um but three of us excuse me four of
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
us are do an Edna on another bill in 15
 
03:03:42.389 --> 03:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
minutes and in the event that we go to a
 
03:03:44.469 --> 03:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
second vote on this it's going to be
 
03:03:47.070 --> 03:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
calling it a little tight so before I
 
03:03:48.510 --> 03:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
put the question I'm thinking that
 
03:03:50.309 --> 03:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative Murphy you and I
 
03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
and representative TZ and representative
 
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
Nagel should go on to Edna uh on another
 
03:03:58.910 --> 03:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill it's a it's it's Senate Bill 440 we
 
03:04:00.510 --> 03:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
at one point we thought it might come to
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
this committee it's only going to them
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
but um I I don't want to be late for
 
03:04:09.469 --> 03:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
that so um I'm just thinking in the
 
03:04:11.870 --> 03:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
event this goes to a second vote uh and
 
03:04:14.910 --> 03:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
it get be a split vote might be safer to
 
03:04:16.830 --> 03:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
as representative Maguire I he runs a
 
03:04:20.309 --> 03:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
pretty tight ship Miss representative of
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
can we do a straw poll um sure couldn't
 
03:04:25.710 --> 03:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
we just take the first vote and then
 
03:04:27.750 --> 03:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
we'll know where we are it will take us
 
03:04:29.389 --> 03:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
three minutes oh okay and then and then
 
03:04:31.150 --> 03:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have to the people for the
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
first vote wouldn't have to S around for
 
03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
the stick around for the second vote
 
03:04:35.950 --> 03:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying everybody can go on mass
 
03:04:38.830 --> 03:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
if they need to yeah okay all right all
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
right in that case um representative
 
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
Bill King has made a motion of
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
itl uh on Senate Bill 496 FN and I'll
 
03:04:51.070 --> 03:04:51.080 align:start position:0%

03:06:12.630 --> 03:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
okay I assume they'll be a Minority
 
03:06:15.870 --> 03:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
Report uh we'll we'll discuss among
 
03:06:17.790 --> 03:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves but we understand you need did
 
03:06:19.950 --> 03:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
this afternoon okay great thank you very
 
03:06:22.590 --> 03:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
much um and I would just with the last
 
03:06:26.229 --> 03:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
one I abjure my colleagues that when you
 
03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
have the votes stop talking and
 
03:06:29.710 --> 03:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
representative Le on when I said that
 
03:06:31.229 --> 03:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
the first time said and when you don't
 
03:06:36.150 --> 03:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
have the votes stop talking so um I
 
03:06:38.670 --> 03:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
should have probably said that
 
03:06:50.229 --> 03:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll just make a note there will
 
03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you okay and with that uh the
 
03:07:03.550 --> 03:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
next bill could go on a bit I know
 
03:07:05.790 --> 03:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
that's a a little bit of a contentious
 
03:07:08.790 --> 03:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
issue on um those those pills those
 
03:07:11.469 --> 03:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
contraception pills so I think it would
 
03:07:13.550 --> 03:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
be a good time uh for the four of us to
 
03:07:16.150 --> 03:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
go on to Edna again it's two Republicans
 
03:07:18.110 --> 03:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
and two Democrats
 
03:07:22.590 --> 03:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
so um you folks want to join me uh and
 
03:07:24.750 --> 03:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
I'll leave the gabble with the vice
 
03:07:27.389 --> 03:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you madam Vice
 
03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um and with that I
 
03:07:32.790 --> 03:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
will open the executive session on
 
03:07:34.590 --> 03:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
03:07:37.070 --> 03:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
567 and uh representative mizor do you
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:07:40.110 --> 03:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you madam chair I'd
 
03:07:43.349 --> 03:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
like to motion to itl and I'll second
 
03:07:48.269 --> 03:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
that sorry sorry on SB 567
 
03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll second that would you like
 
03:07:53.710 --> 03:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yes um it's
 
03:07:56.590 --> 03:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
just confusing and honestly concerning
 
03:07:58.269 --> 03:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
why we're singling out just these two
 
03:08:00.950 --> 03:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
drugs for a report why not compile a
 
03:08:03.469 --> 03:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
report on the availabil availability of
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
other drugs and um we have no real data
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
to show that this is an actual problem
 
03:08:12.670 --> 03:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why I I don't see the need for
 
03:08:12.680 --> 03:08:13.349 align:start position:0%
so that's why I I don't see the need for
this

03:08:13.349 --> 03:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:08:17.710 --> 03:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you uh representative Weber
 
03:08:21.910 --> 03:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I see a need
 
03:08:27.870 --> 03:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
for the study because of the increased
 
03:08:31.229 --> 03:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
attacks on the availability of various
 
03:08:35.830 --> 03:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
sorts of reproductive health care and we
 
03:08:39.229 --> 03:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
know that in this state we have places
 
03:08:42.030 --> 03:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
where there is less Health Care rather
 
03:08:44.990 --> 03:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
than more and so I would very much like
 
03:08:47.710 --> 03:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
to see this report done thank you thank
 
03:08:50.790 --> 03:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Merchant
 
03:08:54.190 --> 03:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important that we
 
03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
collect sort of
 
03:09:00.910 --> 03:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
a landscape of what's happening in the
 
03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
state in regards to the availability of
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
these medications I would also say that
 
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
this could be done without going through
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh a legislative process if the
 
03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
department wanted to do this they could
 
03:09:12.590 --> 03:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
do it today work with a Board of Nursing
 
03:09:15.070 --> 03:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy um Board of Medicine
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
places in which the data could be
 
03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
collected today with going through a
 
03:09:20.830 --> 03:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
legislative process so I don't say
 
03:09:22.830 --> 03:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
support the bill because I think is are
 
03:09:24.830 --> 03:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Avenues to gain the data without
 
03:09:26.670 --> 03:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
having to go through a legislative
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
process thank you representative Weber
 
03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then representative Seth
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
King and I would just say that it is our
 
03:09:37.630 --> 03:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
purview as a legislator as a legislature
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
and as individual legislators to direct
 
03:09:44.269 --> 03:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
the department as to what information we
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
would like to have gathered uh because
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
while they have the ability to do so
 
03:09:51.150 --> 03:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
they also have as we've said a number of
 
03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
times before many other things that they
 
03:09:56.190 --> 03:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
are also doing so I think this is a
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
matter of policy for the legislature and
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
I think that um I will be voting in
 
03:10:04.150 --> 03:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
favor of the underlying
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
chair is it Madam chair my
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
apologies okay thank you madam chair and
 
03:10:17.870 --> 03:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the correction um
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
this build um I just think it sets a bad
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
precedent um I mean how how would we
 
03:10:28.110 --> 03:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
feel if all of a sudden the gun rights
 
03:10:30.269 --> 03:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
people decided to say we need to have a
 
03:10:32.190 --> 03:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
bill we need to have a report on the
 
03:10:34.670 --> 03:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
availability of guns in North Country
 
03:10:36.510 --> 03:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
because there's an attack on gun rights
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
all across the United States and there
 
03:10:39.870 --> 03:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
just might not be enough people to you
 
03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
know I mean we could play this game for
 
03:10:45.070 --> 03:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
so many different
 
03:10:48.790 --> 03:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
ideas and this isn't achieve anything if
 
03:10:50.349 --> 03:10:50.359 align:start position:0%
if these people if people want these
 
03:10:53.229 --> 03:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
drugs they can get them and this is this
 
03:10:58.510 --> 03:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
is more like a a statement than anything
 
03:11:00.830 --> 03:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
real and I just I don't want to see us
 
03:11:02.910 --> 03:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
go down that path so I'll be voting itl
 
03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:03.710 align:start position:0%
go down that path so I'll be voting itl
thank

03:11:03.710 --> 03:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
you um thank you and I'll speak briefly
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
to this um I I think that conflating
 
03:11:10.910 --> 03:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening in New Hampshire with
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the rest of the
 
03:11:14.469 --> 03:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
country is a dangerous idea here in New
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that the six week that
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
we have is one that many people can
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
agree upon um I know that when I'm
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
speaking when people come to me and say
 
03:11:27.389 --> 03:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
I'm pro-choice where are you um the six
 
03:11:29.070 --> 03:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
month is something that's rational to
 
03:11:31.070 --> 03:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
them the state of New Hampshire even
 
03:11:32.670 --> 03:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
though there are a few legislators who
 
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
are putting in very early bills those
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
are soundly defeated New Hampshire is a
 
03:11:39.630 --> 03:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
very different state than some of the
 
03:11:43.190 --> 03:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
other states within this Union um and
 
03:11:45.429 --> 03:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
quite frankly it appears that the prime
 
03:11:47.309 --> 03:11:47.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill may have an ability
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
to look at this at the federal level if
 
03:11:51.070 --> 03:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh she's successful but I don't think
 
03:11:52.950 --> 03:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
that this is really necessary to the
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so that's why I
 
03:11:58.349 --> 03:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
seconded it so S I don't know if there's
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
any other discussion or if we want to I
 
03:12:01.790 --> 03:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
guess we want to make sure that
 
03:12:03.389 --> 03:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
everybody who should be in here is
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
actually here if we do call a vote so
 
03:12:08.990 --> 03:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:13.150 --> 03:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
check3 14 that's 16 16 minus 4 means
 
03:12:14.550 --> 03:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're only missing the people that we
 
03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
were counting on not being here perfect
 
03:12:17.760 --> 03:12:19.630 align:start position:0%
were counting on not being here perfect

355 I I think we finished 3 no
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation on 350 oh we okay I was

yes thank you sorry about that Madam
 
03:14:43.309 --> 03:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
chair representative South K yeah I'd

like to say a quick quick apology
 
03:14:48.790 --> 03:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say a quick apology for
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
earlier when I called the vaccine stupid
 
03:14:52.870 --> 03:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
that came off as unnecessarily harsh
 
03:14:56.830 --> 03:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
that was not my intention so sorry thank
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
you for that thank
 
03:15:02.190 --> 03:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
you um and we will see everybody bright
 
03:15:04.590 --> 03:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
and early tomorrow I'm not sure we'll
 
03:15:06.830 --> 03:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
see which time we're noticed for um as
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:14.309 --> 03:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
9:30 um the because it's that we're
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
hearing the bill the same day so um we
 
03:15:18.269 --> 03:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
do not need to notice as long as there's
 
03:15:19.389 --> 03:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
agreement between the chair and the
 
03:15:21.309 --> 03:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
ranking member there's already agreement
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
between the chair and the ranking member
 
03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
um the the biggest question though is I
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
know that some people will be getting up
 
03:15:29.189 --> 03:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
to testify in other bills um we'll just
 
03:15:30.870 --> 03:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
need to figure out how we accommodate
 
03:15:34.150 --> 03:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
that in order to accommodate our subs um
 
03:15:36.510 --> 03:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
and representative Weber and I would
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
remind people that the sponsors don't
 
03:15:40.189 --> 03:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
actually have to be there if you have
 
03:15:40.199 --> 03:15:41.429 align:start position:0%
actually have to be there if you have
somebody

03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
else have them bring your remarks and
 
03:15:47.150 --> 03:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
your sentiments
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
um but be here for the vote if you
 
03:15:52.710 --> 03:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
possibly can uh but but that having been
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
said you know I think it's an important
 
03:15:56.950 --> 03:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
bill there was an inadvertent error and
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think it behoves all of us to
 
03:16:01.990 --> 03:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
cooperate in in coming to a resolution
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
and it's also a second committee bill so
 
03:16:06.710 --> 03:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you for that and also um
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
this morning those bills had very slim
 
03:16:10.349 --> 03:16:10.359 align:start position:0%
representation in that and we wanted to
 
03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
make sure our hard work didn't go um
