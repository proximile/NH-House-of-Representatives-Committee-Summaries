00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you chairman makoni uh I
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
hope your knuckles are not as white uh
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes as they are right now
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I am Tom Corman I'm
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh from Grafton 15 which
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
is the city of Lebanon ward 3 I was a
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
professor at Dartmouth for 29 and a half
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
years which is relevant to this bill
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill because the way this bill came
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
about was during our onewe filing period
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
back in September I was in town doing an
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
erand and I ran into a staff member I
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
knew at Dartmouth I told her hey I'm a
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative now and we're filing
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
bills and she said I ride a
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and grass clippings in the
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
road present a road hazard they make the
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
road slippery and people can skit out
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
and as soon as she said that I
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
remembered from my senior year at
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
college one of my good friends was
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
riding a motorcycle and he slipped out
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
on grass clippings and collapsed a lung
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
so I figured yeah let me file a bill on
 
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:43.759 align:start position:0%
that I contacted OS to ask is there uh a
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
statute against yard debris and Brass
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
clippings in the road and they said no
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
they referred me to an ordinance from
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
Nashua which is what I modeled this bill
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
on so this bill says that no person or
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
Agency State or local agency shall
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
direct grass clippings or or guard
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
debris uh yeah yard debris more than two
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
feet into any paved class one two three
 
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
four or five
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
Highway and the reason I chose two feet
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not really a motorcycle rider but I
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
am a bicyclist and I thought well
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
especially for a motorcycle if you're
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
more than two if you're if you're less
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
than two feet from the edge you're
 
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
probably a little too close to the edge
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
anyway and I think people do need to be
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
able to have some slack as to where
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
their yard debris and grass clippings
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
are going if you're mowing your grass
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
clippings are going to go various places
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
and it seems like know not at all into
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
the road is a little little harsh so I
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
picked two feet I don't know if that's
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
really the right amount but that's
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's what I picked um and that's
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
really what it's about it's a a public
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
safety meure measure designed to make
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
life a little better for motorcyclists
 
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.430 align:start position:0%
life a little better for motorcyclists
and

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
bicyclists you'll notice that one of the
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors is the speaker and why is
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
the speaker a co-sponsor when I was
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
looking for co-sponsors I was thinking
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
who do I know in the legislature who
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
rides a motorcycle and I know the
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
speaker rides a motorcycle I asked the
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
speaker if he was interested in
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring and he agreed to
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor so with that
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative Jack
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Corman um I assume
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere in RSA 265 the is the penalty
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
for violating this
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
section yes in fact I'm looking that up
 
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.829 align:start position:0%
section yes in fact I'm looking that up
right

00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.430 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
yes um so it's a violation if a natural
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
person or guilty of of a misdemeanor if
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
person further further questions yes
 
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.949 align:start position:0%
person further further questions yes
please

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
coming does this doesn't affect Town
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
Road I beg your pardon does this Bill
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
affect town
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
roads um well it affects roads that are
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
class 1 through five highways and most
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
town roads I believe are in that
 
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
category okay then a little bit of a
 
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.750 align:start position:0%
category okay then a little bit of a
problem

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
because if the forest comes up to the
 
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
side of the
 
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
road like this year in particular they
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
Dro thousands of pine cones branches
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
that who's going to pick it up to get it
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
off the road Road who's going to be
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
charged with a
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
Mis and the the other concept is further
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
question second
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
question there's a lot of people that
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
get their trash picked up and they put
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
it in barrels and stuff and they push it
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
out onto the
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
road and uh that's more than two
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
feet is that going to apply as
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question the the
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh text of the bill says that no person
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
shall place or direct placement so if
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
something is falling from a tree it
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't been directed by a person so I
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
understand that you know stuff Falls
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
from trees but this is really about you
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
or your neighbor putting things into the
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
road rather than than the nature putting
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
things into the road we we can't control
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
nature the second question um when when
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
people are are putting their their trash
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
or recycling out it's in a container
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
right and and that that would not really
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
be yard debris placed into the road that
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
would be in a container okay so that
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply I I would not interpret
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
that as applying because certainly from
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
the point of view of the intent of this
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
bill that is not going to cause a a uh
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
traction Hazard for anybody on a two
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
wheel vehicle okay thank you thank you
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
representative please thank
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
you I know some municipalities and
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
certainly private contractors in the
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
process of picking up you know doing
 
00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:41.270 align:start position:0%
process of picking up you know doing
yard

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
yard
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
cleanup push their leaves and grass out
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
to the street and then pick it up with a
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
you know machine that sucks it up and
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
throws it into a
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
truck uh I you know I don't know if that
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
two feet is going to do it and I'm
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
wondering if you thought about
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
instead of measuring it two feet from
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
the side of the road measuring a clear
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
distance from the center line that would
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
still you provide safety I mean I think
 
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.710 align:start position:0%
still you provide safety I mean I think
if

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's you know 8 feet you know if that
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
would still allow four feet or so at
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
least on the side of the road for with
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
these normal Leaf pick up operations is
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
that that something that might work into
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you for the
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
question I could see something like that
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
the reason I thought about the distance
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
from the side of the road rather than
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
from the center is a homeowner can
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
easily judge two feet from the side of
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
the road getting the right number of
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
feet from the center especially for a
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
large Road might be a little more
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
challenging um I also felt like uh again
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of if you're getting
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
closer than 2 feet you're probably a
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
little too close to to the edge and
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's the really the way that I thought
 
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.390 align:start position:0%
that's the really the way that I thought
about

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
it thank you represent
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
Melvin uh thank you thank you for taking
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
my question could you tell me how uh
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to enforce this or how it
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
enforced I would imagine it would be
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
enforced the same way
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
as the other statutes in chapter
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
265 are
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
enforced um
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
how that is done I don't know if it's
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
done by municipality or state but
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
however that's enforced this would be in
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
addition represent Boger I'm sorry
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
followup please so you believe that the
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities are going to go out there
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
and take care of this every time there's
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
a complaint I would imagine that that
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
could happen yes thank you thank you
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
both rent
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
berer I have like two questions please
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
go right
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
ahead the the first
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
question a class five Road usually is a
 
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.549 align:start position:0%
question a class five Road usually is a
dirt

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
dirt
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
road so what is the purpose of a dirt
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
class five dirt road being brought into
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
a bill when it's not open usually for
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
public traffic and you normally
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
transverse a class five Road at your own
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
risk that's question one I'll let you go
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
ahead and answer that one oh thank you
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh well the bill
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
specifies paved roads so if there were a
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
paved class five road then the bill
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
would apply I specifically did not
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
intended to apply to unpaved roads of
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
any class again uh thinking that the
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
traction on an unpaved road is going to
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
be uncertain anyway and somebody who's
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
on a motorcycle or a bicycle on that
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
road should be cognizant of that my
 
00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
concern is more of I'm on a paved Road
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
I'm expecting traction suddenly I hit
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
this debris or grass clippings and I
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
traction second question thank you um
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
would you believe this is going to a uh
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
open up neighborhood disputes now
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
between neighbors because one neighbor
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't like another neighbor now
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to pick on glass clippings
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't quantify how much GL
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
grass clippings could be in the road it
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
just says grass clippings so that could
 
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
be just a little handful anywhere to a
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
tremulous amount of a drunk truck load
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it doesn't quantify how much
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
that is and would this also turn into
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate on local cities to
 
00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:45.350 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate on local cities to
start

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
policing people and how they cut their
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
grass thank you I really can't say uh
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
the way I think of it is
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
that if somebody is being really agreed
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
I about it I could imagine a neighbor
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
complaining um if somebody puts you know
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
three Blades of grass two feet and one
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
inch into a road and their neighbor
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
complains I'm guessing that there were
 
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799 align:start position:0%
issues already that were going on and
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be something
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
new thank you um seeing no please
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
do have an issue with the amount that
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
has to be in this for it to be
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
enforced is there anywhere in 26512
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
where it says when a traction Hazard
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
exists then a penalty or fee can be
 
00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
charged because I can think of a lot of
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
situations where somebody goes to work
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
for the day and they put stuff by the
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
road to be picked up and the wind comes
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
up and it blows it across the road now
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
they get a summon they get a ticket for
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
something they really didn't have a
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
great responsibility to do anything
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
about it was the weather that did that
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
so is there
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere either we could put in this or
 
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.590 align:start position:0%
anywhere either we could put in this or
in

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
26512 where traction traction Hazard
 
00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
comes up that they can use that and
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully use Good's judgment whether or
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
not they file a summons or give somebody
 
00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:25.230 align:start position:0%
not they file a summons or give somebody
a

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
citation thank you
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
it certainly is possible that somebody
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
has put grass clippings a foot into the
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
road the wind comes up and blows it a
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
little farther uh of course at that
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
point it wasn't the person who caused it
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
to be placed but you raised a good point
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
that and and I don't really know the
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
um if the commit the bill belongs to the
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
committee now and if the committee
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
wishes to amend the bill to specify a
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
law subraction or the the potential for
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
a loss of traction I think that makes
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
sense um my concern here really is is
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
the public safety aspect of it that that
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
we don't want people on especially two-
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
wheel vehicles to lose traction and skit
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
out and be
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
hurt thank you representative um any
 
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing no further
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will move to uh
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
Transportation Michael service do I have
 
00:26:30.399 --> 00:26:39.230 align:start position:0%
Transportation Michael service do I have
welcome

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
sir good morning chairman Maki uh and
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
is Michael citus I am the director of
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
operations at the Department of
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you for hearing my
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding house build um 1379
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
relative to yard uh yard debris and
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
roadside vegetation
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
the department does not support or
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill however we do have a lot
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
of concerns it's understood that the
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is to improve safety
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
in the traveling public the deity is
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about the current language and
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
its un unintended consequences it may
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
create the do staff believe the problem
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks to remedy is already
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
covered in RSA
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
23639 civil liabilities which addresses
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
the placement of any type of material on
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
the Highway which renders the highway
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
unsuitable for public travel the
 
00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation does not
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
support allowing any amount of debris or
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
yard waste being placed in the state
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
right away but particularly encroaching
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
into the paved section of a roadway many
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
state highways have a pave width of only
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
24 to 26 feet allowing debris to
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
encroach two feet into the pavement can
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
significantly impact mobility and safety
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
in that area we are concerned that the
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
way the bill is written it may may cause
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
confusion encourage some people to place
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
material in the right away and onto the
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
pavement for pickup disposal by others
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
while there are many times the
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation may pull
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
brush close to the roadway it is with
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of chipping loading and trans
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
uh transporting from the area in a very
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
short time frame this would be for
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
material generated from within the
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
RightWay itself the department is
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
currently strained to remove and dispose
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
of this material it generates for RO
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
outside maintenance it does not have the
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
capacity to take on generated waste from
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
others debris piles along the roadway
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
can also block and divert uh drainage
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
which can have disastrous results that
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
we have recently seen when drainage
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
systems are overwhelmed and they run off
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
diverts to paths they are not designed
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
to flow this can damage roadways as well
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
as the surrounding area in conclusion
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
while the department understands the
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
intent and we are certain uh we are
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about the Bill's language and
 
00:28:59.950 --> 00:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences that may
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
bring to the highway system thank you
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
for listening to my testimony and I'd be
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
committee yes
 
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chamman and thank
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i' I've got
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
an example I've got a 8in culet at the
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
end of my driveway that's City owned and
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
we all know we had this big rainstorm
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
and everything backed up well the covet
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
was full of leaves
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
the leaves came down from the neighbors
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
and ended up there so I went out there
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
put my boots on and I went out there and
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
took a rake and I rake the leaves to the
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
side of the road cuz the road is right
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
there the the road is right where the
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
cul is could I under this law could I be
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
charged for trying to clear a celv out
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
that the city owns So my side of the
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
road wouldn't get flooded out with those
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
result uh I guess I can't weigh too much
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
of that but the way it's
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
listed um if you had the new the new law
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
you would be able to put it out within
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
two feet but again if they're not picked
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
up anytime soon they're going to go back
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
into the ditch and that's one of our our
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
concerns is you know keeping those
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
ditches in that drainage way cleared and
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
by having more debris brought forward
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
into the RightWay and again even if it's
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
brought out to the into the uh edge of
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
pavement or onto the pavement that's
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to tend to block more drainage
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
paths thank you U thank you for the
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
question and um thank you sir for your
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%

committee hearings um I'm here in
 
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
support of the bill because one of the
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
reasons that this Force should be named
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
after Miss Kellogg is her involvement in
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
the state moose
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
plate um she was a uh Prime person
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
involved in that program where um money
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
was collected for elip I did speak with
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
Senator Martha Clark who is the who was
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill at the time and
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
she did confirm with me Miss Kellog's
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
involvement and we'll be happy to
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
provide remarks to the

committee so I'm here to um urge you to
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
support the bill um Miss Kellogg has
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
been a um conservationist her whole life
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and has contributed on
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
a state level which is why I think the
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
force is this BL Forest which is cont
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
which is slowly held in the town of
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
Campton should be named after her and
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%

you R did you uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh this committee has a practice of not
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
raming something that's already named
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
for someone so but uh reading the
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
material it looks as though it's not
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
actually named for something it's kind
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
of happened stance that it was on the
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
Blair's land so if someone at some point
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
one of the speakers could
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
address uh that concern ripping the name
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:41:03.030 align:start position:0%

hoit um regarding the Blair State Forest
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
I think you as I said well this has
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
already been passed around apparently
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's a small
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
Forest um it's very well maintained in
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
fact when I was at school at Plymouth
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
State College many years
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
ago my conservation teacher Dr Fry
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
brought us specifically to the Blair
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
state Forest to show what a very
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
well-maintained Forest is like so I'm
 
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
very familiar with the
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
forest there aren't really aren't any
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
Trails there's a few hundred feet on the
 
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.670 align:start position:0%
Trails there's a few hundred feet on the
Blair

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
Blair
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
Road uh no River
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
Frontage no parking I think you could
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
pull off on the side of the
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
road um and there's a small wooden
 
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.470 align:start position:0%
road um and there's a small wooden
sign

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
sign
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's
 
00:42:59.470 --> 00:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
the description of the State Forest
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:17.559 align:start position:0%

00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
the students contacted the Bureau of

Motor Vehicles in in every state to see
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
if they had a conservation program and
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
to get information about it there were
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
12 States at the time that did Jane led
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
the students to create a program along
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%

00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me and all the process to develop
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
the final legislation would take five
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
years Martha Fuller Clark would become
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
the instrumental in mentoring and
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
shaping the program into a conservation

strong bond of our state's conservation
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
and Heritage the students remained

involved throughout the
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
process there would always be students
 
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
who would join Jane for legislative work
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
sessions Jane remains proud of her
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
women and probably most importantly
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
whether they were all dead or
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
not um so I assured her that not all of
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
them were dead
 
00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
so uh she was uh reassured about that
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
but uh it reminded me her reluctance to
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
a certain extent REM reminded me of
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.190 align:start position:0%
um the
movie

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
movie
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
Gladiator when the the chief of the
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
military was asked by Marcus
 
00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:10.430 align:start position:0%
military was asked by Marcus
aurelus

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
aurelus
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
to um run a take over for him when he
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
died and run Rome until he could give it
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
back to the Roman
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
people and his response was absolutely
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
not and Marcus
 
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
aurelus answered saying that's exactly
 
00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.470 align:start position:0%
aurelus answered saying that's exactly
why

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
you um you should be the person and I
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
think in the same sense I think
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
that uh I think Jane is the person that
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
should be should have this named after
 
00:50:44.359 --> 00:50:46.710 align:start position:0%
should be should have this named after
her

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
um another few observations there really
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
aren't very many women
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
named uh that have Forest named after
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
them in New
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think there were two donors
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
who donated the land and on the
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%

00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
Commission um I've been on the
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
commission for about two years and Jane
 
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
was really a uh reason why I joined the
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh the commission uh just her passion
 
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
for conservation and her energy on
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
projects um really led me to that uh
 
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
Jane and her career spanned about 25
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
years she's done thousands of projects
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh here and there educating the public
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh doing things but perhaps her biggest
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
contribution and from a Statewide
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
perspective has been the mov plate
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
program um that program is a large and
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
important fundraiser that provides
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
annual funds to protect and promote both
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
our environment and our cultural
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
heritage a very very key uh program uh
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
it all began when Jane was a teacher
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
back at the holdener central school back
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
in 93 her class was doing some research
 
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.589 align:start position:0%
in 93 her class was doing some research
on

00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
manatees uh around Florida and they
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
stumbled upon a license plate program
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
that stated Florida had in place to help
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
raise money for these manatees and of
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
course kids being uh Curious they said
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
well do we have anything like that in
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and of course uh they did
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
some research and no the answer came
 
00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
back and then another curious student
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
said well why can't we do that here and
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and that all
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
started and planted the seeds for the
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
Moose plate program so in the course of
 
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
the five years uh the Jane in the class
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
reached out to local rep Representatives
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
they wrote letters they appeared at
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
different hearings um Jane even brought
 
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
some of her students to hearings uh here
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
in conquer and the whole program began
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
to take shape now it took five years for
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
this to come to fruition um and in that
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
time her students had become ninth
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
graders uh but a lot of it was the
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
administrative uh workings to figure
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
that out um and also um it's sort of
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
shifted Focus from just focusing on
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
animals the Moose uh to also cultural uh
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
projects which was a big need here in
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire today residents can go to
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
any their town hall and get a moose
 
01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
car now I mentioned that this was a very
 
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
important fundraiser for the state um
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
all of the funds raised from this
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
special license plate going to the New
 
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:53.480 align:start position:0%

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.240 align:start position:0%

01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
each year they review all the
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
applications from conservation groups
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
historical churches uh different
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
Heritage restoration uh group seeking
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
grant money and then they allocate that
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
money uh to various groups now there's
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
some very eye popping figures from this
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
moose plate program that you might not
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
be aware of since Inception the program
 
01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
has raised more than $20
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
million that's really phenomenal and it
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
has funded over a thousand different
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
projects in two uh in this year alone
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
2024 over $670,000 are allocated for
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
both conservation and Heritage projects
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
and all these projects span across the
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
state in all 10 uh
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
counties the average Grant is around
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
$30,000 and that's really a substantial
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
 
projects

01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%

representing the I guess the town of
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%

Campton uh I'm also on the Conservation
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
Commission in Campton 2 um I've
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
submitted this you know the testimony
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
here and you know just you know the
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
testimony points to that you know Jane's
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
been involved at a state level she jumps
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
in things at a regional level too I
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody knows of Livermore
 
01:05:38.269 --> 01:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
Falls Regional Recreation Area it's a
 
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
state park it was not a state park
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
before Jane and the Plymouth rotary and
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
people got involved in it and um they
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
took a place that was 30% of the police
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
calls and holderness were because of
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
this this area being misused and now
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
it's a safe family oriented State Park
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
that U people are able to
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
enjoy Also Jane is the co-founder of the
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
Campton Conservation Commission and
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's you know for Campton that's um
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
been a huge um thing that's supported in
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
our community she's um it's resulted in
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
three conservation properties in Campton
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
and it has wide support in Campton but I
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
think also that you know this is a
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more than that too because is
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
um you know the US the constituents
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
asking for this renaming you know it's a
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
small forest and a small rural town and
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
um you know we wouldn't be asking this
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
because you know the forest is all
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
within the campon we wouldn't really be
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
asking this for like Livermore Falls
 
01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
state forest because that is encamped in
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
holderness so yes you know what we are
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
asking for is you know more
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
consideration that what might be
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise infored because it is all with
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
in the town of Campton so you know by
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
naming the state forest which is now
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know it's just a happened to
 
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:04.839 align:start position:0%
become Blair State Forest because it was
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
Blair it was a Blair parcel that the
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
person who deed it to the
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
state that's what he called it but he
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
was not a Blair he was not part of the
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
Blair family it's just because some of
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
the frontage you know a couple hundred
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
feet is on Blair Road and we have a lot
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
of stuff that you know was Blair but
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
that was early you know late 1800
 
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't deeded to to the state
 
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.269 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't deeded to to the state
until

01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
1924 so it is a state force it has a uh
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
Force management plan but it does not
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
have a conservation easement but the
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
stewards the state of New Hampshire are
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
very great stewards of that
 
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
land now um you know you know I
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're a small town you know
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
conservation is a big part of that keeps
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
the land conservation Wildlife
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
Conservation that keeps the rural
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
character of Campton and that is very
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
very important to the to the
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
residents almost
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
70% of Campton is protected land that is
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
either by State Forest which there's two
 
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
within Campton the wild uh the White
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
Mountain National Forest there's current
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
use as well as um conservation easement
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
properties we have both large and small
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
conservation easement properties within
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
Campton and at the you know at the same
 
01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
time because such a large percentage of
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
campon is under conserv or is protected
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
land that doesn't mean we don't see we
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
have a lot we support and have a lot of
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
development um um and also that um this
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
protected land doesn't mean it's off off
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
limits a lot of it actually is contrary
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's required to have access for
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
recreation so Hunting Fishing
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling and hiking
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
is allowed on most of this conservation
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
land and it is widely used for those
 
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.950 align:start position:0%
land and it is widely used for those
purposes

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
too so what we're what we're trying to
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
do here too is take this state forest
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
that's all within the state of Campton
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
and Link it to conservation and we can't
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
think of a better way of doing that than
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
through Jane and her lifetime of
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
conservation so I hope that you can you
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
know afford US you know uh you know the
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
consideration as being you know this is
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
a state force all within Campton and
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is Campton asking for it to be
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
renamed um so appreciate your time okay

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
you've all heard at the holderness
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
school who conceived or helped to
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
conceive with with the involvement of
 
01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
her students uh ultimately leading to
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
the establishment of the Moose plate
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
program while this is a very notable um
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
contribution on a Statewide level uh the
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
majority of Miss Kellogg's conservation
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
accomplishments that were shared with me
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
in a letter from the Conservation
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
Commission appear to be largely at the
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
local level and I don't this is no
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
disrespect Miss Kellogg or her
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
supporters in Campton clearly she's a
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
conservation leader
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
but it's our job to to
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
weigh renaming a state property and so
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
context um where I'll share with you the
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
the final few points I
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
have um it should be noted that there
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
are several Town Forest that Miss
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
Kellogg was involved in helping to
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
conserve and those would be a suitable
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
um opportunity to honor her
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
contributions in the town Force but I do
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
understand the sponsors and her support
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
is is why they would like it to be a
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
state Force that's already in town I I I
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
get that
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
connection um so dncr um we're sincerely
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
we're also sincerely grateful for the
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
success of the Moose plate program um
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
our agency has received um considerable
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
funding over the years and and we're
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
grateful for that for that opportunity
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
that vehicle that
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
exists um but just to conclude my
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
remarks um renaming a state forest um
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
in Miss Kellogg's name is inconsistent
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
with our Memorial policy it triggers a
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
host of administrative changes in our
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
land management system and it does set a
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
precedent for other towns in the future
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
to uh request to rename a state forest
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh on behalf of a more local Regional
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
person um in in a specific case so for
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
these reasons we're we're opposed to
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
renaming of the State Forest I'd be
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions okay thank
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Hackley questions
 
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
of Mr Hackley from members of the commit
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative Abbott
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
please yes could I just wondered if I
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
understand the first and third um
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
objection to naming the force but I just
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could make the committee
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
aware of what um what it says it
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
triggers a host of administrative
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
changes in Our Land Management System
 
01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
right right thank you for the question
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
so we've been managing this this
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
property for decades for a number of
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
years all of our maps all of our files
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
all of our forest management plans um
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
are embedded in the name of Blair State
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
Forest so I actually can't tell you in
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
detail but I have heard from my Land
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
Management staff that it would it would
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
create two identities of the same
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
property so I don't know if we'd have to
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
rename all of our files or we'd just
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
have to say AKA Blair State Forest but
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
my my forestry staff and Land Management
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
problematic okay thank you question for
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
yes okay please go ahead represent FL
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you do you have any examples
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
of forest naming or
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
renaming that were initiated by your
 
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
department and or or at least approved
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
by the department thank you for your
 
01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:14.750 align:start position:0%
by the department thank you for your
question

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
um not my short 10 excuse me my short
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
tenure at the agency I've been there a
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
little over three years but um to my
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge known I have a a very
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
experienced staff that some have some of
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
them have been there for 25 plus years
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
and they they couldn't give me any
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
anecdotal or any comparison of when
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
we've had to rename a State
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
Reservation okay further questions
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
please yes thank you how is the deed
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
showing of ownership on that good thank
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
you for re asking that question I wanted
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify that and I think our our camp
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
supporters know that proper pretty well
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
probably better than I do I've been
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
there once in the winter time but um so
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
there is no deed restriction regarding
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
the name of the property it it could be
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
changed if if this committee so approved
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that's legit that's the first thing
 
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
we checked when we got the request so
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's no we do have properties
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
that are required to stay named after
 
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
the Don after the donor okay um and
 
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
there is as was already confirmed there
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
is no conservation easement on the
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
property uh the state owns it in full
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
all the all the rights to that property
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%

earlier so now I'm going to open the
 
01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill um
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
1547 requiring mileage based exit
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
numbers on tier one highways and I want
 
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
to welcome the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horgan and first
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
of all I want to extend I think on
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
behalf of the entire committee the
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
committee's condolences on the passing
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
of your mother and I know what you're
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
going through I know you thank you okay
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and I appreciate you showing
 
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
up under such circumstances anyway so if
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
you could please proceed with your
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
testimony represent thank you so this is
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
um B 5047 it brings it new New Hampshire
 
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
line with virtually every other state by
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
numbering uh numbering interstate and
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
other Interstate standard highways by uh
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
by mileage rather than sequentially and
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
um that's been mandated by the federal
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
manual and uniform traffic control
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
devices since 2009 and they've been
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
commonplace Nationwide with since the
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
1980s um and the only other state which
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
still incluses uses them is uh is
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont and uh
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's probably an issue probably a lot of
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
people here in the legislature probably
 
01:23:59.709 --> 01:23:59.719 align:start position:0%
thought about I didn't really uh know
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
which exit I live been living off of all
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
these years until I uh started getting
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
interested in the issue I live off of
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
exit 6 off the Spalding Turnpike and
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
that's one of the highways that would be
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
affected by it um actually the exit
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
numbers on the spaling are like kind of
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
weird so doing by mileage would save a
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion because for example
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
exit 5 recently disappeared when they
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
rebuilt the small thing as they said so
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
two of our neighboring states recently
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
made the change over um and I think with
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
no dire consequences um so the problems
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
that were predicted uh by some people
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
such as our governor didn't um didn't
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
happen people got used to it really
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
quickly so I I I happen to do a lot of
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
driving in Massachusetts I probably
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't admit that but I friend family
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
and friends down there and they the
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
change over was painless it's actually
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
now easier to get around and um and in
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
any case the old exit numbers are still
 
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
shown on they have bright yellow
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
placards attached to the standard green
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
exit signs so like all the old numbers
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
are still there in case whatever reason
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
your GPS hasn't been updated or you're
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
still using a paper map or whatever so
 
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
this has been kicking around for for
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
several years um it was been incl
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
there's a project 4
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
4915 which has been included in the
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
first three initial drafts the 10-year
 
01:25:19.109 --> 01:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
Highway plan and then it's always been
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
taken out by uh by gaset you know which
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
is basically as you know the executive
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
Council plus the commissioner of
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation um the first time was in
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
2019 and uh for reasons I don't go into
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony the governor made a bit of
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
fuss over the exit numbers um so it got
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
taken out um so then it was deleted by
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
the uh first incenter of the legislature
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
which became hb220 and actually became
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
HB 1182 because of a very unusual things
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
that happened in the legislature that
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
year so and then the same thing happened
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
in 2021 when they're putting together HB
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
2022 and in 2023 when they're putting
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
together HB 2024
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
so and I think this is a I mean I think
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is a good thing having uh drone on
 
01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.510 align:start position:0%
this is a good thing having uh drone on
having

01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:13.719 align:start position:0%
driven on on highways on highways in
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
other states including um you know two
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
which made the change over very recently
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
um which make this a good time to think
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
about it um over in 993 we got the exit
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
4A and I think uh people from people
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
from out of state or in state are
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
probably may not it probably harder for
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
them to distinguish between Exit 4 and
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
exit 4 a um whereas we went through um
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
mileage Bas numbering we would have Exit
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
12 at mile poost 12 Exit 13 at Mile
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
poost 13 then exit 15 which is what
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
probably most people from out of state
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
are expecting to find anyway so um then
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
the small ing Turnpike which has always
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
been kind of confusing like there I
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
think exit 10 has never existed even on
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
the highway it's almost 70 years old um
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
and there's lots of EX there's several
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
exits which are on one side of the road
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
and not another so that's I think that
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
would be a highway that would be better
 
01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
with uh with um mileage based exits
 
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
instead of sequential exits um and I
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
actually as I said I never actually real
 
01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
I never really like had memorized I live
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
off of exit 6 until like I started
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
looking into this into this issue and
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
finally an i91 east of uh east of i93
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
which is the portion that's um that's uh
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
built it's a tier one Highway built to
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
Interstate standards um the mile po are
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to be changed somewhat and I guess
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh I think probably the final decision
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't been what to ask for but like
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
right now when you head east on New
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 101 which begins in in Keen so
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
54 hour miles east of Kean you pass
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
through Bedford
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
in The Last Mile poost I think was last
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
time I drove down that I was looking I
 
01:27:59.070 --> 01:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
think it's number 54 and then then you
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
have to like you know merge into merge
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
into 293 and on the 93 and it's it's you
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
know it's not exactly the easiest
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
stretch of road to uh make your way down
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the state it's there's ramps coming
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
in from all different directions and
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
people trying to cut in front of you but
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
so it it may seem like it's 46 miles
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
from um from Bedford to uh I guess it's
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
actually it's almost Auburn but in
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester where you finally get on the
 
01:28:27.109 --> 01:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
IE New Hampshire 101 is mile post 100
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
but you're actually about 60 Mi east of
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
keen so um there's they're going to be
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
redoing those mile posts anyway at some
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
point in the not too distant future and
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
but uh so may this is probably a good
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
time to uh change those exit numbers and
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
actually they're which now um starts
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
with exit one which is to I think Route
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
28 and then goes all the way to exit 13
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
in Hampton although oddly the two most
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
not that all the intersections aren't
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
important but the two most important
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
intersections to I95 and the route one
 
01:29:02.669 --> 01:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
ironically are don't have numbers which
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
um probably doesn't make it easier for
 
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
out ofate motorists to uh find those two
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
exits although they're Prett although
 
01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
the signage you know otherwise it
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
complies with the federal banal and it's
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
pretty clear but it just makes things a
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
little bit easier for our drivers and um
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't send it through with the
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um it would probably cost
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
some money but not much and so project
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
40915 has been in those last three draft
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
10year Highway plans the most recent
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
version was 1.3 million we would um
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
which I think is a I think it's money
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
well spent to make life easier for uh
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
well especially alate drivers but even
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
even instate drivers will probably find
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
it easier to it's easier to know it's
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
easier to check the exit number from the
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
mile post than try to remember what the
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
Last Exit you pass especially since we
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
have lettered exits and missing exits
 
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:51.639 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of weird things in our
 
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
Highway ways so um there's like actually
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
two ways to get to the goal of my bill
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
one is to pass this bill which was sort
 
01:29:59.639 --> 01:30:00.669 align:start position:0%
one is to pass this bill which was sort
of

01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh which sort of ask the dot to do it in
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
some some future year I think we gave
 
01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
him I think about 10 years to do which
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
is more than they need or of course you
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
could also try amending the 10-year
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
Highway plan but that's kind of a
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
politically sensitive subject you know
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's uh usually usually usually we
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
hear in the house we like to pass what
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
came over from gasset and sent it over
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate without too many changes but
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
that that is an option you have to do
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing so that's uh that's
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
basically my bill and I'd be happy to
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
take any questions okay thank you
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%

01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Bill oldenberg I'm

the director of project development at
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dot and with me is Lee
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
bonis he's the state highway engineer at
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
the dot um as as representative Horan uh
 
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
stated there's a long history of this
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
project um in uh New Hampshire
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
do um it was created so a little bit of
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
how how Federal Highway is structured so
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
there's the US Department of
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation which oversees highways
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
Bridges Aviation Transit rail um and a
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
subsection of us do is Federal Highway
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
Administration that oversees highways
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
Bridges and basically everything the New
 
01:32:15.149 --> 01:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dot does um they set standards
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
and rules um standards on Highway design
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
standard on bridge design and one of the
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
standards they set is the manual of
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
uniform traffic control devices it sets
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
standards Nationwide standards for
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
pavement markings signing uh
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
construction signing and and and the
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
like so one of the requirements that
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
they stated uh in 2009 was that all exit
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
numbers um in the nation should be based
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
upon mileage based system uh New
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses a a sequential numbering
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
system as you know most to 1 2 3 3 4
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
five it's not mileage based
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
um and not only do they state that it
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
should be mileage based they actually
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
prohibit the use of sequentially
 
01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
numbering system um that was in 2009 uh
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
some years after that we had entered a
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
project in the state 10-year plan uh to
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
renumber the signs and that has been in
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan for the last several
 
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
Cycles um it originally um was removed
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
based upon um from the historical urban
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
legend that I hear is uh a lot of
 
01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
business businesses were um upset and
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
and worried um that they would have to
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
change directions on their uh Maps
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
brochures Etc a lot of them use the exit
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
numbering for um how to get to their
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
their places of business um and it you
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
know sort of the poster child for this
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
is Exit 32 in Lincoln um they have
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
bumper stickers and t-shirts and and
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
magnets and everything is based upon
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
Exit 32 and they sort of branded that as
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
come to Exit 32 and you can do
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
everything um so they don't really want
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
to change and that was one of the
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
reasons why the bill um or the the
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
project in the 10-year plan was removed
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
originally um I think every cycle since
 
01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
then for the last at least four uh
 
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
project has been entered in the 10 year
 
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
plan and it has been removed as as
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative hergan Say by through the
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
gaset process um that happened uh this
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
this this cycle as well we did have a
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
project in the 10year plan and it was
 
01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
removed by gaset
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
um you know so we really don't take a
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
position on it we've tried to do it um
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
it it does offer some um and nuances and
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
and and changes that that are
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
ramifications from it uh sort of as as
 
01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.990 align:start position:0%
ramifications from it uh sort of as as
representative

01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
Oregan stated it it it
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
will still make some of the um some of
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
the directions if you come up the F ever
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
at Turnpike and then becomes I 293 and
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
then it ties into
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
i93 just as today those numbers go from
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
1 to 13 then 4 to 7 and then you pick up
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
11 on i93 that that won't change
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
there'll just be different numbers um so
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh it it does have um its uses and um
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
you know it it it does help um with you
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
know knowing the distance to exits it's
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
also helps an emergency response you'll
 
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
notice that along the interstate there
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
are what we call reference location
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
signs that are mileage based every 10
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
2/10 of a mile along the interstate
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
there's a sign that says what mile
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
marker it is um that the idea would be
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
is the exit sign would match that so you
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
knew um if you were in an accident and
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
you could see that you were at mile
 
01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.430 align:start position:0%
you could see that you were at mile
marker

01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
marker
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
38.2 you know the the next exit of the
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
closest exit for emergency response
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
would uh would be easily denoted it
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be four it would be 38 or 39 or
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
something like that that to match that
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
reference number
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know we were available to to
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on the nuances of
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
it um we would note and I think um
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
representative Horan mentioned there's a
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
few uh logistical uh issues with the
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
bill um in that uh the citation in the
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
mutcd as noted in the bill it as luck
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
would have it uh Federal Highway changed
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
or updated or revised the mutcd last
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
month so the citation uh should be
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
updated and there's also the the funding
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
issue uh is the intent to add this
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
project into the 10-year plan back into
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan or is it to fund it
 
01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
separately because there's no funding we
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
did do a fiscal note that wasn't
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
included um and we you know we're
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
available to talk about that as well hey
 
01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Olden representative void
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Jack please
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr oldenberg
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
thankk you for your testimony I
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
um has there been any impacts either
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
current or future to New Hampshire's
 
01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
ability to receive Federal Highway
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
monies that have been impacted by the
 
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
fact that we've been using sequential
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
mileage versus sequential exits versus
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
mileage B based exit um there's there's
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
a threat um they they can withhold money
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh to date they haven't because we've
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
made a goodfaith effort to include the
 
01:37:53.589 --> 01:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you represent I'm I'm sorry go
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
ahead please one follow Mr chairman
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
thank you sure the the follow-up
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
question I would ask is in in
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
your if if I'm putting you on the spot I
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
sincerely I sincerely apologize but do
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
you see any potential impacts to people
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
with personal GPS systems in their
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles being impacted by going from
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
sequential systems to mileage based
 
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
system I I don't because the the the
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
folks who make the garments and the um
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
and all those um and Google Maps uh they
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
they actually receive our plans um and
 
01:38:34.109 --> 01:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
they know exactly what we're doing so
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
that they can update their uh all the
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
GPS for directions and and and things
 
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
like that so I don't see that as an
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
issue okay thank you very much thank you
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative Jack please uh thank you
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you gentlemen for
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
for appearing uh there's a reference in
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
the bill to tier one highways is that
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
defined in statute anywhere my
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
impression was it's an internal do
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
categorization of Roads it is a tier one
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
road is an interstate basically so or or
 
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
equivalent so so one1 is yes but the
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
question is is tier one defined in
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
statute because it's referenced in the
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
bill I do not uh I do not believe
 
01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you represent Jack
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
represent Bogart please and followed by
 
01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.189 align:start position:0%
represent Bogart please and followed by
represent

01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
Farner if this was not included in the
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and was done as a direct
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
directive to take this on what would be
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
project we estimate 1.4 million and
 
01:39:35.709 --> 01:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
that's just about what the the the
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
10year plan project had in
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
it okay okay yes please continue
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
representar and if this was done outside
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year plan what would be the uh
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
estimated completion date or start date
 
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
of such a project um so the idea would
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
be is we'd have to do every each
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
Interstate at the same time so you
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to have the interstate
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
number hodge podge so the thought would
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
be is we would do uh each
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
Interstate um as a project or or or
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
bundle them together so i93 would
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
probably be we could do all at once 89
 
01:40:19.229 --> 01:40:19.239 align:start position:0%
all at once um when you get to the F
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
ever Turnpike and the 101 Connection in
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh probably do all that at once and then
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast uh I95 uh Spalding
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
Turnpike um probably all at once as well
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
but we would we could e we could do them
 
01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
all at the same time uh probably
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do that um just from a
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
Contracting standpoint it would probably
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
be broken into several projects but um I
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if time frame to do some of
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
them I
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
would sorry Lee bonus uh State traffic
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
engineer um as far as the duration uh so
 
01:40:56.159 --> 01:40:57.390 align:start position:0%
engineer um as far as the duration uh so
from

01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
from the green light to proceed um I
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
think a reasonable time frame would be
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
approximately two years for uh
 
01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
engineering efforts and then a a
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
construction season for the
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
implementation uh and the reason I say
 
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
two years for engineering is uh having
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
to secure a consultant to um perform the
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
work and then
 
01:41:25.149 --> 01:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
um to uh to get it done so to me it
 
01:41:26.589 --> 01:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
looks like a three-year
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
Horizon um from the from the time that
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
we've secured funding and can
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
proceed okay thank you Mr BR you please
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
continue ref B uh So based on what
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying in the bill it says it's
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
given you 10 years to
 
01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
completion from start to complete well
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
from being a uh past to completion of
 
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
2035 would that be sufficient time to
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
complete such a project as this oh yeah
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
I don't think that would be an issue
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the the 10 years allows us
 
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
some flexibility to to ensure that
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
priority projects don't get displaced by
 
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
um by other projects like like this one
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
it may fall into a u a priority within
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
the department and so that does give us
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility okay representative Farner
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
just to be clear U there is no federal
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
funding program for these sign changings
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's separate from the general
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
allocation to the state so that if we
 
01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
were to do this it would come out
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
of funds would otherwise be available
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
for other Highway projects is that
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
correct so we we uh initially as as part
 
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year plan project that project
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
was federally funded so we we were using
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
um uh to to do that project if it isn't
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
part of the 10-year plan it would have
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
to be funded some other way you know
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
General funds or um through betterment
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
funds uh that we don't have but
 
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you uh F okay
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
barones the do has to hire a consultant
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
to replace sign
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
on our highway system did I did I hear
 
01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
on our highway system did I did I hear
that

01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
correctly uh that that would be one
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
approach uh we can do it internally but
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
we have a backlog and and uh limited
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
Staffing uh so adding projects in we
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
like if if we have the opportunity we
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
like to ensure that we have a timeline
 
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to to utilize a
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
consultant the work is not necessarily
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
as as simple as it might might initially
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
appear um adding adding signs and panels
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
um to overhead structures can affect the
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
size of those structures uh which could
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
affect the
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
structural um limits of some of the uh
 
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
the sign Bridges um the the fiscal note
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
that I prepared made some basic
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
assumptions uh but didn't get into the
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
details of specific locations in some
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
cases sign panel may be too small to
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
accommodate a three-digit number for
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
instance so then we have to not just
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
throw it an overlay panel up but we
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
would have to replace the structural
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
portion of that sign to to ensure that
 
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
that number is there uh so there's quite
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
a bit of
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
um work that goes into ensuring once a
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
contractor is let loose uh on a project
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
encoun um situ situations that aren't
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able they're not going to be
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
able to to construct so we do have to
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
have an engineering review of of each
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
and every location um some cases there's
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
multiple signs we have to make sure that
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
we've found all of the signs that make
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
reference to a specific exit number uh
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
and so that it does take effort
 
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
um the idea is that once we go to
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
construction that it is very
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
straightforward and they can accomplish
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
the work very quickly so that the number
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
changes take place over a short period
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
of time and the idea is to minimize
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
confusion for emergency responders um
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
where yesterday that was exit four and
 
01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
now it's exit 16 uh and so uh we're
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with this with with the mile
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
marker project that uh that we we
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
discussed on Route 101 where there's a a
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
change in mile marker numbers so that
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
implementation has to be monitored and
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
and um we want to minimize the duration
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
of that work so
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
engineering up front helps minimize
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
surprises during the construction so if
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
I clarify a little bit we'll step back
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll get really deep into the weeds
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
so our our plan is like every other
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
state that's had to do this in the
 
01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
Northeast we're not just going to change
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
the exit number we're going to add a
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
another sign panel underneath that says
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
either previous exit five and now we we
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
renumber the exit or we leave the exit
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
the same and some states have said mile
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
post exit you know 38 so I 95 up in
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
Maine y exactly so that and historically
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
their their plan is to leave them up you
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
know until everybody gets used to them
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
10 years 20 years or whenever we next
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
change the signs over and then take
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
those signs down and and leave the exit
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
numbers the way they are but it's not
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
just to change the exit number but what
 
01:46:52.589 --> 01:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
that requires is addition signing adding
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
adding a panel or adding a square
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
footage of sign to every structure and
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
that means we have to check wind loads
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
and overhead sign structures and it's a
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
lot it's a lot more complicated than you
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
would think it's not just changing a
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
number so so just pleas to amplify
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
director bonus's testimony and what you
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
just said Mr oldenberg
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
when when do goes out let's just let's
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
just take exit three down and sale
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
because the governor likes Exit 3 okay
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
and it was alluded to by representative
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
Oregan in his testimony the sign that
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
for me to get off on exit 3 going
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
Southbound the stanions that go in in
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
that sign has been engineered to support
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
that particular sign so what you're
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
saying is is that in order to change
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
that existing sign from exit 3 to let's
 
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
just say exit 6 because I don't have my
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
garment with me it's going to say exit
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
six and there'll be a second sign just
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
to do that requires a level of
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
engineering to ensure that the two poles
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
that are out there are going to be
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of enough to hold not just
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
the original sign but the additional
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
sign that's going to go on to meet that
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
it could um I mean it it
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
would depends on the number it depends
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
on is it a full sign structure across
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
and are there multiple signs being added
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
there is a factor safety and that goes
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
into the design um you know initially
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
but we we would would require a check I
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate you cander thank you okay
 
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
thank you referent boy Miss yes go ahead
 
01:48:28.109 --> 01:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
please referent jurus briefly is it is
 
01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
it f suggest you want to try to avoid
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
what happened with the sign structure on
 
01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
the exit 5 interchange in
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
nashille yes thank you okay thank you uh
 
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
further question yes Ram Newman
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
please yes thank you just for maybe for
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
only my clarification this is not an
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
optional thing you have to have this
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
done and completed by
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
2035 um well according to the
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
mutcd we were supposed to have had it
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
done by now um but in the in the bill
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's a the completion date is 2035 or
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
2034 and we could we could meet that
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's 10 years okay follow please
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
continue repr is there
 
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
any stated that you know right now if
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
you just say you're not going to do it
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do it nobody wants you
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
to do it is there any
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
penalty there potentially could be so
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway could um could withhold
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
money um because we we're not
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
compliant uh so I sort of like you know
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have a primary SE seat Bel law
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
so um we we they withhold I don't know
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
what it is $5 million a year or
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
something like that uh because we don't
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a seat belt law so they could do
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
the same thing with this um eventually
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
it is it is one section of a thousand
 
01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:56.830 align:start position:0%
it is it is one section of a thousand
page

01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
document um I'm I think we're at greater
 
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
risk when we become the last
 
01:50:08.109 --> 01:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
state um and the the the pool of states
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
that haven't done this is shrinking
 
01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.709 align:start position:0%
that haven't done this is shrinking
dramatically

01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
um why this basically started was um in
 
01:50:20.669 --> 01:50:20.679 align:start position:0%
the Northeast everybody used sequential
 
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country used mile post
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
markers Federal Highway wanted a
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
standard they basically said majority
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
rules it's mileage based okay and so
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
everybody in the Northeast has basically
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
made the move except for a few holdouts
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
um including us to to get
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
changed okay yes please continue further
 
01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:46.639 align:start position:0%
follow up so the lack of a seat Bel
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
requirement the penalty the money
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
withheld for that
 
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't you could pay for this with I
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
mean if they're withholding 5 million
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
and this is going to cost 1.3 I mean
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
could that be could somebody say that oh
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
did okay and and oh really this is the
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
last one so Vermont is
 
01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
still Vermont has switch has switched
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
over so some of their signs I I think
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
most of their signs on Interstate 89
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
have a new mile or a previous mile um I
 
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
you know we had Delaware the New Jersey
 
01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
Turnpike so the turnpikes are they're
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
not federally oversight so um they're
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
less of risk um and what was the other
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
state new New York New York and I I I I
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
believe it's the New York throughway
 
01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
which is all the way across the state
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's one of their reasons very
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
expensive thank you okay thank you
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
represent Newman further question yes
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
represent Bart please thank you for your
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
patience um more of a
 
01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
clarification in the bill it says it
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
should be completed by
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
2035 uh you had indicated
 
01:52:11.069 --> 01:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
that in order to get Federal money to
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
take care of this usually it's on the
 
01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.109 align:start position:0%
take care of this usually it's on the
10-year

01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
plan and if it's not in the 10year plan
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
then we have to use State money more
 
01:52:24.109 --> 01:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
than likely State money to accomplish
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
this and it's been my
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
experience uh or as indicated earlier
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
also if it's on the 10year plan it keeps
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
losing its foot place or get lower on
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
the list so theoretically if it's in the
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
10-year plan it may never get
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
accomplished because the federal money
 
01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
is going to consistently be used on
 
01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
higher level
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
priorities would that be correct and so
 
01:53:00.589 --> 01:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
then we're back facing a a 2035 deadline
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
using State funds
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
anyway well I if it was in the 10-year
 
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
plan our plan all along because Federal
 
01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
Highway allowed us was to use um highway
 
01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:15.639 align:start position:0%
safety uh Improvement plan money it's a
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
subgroup of the bucket of money we get
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
and um that could do that much sooner
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
than 10 years um those those projects
 
01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
don't go out as far um so we could
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
probably you know fund that within the
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
next uh couple years um and start um
 
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
doing the projects so it wouldn't have
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
to wait 10 years to be done okay yes
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
please continue representative could
 
01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
this board as an amendment to this uh
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
set the priority on this to like like
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
versus we we generally don't you know
 
01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
well we don't set a priority if you
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
change the date to require it to be done
 
01:54:08.350 --> 01:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
by you know before 2030 you know like
 
01:54:10.589 --> 01:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
2030 or something like that that would
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
be setting the priority more or less um
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
changing the completion
 
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
date thank thank you okay thank you
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
represent bogar further questions of the
 
01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
committee from the gentleman from do I I
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
do have one question too you said
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
there'll be a transition if this is
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
implemented drivers will still be able
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
to underneath the new system which is M
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh mileage based right I mean I'm sorry
 
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
I'm get a little confused here they'll
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
be able to see what the old system is so
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
they won't get too confused in getting
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
used to this new system correct there
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
would there would be both the previous
 
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
exit number and the new exit number the
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
new exit number if this is done and you
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
said it would you put have these signs
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
up for a transition for how you don't
 
01:54:56.069 --> 01:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
now have any idea whether five years 10
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
years typically when we when we make
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
changes like this um we would install
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
the signs and then at the next for the
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
life of the sign uh which generally
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're about 20 years uh but if the
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
signs knocked down we wouldn't put it
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
back up after okay so we would we would
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
allow for a certain period of time and
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
then as they essentially die naturally
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh they would would do okay but you're
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
saying about maximum of a 20 year the
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
sign so sort of a transition but if it
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
the sign was knocked down it would be be
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
sooner it would just go to the the
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
system the way it is but it would you'd
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
give drivers hopefully a few years
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
transition at least so they wouldn't get
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
too confused I I think the the point
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
would be is we wouldn't go out and spend
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
more money to take the signs down okay
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
we would we would do it as part of the
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
natural replacement natural or okay all
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
right thank you gentlemen further
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative Abbott please
 
01:55:52.589 --> 01:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
yes just to follow up on that the figure
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
that you gave of
 
01:55:58.350 --> 01:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
$1.4 million would that include having
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
these the old sign as well as the new
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
sign when I prepared the uh the fiscal
 
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
note that was an assumption that it was
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
not included um the additional cost it
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
was the had I had to come up with a
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
basis for the cost and I took the
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
absolute minimum which would be
 
01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
basically an overlay panel over the
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
existing numbers with the new numbers um
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
if we were to put temporary uh or um uh
 
01:56:34.589 --> 01:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
formally formally known as signs up
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
we'll just call them that um those are
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
usually placed um smaller less prominent
 
01:56:43.149 --> 01:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh in a location that wouldn't uh we
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily have a structural
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
issue we would probably place it on a
 
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
post if it were an overhead similar to
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
what Massachusetts to done um the
 
01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
additional cost for that is is is not
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
significant um you know maybe another
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
$200,000 $300,000 for if we were to add
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
this additional um you know formally
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
known as signs
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you uh gentleman
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative a fur any further
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
questions of these two gentlemen the do
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
from the committee any further questions
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
coming in answering our questions
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you okay is there
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wishes to testify for
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
or against House Bill 1547 in the room I
 
01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody so I will now adjourn
 
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
this uh public hearing on House Bill
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
1547 we are done for the morning and our
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
next hearing will be at 1:15 when we
 
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
take up House Bill
 
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
1,43 relative to the capital
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the legislative
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
parking garage design that's S one of
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
the the chairs bills so he should be
 
01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
here and we will uh hear public to and I
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
believe something about he there's an
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to but I got check with him on
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
that and we will hear from him on that
 
01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
bill and we've got two other bills uh
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
1:45 and 3M and hopefully we'll be done
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
by by 3:30 4 o'clock at the latest Just

03:20:31.550 --> 03:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
you used to serve I Serv a long it's a
 
03:20:34.110 --> 03:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
long time ago now Mr chairman you got a
 
03:20:36.349 --> 03:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
lot of good experience this committee
 
03:20:38.990 --> 03:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
help it certainly does thank you thank
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
you very so for the record my name is
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
Terry PF I'm the chief Operating Officer
 
03:20:43.950 --> 03:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
for the general court of New Hampshire
 
03:20:46.510 --> 03:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
and is by way of a little history and uh
 
03:20:48.910 --> 03:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support 1043 and was request
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the um General Court to repurpose
 
03:20:57.030 --> 03:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
These funds in uh the session of 2017
 
03:20:59.229 --> 03:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
for the capital budget of 201819 I
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
believe it was as when when this
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation became uh in the capital
 
03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
budget it was for design because the gcn
 
03:21:08.670 --> 03:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
itself our Branch was going to lead the
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
design at that time we actually went
 
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
through the process of our PS and got um
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
different design companies in place but
 
03:21:18.750 --> 03:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
then uh By the time all that transpired
 
03:21:20.590 --> 03:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
Co hit and so that got put on the back
 
03:21:22.950 --> 03:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
burner and then the new process for the
 
03:21:25.710 --> 03:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
parking garage took a a different route
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
so we went through the Public Works
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
division of U Das and Das took lead on
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
it the funding got uh got appropriated
 
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
in several different pieces of
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that you folks uh some of
 
03:21:39.429 --> 03:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
you folks passed in the previous
 
03:21:42.030 --> 03:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
sessions and so this money became
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
available for other purposes so now the
 
03:21:45.750 --> 03:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
general court part of my job I got
 
03:21:48.630 --> 03:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
appointed from house chief of staff to
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
um the Chief Operating Officer and
 
03:21:51.710 --> 03:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
within the scope of that work is long
 
03:21:54.429 --> 03:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
range planning plant and property uh
 
03:21:55.710 --> 03:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
with a whole array of other
 
03:21:57.269 --> 03:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the divisions and
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
all the joint staff so we um uh as part
 
03:22:02.750 --> 03:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that longrange planning we looked at
 
03:22:04.349 --> 03:22:04.359 align:start position:0%
the needs of the complex and the needs
 
03:22:06.389 --> 03:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
of the complex are many and Vary some of
 
03:22:07.630 --> 03:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
them are the seats you're sitting in now
 
03:22:10.189 --> 03:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
are 50 years old so we're looking at uh
 
03:22:12.990 --> 03:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
a complete renovation of this building
 
03:22:14.429 --> 03:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
as we've done on some of you might have
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
noticed on the first floor of the state
 
03:22:18.229 --> 03:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
house as well so these dollars would go
 
03:22:20.830 --> 03:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
towards that and it would be um for the
 
03:22:22.910 --> 03:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
renovation of the complex when needed
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
emergency funds for the complex when
 
03:22:26.830 --> 03:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
needed such as if they're needed for
 
03:22:28.189 --> 03:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
something that just occurred over the
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
weekend for instance so there's there's
 
03:22:32.110 --> 03:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
many things that we need to have
 
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
available to keep this operation
 
03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
operational so the osks can represent
 
03:22:38.469 --> 03:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
the people that you are sent here to do
 
03:22:41.910 --> 03:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
so so with this uh these dollars the the
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
appro even for the chairs if you look at
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
the chairs that you're sitting in at the
 
03:22:48.150 --> 03:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
time I think they were $256 a piece back
 
03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:49.229 align:start position:0%
time I think they were $256 a piece back
in

03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:22:52.429 --> 03:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
1975 and if you ameiz that we've got a
 
03:22:53.830 --> 03:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
heck of a good deal on those seats and
 
03:22:55.550 --> 03:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
they've been well but they're marginal
 
03:22:58.229 --> 03:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
now they need repairs regularly the
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
tables if you look underneath our tables
 
03:23:01.469 --> 03:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
here they're held together and secured
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
by pieces of plywood because we flip
 
03:23:05.950 --> 03:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
those over and do that they're they're a
 
03:23:08.429 --> 03:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
bear to try to move when we reconfigure
 
03:23:10.510 --> 03:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
the rooms and they serve their purpose
 
03:23:13.469 --> 03:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
as well as as did the chairs but at 50
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
years old that's a lifespan as you know
 
03:23:17.469 --> 03:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
we build things in public works to last
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
50 to 70 years we're at the end of life
 
03:23:22.349 --> 03:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
of some of the stuff so that's uh some
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the money will be repurposed for that
 
03:23:26.590 --> 03:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
as well so it and that's the request as
 
03:23:28.750 --> 03:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
far as the amendment I believe that no
 
03:23:30.590 --> 03:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
one from gcn has any problem from that
 
03:23:34.070 --> 03:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the administrator side um uh as far
 
03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
as that goes I had a discussion with the
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
speaker the president and the chairman
 
03:23:38.950 --> 03:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee so with that I'll
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
gladly uh field any questions it's nice
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
nice to be back in front of Public Works
 
03:23:44.950 --> 03:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
by the way because as as the chairman
 
03:23:46.830 --> 03:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned I had a pleasurable time
 
03:23:48.429 --> 03:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
serving here but it was number of years
 
03:23:50.189 --> 03:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
ago was in the 90s
 
03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you go yes representor Mills
 
03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr path I just want to
 
03:23:59.070 --> 03:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh reiterate double check with you to to
 
03:24:00.910 --> 03:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
establish the fact that this money has
 
03:24:02.830 --> 03:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
already been appropriated we are not
 
03:24:04.750 --> 03:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
asking for new funds this is money
 
03:24:06.710 --> 03:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's been appropriated been in the
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
budgets and it served its purpose and
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
now we're just re appropriating Sur
 
03:24:13.510 --> 03:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
plusus funds correct it's not it's not
 
03:24:16.150 --> 03:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
surplus funds it's a it's funds that are
 
03:24:18.590 --> 03:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
non-aps for the general core and so we
 
03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
they're placed in there it's not bonding
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
money it's it's money that's already
 
03:24:23.870 --> 03:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
there in our capital budget we just need
 
03:24:25.550 --> 03:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
to repurpose it so that we can utilize
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
it for the full complex needs we're
 
03:24:29.550 --> 03:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
we're bolstering all kinds of things
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
here we're bolstering your security
 
03:24:33.189 --> 03:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
levels we're bolstering all uh a number
 
03:24:34.750 --> 03:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
of needs will be met by these dollars
 
03:24:37.469 --> 03:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
being available for the complex he thank
 
03:24:39.229 --> 03:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
you further questions ask representative

for
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
the design of the parking garage is gone
 
03:24:50.070 --> 03:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
no that means the money for the parking
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
garage was uh was obtained in a
 
03:24:53.590 --> 03:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
different piece of legislation and is
 
03:24:56.830 --> 03:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
already in in process the design and
 
03:24:58.910 --> 03:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
development of that parking garage is
 
03:25:00.349 --> 03:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
complete now it's going to planning
 
03:25:02.630 --> 03:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
board in front of conquer just as a
 
03:25:04.990 --> 03:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
matter of Statute and the garage that
 
03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
building will be coming down shortly by
 
03:25:10.030 --> 03:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
April I have some questions on that if
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
the parking garage is a different issue
 
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
gladly meet with you and discuss that
 
03:25:14.670 --> 03:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
design of the parking y I'll gladly meet
 
03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
with you we have a commission that just
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
barely met uh yesterday uh that's
 
03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
overseeing the parking garage uh
 
03:25:22.269 --> 03:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
statutory commission as well so I'll
 
03:25:24.030 --> 03:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
gladly meet with you I designed to build
 
03:25:26.030 --> 03:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
100 Commercial IND okay I don't doubt it
 
03:25:27.870 --> 03:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
repres you you so yeah appreciate you
 
03:25:29.189 --> 03:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
have doing the follow but if you have
 
03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
any other questions today that no I just
 
03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
want when I saw it scratched out here I
 
03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
just thought it was Dead Issue nope live
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
issue it's going to be constructed soon
 
03:25:41.830 --> 03:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully oh representative Jack please
 
03:25:44.229 --> 03:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh would you
 
03:25:46.030 --> 03:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
agree with me that the funds
 
03:25:49.150 --> 03:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
appropriated here were laps extended
 
03:25:52.030 --> 03:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
every time since they were appropriated
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
so they are still available in that
 
03:25:55.830 --> 03:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
account that's
 
03:25:55.840 --> 03:25:57.349 align:start position:0%
account that's
correct

03:25:57.349 --> 03:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:26:01.349 --> 03:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes bogar please just for
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
clarification this money being moved to
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
something different would have no
 
03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on a new legislative
 
03:26:13.630 --> 03:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
parking garage being built has it will
 
03:26:15.070 --> 03:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
have absolutely nothing to do with the
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
parking garage as soon as that title's
 
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
changed it doesn't have anything to do
 
03:26:21.030 --> 03:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
currently because it's already been uh
 
03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
developed with other dollars that were
 
03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
put together in legislation this is
 
03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
money that we have in our general court
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
capital budget that we need to change
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
the title so that we can utilize it on
 
03:26:32.750 --> 03:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
the other needs of the general
 
03:26:35.469 --> 03:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
court thank you forther questions yes
 
03:26:38.349 --> 03:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
represent fa me please uh not so much a
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
question but pointing out that this
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
amendment deletes the effective date um
 
03:26:47.269 --> 03:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
clause and does not replace it so I
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
think that we ought to fix this before
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.950 --> 03:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
it yes Jack please yeah if you read the
 
03:27:00.269 --> 03:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh it say it says amend the bill by
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
deleting section two and renumbering
 
03:27:06.030 --> 03:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
section two to read as section two and
 
03:27:08.830 --> 03:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
three so section two becomes section
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
three section two becomes
 
03:27:14.429 --> 03:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
the new text that's here so it does not
 
03:27:17.070 --> 03:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
delete the effective
 
03:27:19.790 --> 03:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
date thank you represent Jack uh further
 
03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:22.840 align:start position:0%

03:28:41.469 --> 03:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh we approach represent to
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
mcon with a uh problem that we had with
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
originally with our boiler replace
 
03:28:48.910 --> 03:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
replacement project that as you see in
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment was originally uh
 
03:28:53.670 --> 03:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated in 2019 which was actually
 
03:28:55.550 --> 03:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
before both the director and myself were
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
at police standards and training and
 
03:28:59.229 --> 03:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
those Appropriations have been continued
 
03:29:02.349 --> 03:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
each by Anum as that boiler project has
 
03:29:06.349 --> 03:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
gone on that was managed by uh Das
 
03:29:09.469 --> 03:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
Public Works uh as we reached the end of
 
03:29:11.670 --> 03:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
this boiler project
 
03:29:13.389 --> 03:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
we have discovered that the original
 
03:29:15.950 --> 03:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
scope did not include replacing uh
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
controller units that are used to
 
03:29:21.150 --> 03:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
control pumps now I'm not an engineering
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
expert but uh that control pumps that
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
control the flow of the water throughout
 
03:29:27.309 --> 03:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
the building to the thermostats to
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
control the it properly so effectively
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
we were unable to uh properly control
 
03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
the heat in the building we have to
 
03:29:36.670 --> 03:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
manually each morning run the pumps and
 
03:29:38.110 --> 03:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
turn them off and make sure that they're
 
03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
working and it's very manual so when we
 
03:29:43.150 --> 03:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
approach Public Works to try to get this
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
corrected uh they got an estimate of
 
03:29:49.269 --> 03:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
approximately $122,000 to replace to
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
actually install controllers that will
 
03:29:53.070 --> 03:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
work with those boilers but they told us
 
03:29:55.309 --> 03:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
that it was outside the scope of the
 
03:29:57.950 --> 03:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
original uh appropriation so we had
 
03:30:00.110 --> 03:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
asked uh representative makoni to please
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
allow us to be able to uh work on that
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
controllers there's also a couple other
 
03:30:06.510 --> 03:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
issues that were discovered with the
 
03:30:08.229 --> 03:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
heating system and thermostats in the
 
03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
building that we hope to be able to
 
03:30:13.030 --> 03:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
repair with the remaining approximately
 
03:30:15.070 --> 03:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
$400,000 that is left in this
 
03:30:17.229 --> 03:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation for that
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
project along with this uh we struggle
 
03:30:22.269 --> 03:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
at police standards of training with a
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
building that is aging and has not had
 
03:30:27.710 --> 03:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
much uh ongoing repairs since its
 
03:30:30.389 --> 03:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
original construction and we do have a
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
problem that bubbled up so to speak this
 
03:30:35.550 --> 03:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
this winter with our tactical Center
 
03:30:39.670 --> 03:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
Floor coming up and uh that has been
 
03:30:41.309 --> 03:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
original to when that cast practical
 
03:30:43.830 --> 03:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
Center was built I believe in 1994
 
03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there and uh we don't have
 
03:30:49.790 --> 03:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh funds in our operating budget which
 
03:30:52.309 --> 03:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
as you know was a zero budget this year
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
to try to repair that and our initial
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
estimate to replace it as is is about
 
03:31:02.349 --> 03:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
$250,000 um so that is another issue we
 
03:31:05.590 --> 03:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
had asked to hopefully be addressed I
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
had approached Das and asked for
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
emergency funding to repair the floor
 
03:31:13.309 --> 03:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
and then when they looked at the the
 
03:31:15.229 --> 03:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
scope of emergency funding they said
 
03:31:17.990 --> 03:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the floor would not fit under that
 
03:31:19.910 --> 03:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
category of uh being able to provide
 
03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
emergency funding to repair it so that's
 
03:31:24.110 --> 03:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
why we asked for that to be included in
 
03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
here the third issue we have that we've
 
03:31:30.269 --> 03:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
added here is we have two projects one
 
03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
of which is very very important to the
 
03:31:33.710 --> 03:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
essential operations of police standards
 
03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
and training that were uh capital
 
03:31:39.389 --> 03:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
projects originally that in 2020 became
 
03:31:42.269 --> 03:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
arpa funed projects
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh and with the several years that have
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
gone by Public Works has finally got an
 
03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
engineer to evaluate the cost of those
 
03:31:51.870 --> 03:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
projects and they far exceed what we
 
03:31:55.070 --> 03:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
have allocated through gopher funds so
 
03:31:57.630 --> 03:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
we have been asking uh the goer office
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
to find additional funding specifically
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
for the most important project is which
 
03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
is our range ventilation uh repair uh
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
the firing range which is essential to
 
03:32:09.710 --> 03:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
the operation of the police academy as
 
03:32:12.349 --> 03:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
you can imagine uh that ventilation
 
03:32:14.830 --> 03:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
system is original and it is not working
 
03:32:17.229 --> 03:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
properly and so we don't want to have
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
that combustion or that atmosphere
 
03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
That's not healthy building up inside
 
03:32:23.710 --> 03:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
the building and so we've been trying to
 
03:32:26.790 --> 03:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
get that uh ventilation system replaced
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so we've also added in here that
 
03:32:30.990 --> 03:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
depending on whether or not we get the
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
go for money uh we're hoping to be as
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
flexible as possible with the little bit
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
of funds we have to fix the Tactical
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
Center floor the boiler and and
 
03:32:43.110 --> 03:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully get that range project done by
 
03:32:46.269 --> 03:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
combining those those arpa funds I hope
 
03:32:48.510 --> 03:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
that makes sense um it's it's a
 
03:32:50.429 --> 03:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
complicated kind of a pro problem we
 
03:32:52.349 --> 03:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
have that we're trying every which way
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
to solve uh to to sustain the use of the
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
building as best we can thank
 
03:33:01.229 --> 03:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair uh and thank you
 
03:33:03.550 --> 03:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
for taking the question uh so this
 
03:33:06.349 --> 03:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
figure uh is all inclusive and it will
 
03:33:08.590 --> 03:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
cover all the items that you have just
 
03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
discussed it will replace the uh the
 
03:33:13.469 --> 03:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
facility improvements for the boilers on
 
03:33:16.550 --> 03:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
for the for speaking to each other the
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh the your range ventilation problems
 
03:33:21.229 --> 03:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
that you're having and the floors this
 
03:33:24.309 --> 03:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
will cover all all those items no it
 
03:33:26.590 --> 03:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
will not oh it will not
 
03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
no this was meant to in case we don't
 
03:33:31.110 --> 03:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
get the go for money we have some
 
03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility to use this $400,000 so
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
you've got the flexibility to use it as
 
03:33:38.189 --> 03:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
necessary in this correct if we were say
 
03:33:47.510 --> 03:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
03:33:50.670 --> 03:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question what is your
 
03:33:52.630 --> 03:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated amount you're hoping to get
 
03:33:52.640 --> 03:33:55.150 align:start position:0%
anticipated amount you're hoping to get
from

03:33:55.150 --> 03:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:58.510 --> 03:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
goer the uh both of the projects that
 
03:34:02.550 --> 03:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
were approved with goer funds uh were uh
 
03:34:05.950 --> 03:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
initially appropriated and once uh the
 
03:34:08.429 --> 03:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
state Engineers came in with the the
 
03:34:11.189 --> 03:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
final assessment uh both of the projects
 
03:34:14.189 --> 03:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
were appropriated at less than 50% of
 
03:34:16.269 --> 03:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
the cost of each one of the projects as
 
03:34:20.229 --> 03:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
initially uh outlined the exact number
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh with uh that reflects the total
 
03:34:26.189 --> 03:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
shortfall of the two arpa projects is uh
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
576,000

03:34:41.189 --> 03:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
576,000
 
03:34:44.189 --> 03:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
for this I'm looking here under Section
 
03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
A of the amendment I'm assuming we're
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
talking about the amendment uh that'll
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
be 1043 Amendment um it says under
 
03:34:58.110 --> 03:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:58.120 --> 03:34:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
35,000

03:34:59.910 --> 03:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
35,000
 
03:35:02.469 --> 03:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
1,35 and then for purchase training
 
03:35:06.429 --> 03:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.439 --> 03:35:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
$150,000

03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:35:11.189 --> 03:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
so you're looking to appropriate
 
03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:18.189 align:start position:0%
so you're looking to appropriate
$1,185

03:35:18.189 --> 03:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
$1,185
 
03:35:21.790 --> 03:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
th000 negative sir so that that funding
 
03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
was spent on the boilers the remaining
 
03:35:26.990 --> 03:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
funds that are in that account come to
 
03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
about $400,000 and that is what we're
 
03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
asking to be able to it's
 
03:35:35.189 --> 03:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
$440,000 and $
 
03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
34.7 440,000 K that's 440 340
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
so followup
 
03:35:47.189 --> 03:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
please so you've got already the 440,000
 
03:35:51.870 --> 03:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
now you're looking to appropriate more
 
03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
money we I think our effort was to just
 
03:35:58.030 --> 03:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh receive the permission of this court
 
03:35:59.950 --> 03:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
to use that
 
03:36:02.750 --> 03:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
$400,000 in a more flexible way and we
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to be transparent to come here to
 
03:36:08.510 --> 03:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
get that permission for that uh the
 
03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of use those funds that
 
03:36:12.510 --> 03:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
have already been appropriated for the
 
03:36:14.910 --> 03:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
boiler project to just have flexibility
 
03:36:18.550 --> 03:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
to work across all these projects if if
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity to get access to
 
03:36:24.269 --> 03:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
more funds we are certainly we certainly
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
stand ready to to work in that direction
 
03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:28.670 align:start position:0%
stand ready to to work in that direction
as

03:36:28.670 --> 03:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:36:32.710 --> 03:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
well follow up please Contin so the
 
03:36:37.189 --> 03:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
440,000 you want to that's left over
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
from replacing your bowler you're going
 
03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
to use that to change the
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
controllers and you're going to put a
 
03:36:44.520 --> 03:36:46.110 align:start position:0%
controllers and you're going to put a
floor

03:36:46.110 --> 03:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
floor
 
03:36:46.120 --> 03:36:47.710 align:start position:0%
floor
in

03:36:47.710 --> 03:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:36:50.269 --> 03:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much
 
03:36:53.710 --> 03:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
it if we had any uh
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
excess uh we would like to be able to
 
03:36:57.870 --> 03:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
just expend that money that's already
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
sitting in our account on these other in
 
03:37:02.309 --> 03:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
support of completion of those other
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
projects as well we have no idea what if
 
03:37:07.710 --> 03:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
any funds we're going to get from the
 
03:37:11.229 --> 03:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
Gopher office to support the two capital
 
03:37:39.389 --> 03:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:41.309 --> 03:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
underapproximation funds have nothing to
 
03:37:45.309 --> 03:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
do with the garage funds for the uh
 
03:37:48.189 --> 03:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
legislative parking garage no nothing
 
03:37:51.630 --> 03:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you I sense some maybe
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
some confusion by representative Bogart
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering I don't know if you
 
03:37:57.309 --> 03:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
gentlemen would mind we have Christopher
 
03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
Shay from the legislative budget
 
03:38:01.389 --> 03:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
assistance he might be able to help
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
clarify if you gentlemen don't mind and
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
at the end Mr Shay if you could fill out
 
03:38:08.910 --> 03:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
a pink card though but I appreciate you
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
good morning for uh good afternoon for
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
the record Chris Shay from the
 
03:38:18.990 --> 03:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
legislative budget Assistance Office uh
 
03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
just to clarify for the committee House
 
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 1043 is not a new appropriation nor
 
03:38:26.590 --> 03:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
is the amendment that's before you as
 
03:38:29.070 --> 03:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
well both of those projects are
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
repurposing prior approved Capital
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from prior Capital
 
03:38:36.510 --> 03:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
budgets so these are situations where
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
there was money left and the agencies or
 
03:38:41.950 --> 03:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
the branch in the case of the bill is
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
introduced want to use those funds for
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
other purposes so it's already been
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated it's already been bonded um
 
03:38:51.150 --> 03:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
now they just want to expand the use and
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
specifically here with the police
 
03:38:55.469 --> 03:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
standards and Council
 
03:38:58.389 --> 03:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
um they have gotten some money through
 
03:39:00.670 --> 03:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
arpa which they've testified to you that
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
it wasn't quite enough to complete the
 
03:39:04.429 --> 03:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
project they have a boiler project that
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
they completed which originally was
 
03:39:08.030 --> 03:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated a milion
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
$35,000 and they have $400,000
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
remaining that they would like to use
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
for several different projects but
 
03:39:16.189 --> 03:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
they're still in the process of working
 
03:39:19.030 --> 03:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office and gopher to
 
03:39:21.229 --> 03:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
um obtain potentially additional arpa
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
funds once they know that they would
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
have a better idea as to where the money
 
03:39:27.469 --> 03:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
would be applied but again it's it's no
 
03:39:30.269 --> 03:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
new appropriation you're not um
 
03:39:32.349 --> 03:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
expanding the bonding Authority this
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
money has already been appropriated
 
03:39:35.469 --> 03:39:35.479 align:start position:0%
through a capital budget and all the
 
03:39:38.189 --> 03:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
bill does is change the purpose by
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
expanding the title so hopefully that
 
03:39:43.590 --> 03:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
helps a little bit um but I figured I'd
 
03:39:45.349 --> 03:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
come over and try to help you with that
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
if it was going to be useful thank you
 
03:39:49.630 --> 03:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Shay questions of Mr Shay from the
 
03:39:51.309 --> 03:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
committee yes go ahead please representa
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
Newton thank you Mr chairman and thanks
 
03:39:56.349 --> 03:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so these projects
 
03:39:58.189 --> 03:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
that are you're trying to get the money
 
03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
to spend on are they approved by gopher
 
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
so the goer money if this goes forward
 
03:40:05.790 --> 03:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
the goer money can be used towards these
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
projects that's already been cleared so
 
03:40:10.389 --> 03:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
there's two projects that the um Council
 
03:40:13.150 --> 03:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
has gotten money from arpa that's been
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
it's gone through gopher gone through
 
03:40:15.790 --> 03:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and they're allowed
 
03:40:19.030 --> 03:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
to use that um as was testified by the
 
03:40:20.670 --> 03:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
director when the projects came back
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
from Public Works the amounts
 
03:40:25.710 --> 03:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
appropriated were less than 50% of the
 
03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
actual cost of the projects so now
 
03:40:30.990 --> 03:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
they're trying to the the uh council is
 
03:40:33.550 --> 03:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
now trying to find um sources of revenue
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
that they can use to complete the
 
03:40:37.630 --> 03:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
projects that they have this is One
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
Source by the amending the capital
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
budget because the
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
$400,000 if you don't approve this today
 
03:40:46.110 --> 03:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
what will happen is at the end of the
 
03:40:49.590 --> 03:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
banum it will lapse and um if you were
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
remember during the capital budget
 
03:40:54.030 --> 03:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
process you go through potential laps
 
03:40:56.189 --> 03:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and see if you can reuse
 
03:40:59.110 --> 03:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
those or repurpose those so this is a
 
03:41:01.870 --> 03:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a in a sense a jump on that
 
03:41:04.269 --> 03:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
you're repurposing These funds to allow
 
03:41:06.189 --> 03:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
for several other projects that weren't
 
03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the original capital project capital
 
03:41:10.590 --> 03:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
budget excuse me
 
03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
does that answer your quest question rep
 
03:41:12.160 --> 03:41:13.309 align:start position:0%
does that answer your quest question rep
of

03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:41:16.990 --> 03:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
Newton further yeah it does answer my
 
03:41:18.670 --> 03:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
question but now I've got a concern why
 
03:41:20.349 --> 03:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
did you wait till today and tell us we
 
03:41:22.670 --> 03:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
have to do it today is that what I just
 
03:41:25.189 --> 03:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
heard you say no I'm not saying you have
 
03:41:26.630 --> 03:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
to do anything today I'm just trying to
 
03:41:27.910 --> 03:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
explain to you that's what I thought I
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
heard I thought I heard you said we have
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
to act on this
 
03:41:33.309 --> 03:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
today but that may there may have been
 
03:41:35.309 --> 03:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
some conversation before I got here no
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
no was you just said it you just said I
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
said if you act today on this
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes that's not not that you have to it's
 
03:41:45.630 --> 03:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
up to this committee to decide whether
 
03:41:47.870 --> 03:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
they want to approve the bill and or the
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%

shipper or skipp skip okay I'll try to
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
remember Mr Skipper further questions of
 
03:42:23.469 --> 03:42:23.479 align:start position:0%
these two gentlemen from New Hampshire
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
police standards and training yes
 
03:42:27.870 --> 03:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative AB please yes the other
 
03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
thing I just wanted
 
03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:31.229 align:start position:0%
thing I just wanted
to

03:42:31.229 --> 03:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:42:35.229 --> 03:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
Def make sure that I heard it right is
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
the projects that you were thinking
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
about doing but one of them I think that
 
03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
was skipped in there is the ventilation
 
03:42:46.910 --> 03:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
range that's part of it as well uh that
 
03:42:52.830 --> 03:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
sir thank you representative Abbott
 
03:42:56.790 --> 03:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
further questions of these two gentlemen
 
03:42:59.149 --> 03:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee uh the
 
03:43:01.630 --> 03:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
only thing I have a question if let's
 
03:43:03.149 --> 03:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
say you're talking about getting money
 
03:43:06.429 --> 03:43:06.439 align:start position:0%
from uh gopher and other sources if
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
let's say you everything goes your way
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
and you get the money to take care of
 
03:43:13.149 --> 03:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
these projects do you anticipate from
 
03:43:15.269 --> 03:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
what if let's say we pass this bill as
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
amended having any additional money left
 
03:43:19.830 --> 03:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
over I know I realize sometimes projects
 
03:43:22.510 --> 03:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
the bids come in higher Etc do you anti
 
03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
or do you want to you intend to topend
 
03:43:27.309 --> 03:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
it all if we appropriate this bill the
 
03:43:29.550 --> 03:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
way it's
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
amended if we were to receive goer
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
funding for our for our arpa projects
 
03:43:36.870 --> 03:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
that we had including the range up to
 
03:43:40.349 --> 03:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
the amount that it's is needed we would
 
03:43:42.429 --> 03:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
not spend all of these funds they would
 
03:43:44.229 --> 03:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
they would lapse back into the capital
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
fund uh we only if that happens like you
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
said I only want to use this for the
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
money to fix the current boiler problem
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
which is the controllers and a leaky eru
 
03:43:57.790 --> 03:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
unit and and that's that's thermostats
 
03:44:00.429 --> 03:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
that's it and and we would also end the
 
03:44:03.070 --> 03:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
floor and the floor sorry which is a
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
safety issue so whatever's left from
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
that so if let's say you got your all
 
03:44:09.590 --> 03:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
your money from other sources and didn't
 
03:44:11.389 --> 03:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
need to spend all this it just would be
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
return it would be a lapse basically in
 
03:44:14.349 --> 03:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
the next capital budget is that what
 
03:44:16.469 --> 03:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
you're saying probably we'd have to deal
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
with it then as far I mean I'm just I
 
03:44:20.830 --> 03:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how how things will go but
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
yes although we did get an estimate that
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
the Tactical Center floor is going to
 
03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
cost $250,000 okay which was quite a
 
03:44:32.710 --> 03:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
F please would it be safe to say that
 
03:44:39.070 --> 03:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
you guys are trying to be a little
 
03:44:39.080 --> 03:44:40.389 align:start position:0%
you guys are trying to be a little
frugal

03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
frugal
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
and hoping to get the money for the
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
project not counting on what goer may
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
tell you because they that money is
 
03:44:51.149 --> 03:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
constantly revolving because everybody's
 
03:44:53.870 --> 03:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get it so you may say they may
 
03:44:56.550 --> 03:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
say well you're going to get 400,000 you
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
may get 200,000 is that kind of a
 
03:45:01.149 --> 03:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
concern you've got and that's why you're
 
03:45:05.830 --> 03:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.429 --> 03:45:08.439 align:start position:0%
100% represent new further questions
 
03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
from the committee of these two
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
gentleman rep jurus okay go ahead please
 
03:45:16.950 --> 03:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you CH are you at this point is is
 
03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
it is your training center and your your
 
03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
um uh staff ready to put this this money
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
to work by uh by by beginning on The
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
Replacements is the engineering and
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
planning done for for these for this eff
 
03:45:36.510 --> 03:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
for for the controllers we are all set
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
to go to for the boiler controllers
 
03:45:41.070 --> 03:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely and we have two estimates for
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
the flooring so uh and as far as the the
 
03:45:47.349 --> 03:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
arpa projects they've been engineered
 
03:45:49.710 --> 03:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
and quoted and are ready to
 
03:45:53.070 --> 03:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
go so just briefly the sooner the better
 
03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
for you for this 400,000 plus
 
03:45:59.189 --> 03:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
amount okay yeah thank you and the other
 
03:46:03.229 --> 03:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
concern would be uh we cannot um we will
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
need to continue with our uh normal
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
operations we have to continue to train
 
03:46:10.030 --> 03:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
police officers at the same time and so
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh as quick as these might happen uh we
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
also have plans in play to be able to
 
03:46:18.189 --> 03:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
work around our normal operations while
 
03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
these different projects are being
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
completed thank you further questions
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
committee all right I see no more
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you very much for
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
03:46:36.510 --> 03:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time thank you
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
for your
 
03:46:38.600 --> 03:50:41.990 align:start position:0%
for your
time

03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and good afternoon and it's so
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
good to see all of you um I don't think
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
this is a committee that I've spoken to
 
03:50:51.149 --> 03:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
in the recent
 
03:50:53.870 --> 03:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
past um
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
so I come to you today with a
 
03:50:58.560 --> 03:51:01.429 align:start position:0%
so I come to you today with a
bill

03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:51:07.309 --> 03:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:11.950 --> 03:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
1488 you guys all set okay um so I'm
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill hb1
 
03:51:17.590 --> 03:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
1488 to today relative to Hazard
 
03:51:17.600 --> 03:51:19.590 align:start position:0%
1488 to today relative to Hazard
mitigation

03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
03:51:23.790 --> 03:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
funding with this bill I'm asking to
 
03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
place money in the existing Disaster
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
Relief Fund which is found in RSA Pon
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
46a in order to assist towns with
 
03:51:35.590 --> 03:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
limited resources to help them pay for
 
03:51:37.070 --> 03:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
implementation of their Hazard
 
03:51:41.670 --> 03:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
mitigation plans small towns especially
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
often do not have the tax base to afford
 
03:51:46.389 --> 03:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
the huge costs of Hazard mitigation
 
03:51:48.750 --> 03:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
plans many can barely pay for their
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
regular Road and equipment maintenance
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
and they also cannot afford to wait
 
03:51:55.389 --> 03:51:55.399 align:start position:0%
years to save up money to implement
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
costly Hazard mitigation
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
plans given that New Hampshire has been
 
03:52:02.070 --> 03:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
severely impacted by several storms over
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
the past few years resulting in the
 
03:52:06.429 --> 03:52:06.439 align:start position:0%
Declaration of disaster throughout the
 
03:52:08.590 --> 03:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
state and given that New Hampshire has
 
03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
an interest
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
in helping municipalities prevent or
 
03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
reduce the loss of life and damage to
 
03:52:17.149 --> 03:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
property and infrastructure in future
 
03:52:19.189 --> 03:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
natural disasters it would seem that the
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening of Municipal
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is important for the
 
03:52:25.189 --> 03:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
safety Commerce and enjoyment of all New
 
03:52:25.199 --> 03:52:26.229 align:start position:0%
safety Commerce and enjoyment of all New
Hampshire

03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
citizens I believe it is in the interest
 
03:52:30.510 --> 03:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
of citizens of the state to provide a
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
means to assist
 
03:52:34.030 --> 03:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities to implement Hazard
 
03:52:36.189 --> 03:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
mitigation projects and plans to prevent
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
future damage from weather related
 
03:52:40.469 --> 03:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
events and natural disaster
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
Masters the N National Institute of
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
building Sciences did a study that
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
showed enormous benefits in investing in
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
Hazard mitigation plans I sent a copy of
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
the report to the members of this
 
03:52:53.040 --> 03:52:54.750 align:start position:0%
the report to the members of this

03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
life research shows a return of $6 for
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
every dollar invested in mitigation
 
03:53:10.750 --> 03:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
activities that help reduce risk and
 
03:53:13.710 --> 03:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
future disaster losses and furthermore
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
according to
 
03:53:17.710 --> 03:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
ncsl policy makers should consider
 
03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
creating Statewide resilience plans that
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
centralize their approach to dealing
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
with the challenges associated with
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
disasters the reports indicate that
 
03:53:29.630 --> 03:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures for the Federal Emergency
 
03:53:32.110 --> 03:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
Management agency's public assistance
 
03:53:34.429 --> 03:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
program which municipalities seek
 
03:53:36.429 --> 03:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from after a natural
 
03:53:40.670 --> 03:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
disaster alone increased by 23% When
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
comparing the 2000 to 2009 and 2010 to
 
03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
2019 decades the federal government as a
 
03:53:53.710 --> 03:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
whole spent at least $460 billion on
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
disaster costs from 2005 to
 
03:54:01.269 --> 03:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
2019 and we are already hearing that
 
03:54:02.910 --> 03:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
FEMA is beginning to run out of
 
03:54:04.830 --> 03:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement money and that they're
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
backing away from funding reimbursement
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
requests it's been all in the news in
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
the past uh year or two and as a state
 
03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
we have to be prepared to help
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves this bill adds money to an
 
03:54:22.349 --> 03:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
existing fund for purposes of Hazard
 
03:54:24.990 --> 03:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation grant funding and sets up
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
criteria for application for the funding
 
03:54:28.149 --> 03:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
by a
 
03:54:30.429 --> 03:54:30.439 align:start position:0%
municipality the municipality would have
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
to have a municipal Hazard mitigation
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
plan in place to begin with this
 
03:54:37.950 --> 03:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
proposal that I'm offering would just
 
03:54:40.349 --> 03:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
help them get started on implementation
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
which might otherwise be put on the
 
03:54:43.830 --> 03:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
Shelf due to lack of
 
03:54:46.309 --> 03:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
resources these small towns in New
 
03:54:48.830 --> 03:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need our help they simply
 
03:54:50.670 --> 03:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the tax base to do these
 
03:54:53.229 --> 03:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
expensive projects in a timely manner
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
and that exposes them to incredible
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
damage due to weather related in
 
03:55:00.830 --> 03:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
incidents so I thank you and I would be
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you have
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
regarding this um proposed
 
03:55:12.389 --> 03:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
of thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
representative Aon thank you very much
 
03:55:19.990 --> 03:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I appreciate it um
 
03:55:22.389 --> 03:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
and in the interested time Mr chairman I
 
03:55:24.110 --> 03:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
do have four questions so I'll I'll
 
03:55:25.469 --> 03:55:25.479 align:start position:0%
defer to you as to whether I can
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
continue or not so okay I think it's
 
03:55:30.030 --> 03:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
okay if they're not you know four
 
03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions probably I'll ask somebody
 
03:55:33.030 --> 03:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
else I appreciate I appreciate the
 
03:55:34.830 --> 03:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
latitude thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
for letting me know um representative
 
03:55:38.990 --> 03:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
Aaron do you know who administered is
 
03:55:42.510 --> 03:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
the disaster relief fund I believe it is
 
03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
um in the department of
 
03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
safety and uh I believe it is the uh New
 
03:55:49.720 --> 03:55:51.710 align:start position:0%
safety and uh I believe it is the uh New
Hampshire

03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
um Homeland Security emergency
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
management so I think that would be
 
03:55:56.040 --> 03:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
management so I think that would be
director

03:55:57.670 --> 03:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:56:00.990 --> 03:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
buckon follow up Mr chairman thank you
 
03:56:03.070 --> 03:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
how did you arrive at the $2 million
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the bill well it just
 
03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
seems uh to me just based on uh what
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
I've seen in terms of damage in my own
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
town in aworth that um $2 million would
 
03:56:18.269 --> 03:56:18.279 align:start position:0%
have really helped us a lot uh to to to
 
03:56:18.279 --> 03:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
have really helped us a lot uh to to to
help

03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:56:23.990 --> 03:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you know get things put in place and
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know some mitigation plans are
 
03:56:28.429 --> 03:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
more expensive than others we all know
 
03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh as members of our own uh Town select
 
03:56:33.389 --> 03:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
boards or just involved in our town
 
03:56:36.149 --> 03:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
government that the costs of culverts
 
03:56:39.149 --> 03:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
and and ditching and uh even Road
 
03:56:41.710 --> 03:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
diversion you know building a road
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's different from where it is any of
 
03:56:47.149 --> 03:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
these um Hazard mitigation plans can be
 
03:56:50.510 --> 03:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
quite pricey um there's also the issue
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
of you know what our contractor fees
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
have gone up quite a bit costs are
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
expensive for these kinds of projects
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
and um these towns you know they try
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
very hard they try and squirrel away
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
money to do it but then you know you
 
03:57:06.670 --> 03:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
need a new dump truck or you need a new
 
03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
fire TR or you need something
 
03:57:12.510 --> 03:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's a more pressing issue than um you
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
know some some of the plans that the
 
03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
town in good faith puts in place I
 
03:57:19.710 --> 03:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
follow up again Mr chairman please
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
continue thank you on line line 31 of
 
03:57:25.070 --> 03:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
page two of the
 
03:57:27.429 --> 03:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
bill it reads a current copy of the
 
03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
municipal Hazard mitigation plan period
 
03:57:32.550 --> 03:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
is there a legal definition a legal
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
definition to this specific
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
term I'm not sure um okay as far as I
 
03:57:41.269 --> 03:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
understand the hazard mitigation plan
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
that a town comes up with is a document
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh and and most times they work with um
 
03:57:50.910 --> 03:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security emergency management
 
03:57:53.550 --> 03:57:53.560 align:start position:0%

line
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
33 where it says the last two words a
 
03:58:06.189 --> 03:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
declared disaster is this a federal de

declaration or a state declaration
 
03:58:11.950 --> 03:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
well right now we don't have a state
 
03:58:14.269 --> 03:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
declaration I do have another bill and
 
03:58:16.750 --> 03:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
another committee that is seeking to
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
have a state declaration uh that would
 
03:58:23.309 --> 03:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
be made by our uh Commissioner of safety
 
03:58:24.830 --> 03:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the department of safety but right
 
03:58:27.630 --> 03:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
now uh Declaration of disaster would be
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
a presidential declaration thank you I
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%

representative a please yes I just
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
wondered if there was any specific
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
criteria U for
 
03:58:44.760 --> 03:58:46.750 align:start position:0%
criteria U for
qualifying

03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying
 
03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
um for this
 
03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
relief well I had set some uh in in
 
03:58:54.800 --> 03:58:55.950 align:start position:0%
relief well I had set some uh in in
section

03:58:55.950 --> 03:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:58:58.750 --> 03:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
four of
 
03:59:02.149 --> 03:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh from line on page one line
 
03:59:07.389 --> 03:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
28 to uh page two down to line 10 that
 
03:59:10.429 --> 03:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
would have some of the criteria for
 
03:59:17.469 --> 03:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:20.550 --> 03:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
state so so that you would have to
 
03:59:22.590 --> 03:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
provide a current Co the municipality
 
03:59:24.149 --> 03:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
would have to provide a current copy of
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
their Municipal haard mitigation plan a
 
03:59:30.990 --> 03:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
description of the specific project Road
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
or Bridge Project to be implemented and
 
03:59:34.189 --> 03:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
the manner in which the hazard
 
03:59:36.189 --> 03:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
mitigation being implemented improves
 
03:59:38.469 --> 03:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and prevents damage
 
03:59:42.309 --> 03:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
from future natural disasters um item C
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of money being requested for
 
03:59:45.469 --> 03:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
the hazard mitigation project and
 
03:59:47.990 --> 03:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
demonstration of financial need of the
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
municipality for implementing this
 
03:59:52.750 --> 03:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
project an explanation and reasons why
 
03:59:54.750 --> 03:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality is unable to fund the
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
project implementation in a timely
 
03:59:58.229 --> 03:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
manner on its
 
04:00:01.070 --> 04:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
own and any supporting documentation to
 
04:00:03.149 --> 04:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that the infrastructure to
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
be improved and protected is of
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
significant or critical importance to
 
04:00:10.269 --> 04:00:10.279 align:start position:0%
Commerce the citizen safety or provides
 
04:00:12.750 --> 04:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
access through into or out of the
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
municipality and the reasons why I put
 
04:00:18.309 --> 04:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
that there is because you know um it's
 
04:00:20.189 --> 04:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
one thing to to do some Hazard
 
04:00:24.630 --> 04:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
mitigation on some side dirt road but I
 
04:00:26.309 --> 04:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
think it's more important for these
 
04:00:28.910 --> 04:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
projects to be done for the more heavily
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
traveled roads where Commerce is
 
04:00:32.910 --> 04:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
happening in and out of a town and
 
04:00:35.790 --> 04:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
municipality maybe you've got um a maple
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
sugar farm a dairy farm a blueberry pick
 
04:00:42.870 --> 04:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
your own blueberry whatever those roads
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
that are more typically used for
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
Commerce or for Traverse through and in
 
04:00:50.349 --> 04:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
and out of the municipality of course
 
04:00:52.750 --> 04:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
we'd want to protect those and those are
 
04:00:55.030 --> 04:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
become more of a priority than the other
 
04:00:57.710 --> 04:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of roads in town thank you thank
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you m thank you Mr chair
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
and thanks for answering my
 
04:01:14.830 --> 04:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
question section three um mentions a
 
04:01:18.389 --> 04:01:18.399 align:start position:0%
once in the calendar year a grant being
 
04:01:20.830 --> 04:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
available for up to 50,000 is that
 
04:01:24.149 --> 04:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
really going to do much for some of the
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
problems that people you're talking
 
04:01:28.469 --> 04:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
about big problems excuse me yeah sure
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
um let's see you said section three
 
04:01:33.670 --> 04:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
which page was that on oh yes yes page
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
one I'm sorry um well I thought that you
 
04:01:41.189 --> 04:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
know that might be um a good start for a
 
04:01:44.349 --> 04:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
municipality maybe they don't maybe that
 
04:01:46.510 --> 04:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
$50,000 is something that's preventing
 
04:01:48.790 --> 04:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
them from getting started I mean I don't
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
think it's up to the state to fund an
 
04:01:53.790 --> 04:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
entire project but I think if the if the
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
state can offer some portion of that
 
04:01:59.950 --> 04:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
funding it would really go a long way
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
especially in these smaller towns uh to
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
help get a project going and get it off
 
04:02:09.550 --> 04:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
the ground as opposed to
 
04:02:13.710 --> 04:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
being you know so so expensive that um
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
the town can't afford it so I it was
 
04:02:19.469 --> 04:02:19.479 align:start position:0%
just a number that I thought was
 
04:02:22.790 --> 04:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable um and again the intent of
 
04:02:27.070 --> 04:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is not necessarily to fund an
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
an entire mitigation plan but at least
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
to help the municipality get started in
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
um in implementing
 
04:02:41.910 --> 04:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you again Mr chairman I
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate and I thank the general lady
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
for for taking my questions I appreciate
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
it page three of the bill um section
 
04:02:54.149 --> 04:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
three where you have a uh a committee
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
going be comprised of a nonprofit
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
Community Human Service organizations
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
disastrous Disaster Response cap
 
04:03:01.840 --> 04:03:03.030 align:start position:0%
disastrous Disaster Response cap
Municipal

04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
organization and I noticed that
 
04:03:06.269 --> 04:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
Municipal organization was highlighted
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
in italicize so is this existing
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
language and that we're adding Municipal
 
04:03:12.670 --> 04:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
because I really felt it should be
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
better to find the whole thing yeah that
 
04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
if we're going to if if the bill is
 
04:03:18.750 --> 04:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to have some type of a Disaster
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
Relief Committee that it be more
 
04:03:23.149 --> 04:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted as opposed to
 
04:03:26.349 --> 04:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
having a generic generic titles To Who
 
04:03:28.110 --> 04:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
It compris of this particular committee
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question that's a
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
very good question yes it is amending
 
04:03:35.189 --> 04:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
existing statute okay um the existing
 
04:03:38.110 --> 04:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
statute I guess was meant um primarily
 
04:03:39.830 --> 04:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
individuals although I don't know that
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
any individuals have ever ever made use
 
04:03:45.790 --> 04:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
of this
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
statute um so what I when I saw this uh
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
that a fund has already been developed
 
04:03:54.429 --> 04:03:54.439 align:start position:0%
which by the
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
way um right now as I understand only
 
04:04:00.630 --> 04:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
contains about
 
04:04:05.229 --> 04:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
$45,000 um what I thought was to amend
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
this language that's existing in statute
 
04:04:09.149 --> 04:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
to include municipalities so that
 
04:04:12.429 --> 04:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities can have a a statutory
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.990 --> 04:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
funding Fallout Mr chairman thank you
 
04:04:20.590 --> 04:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
and then on section
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
four the maintenance of the records of
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
dispersements uh Disaster Relief
 
04:04:28.229 --> 04:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
Committee line 11 every six months
 
04:04:30.030 --> 04:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
following the effective date of the the
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
section I guess my question to you is
 
04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with six months
 
04:04:36.030 --> 04:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
because I felt that maybe depending on
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
the nature of of
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
the municipality applying for disaster
 
04:04:43.670 --> 04:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
relief may require a higher frequency of
 
04:04:47.950 --> 04:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
of review well this was uh again in
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
current statute and I believe the the
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security
 
04:04:55.630 --> 04:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
emergency management um is required to
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
make this report every six months I
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
didn't know that it was would be
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
necessary to make it any um you know
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
sooner sooner sooner frequency I mean if
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
if the committee feels that um
 
04:05:11.189 --> 04:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
any set any other language in the
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
existing statute needs to be amended or
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
should be amended for clarity or for
 
04:05:18.149 --> 04:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
purposes of expediency I'd be more than
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
happy to put in an amendment or work
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
with you to do that or however you want
 
04:05:24.189 --> 04:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
to do it it's it would be your bill
 
04:05:26.349 --> 04:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
right now any yep I ruin that term
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
earlier this
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
morning okay but I I'm I'm more than
 
04:05:32.349 --> 04:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
open to have you make any kinds of
 
04:05:34.750 --> 04:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
changes to existing statute as I tried
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
to no I appreciate it thank you for your
 
04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr chairman void further
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative Aaron from
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee are there any
 
04:05:45.710 --> 04:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
other questions want to be sure oh yes
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
just one more comment thank you for the
 
04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
report oh sure I appreciate the
 
04:05:52.349 --> 04:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
hyperlink thank you yeah no the the
 
04:05:56.149 --> 04:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
reports are are very useful I know um
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
one of them is very lengthy and goes
 
04:06:01.870 --> 04:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
into uh quite a lot of detail in
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
specific hazard mitigation 659 Pages
 
04:06:07.950 --> 04:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
exactly but there are uh there are part
 
04:06:10.149 --> 04:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
of that report I think that that makes
 
04:06:12.910 --> 04:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
some very Salient points
 
04:06:16.149 --> 04:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
about when we do Hazard mitigation we
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
are saving ourselves a lot of money we
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
are we are pre helping to prevent future
 
04:06:27.269 --> 04:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
loss of life of resources property um
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
all of those things and as we see with
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
more the frequency of these kinds of
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
flooding events that we've had we had a
 
04:06:38.990 --> 04:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
flood in July 2021 another in in
 
04:06:41.670 --> 04:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
2023 and it's not
 
04:06:46.149 --> 04:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
because um it's not necessarily
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
because uh the damage that's being done
 
04:06:51.550 --> 04:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily because of the
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
flooding in particular but it's because
 
04:06:56.910 --> 04:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
we haven't really kept up with a lot of
 
04:06:59.950 --> 04:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure to harden it to more
 
04:07:03.550 --> 04:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
severe kinds of weather we also have an
 
04:07:05.429 --> 04:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
issue with I
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
feel with the way in which we do or
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't do are stream management you have
 
04:07:13.229 --> 04:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of streams that are backed up and
 
04:07:15.469 --> 04:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
blocked up with debris that have not
 
04:07:18.429 --> 04:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
been cleared over the years and maybe
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's a fault of our own Department of
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services who believes that
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
um when a stream is blocked up and it
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
gets diverted around and then threatens
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
buildings or whatever yes you can fix
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
that but they're but they belief is that
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
these streams go through a Natural
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
Evolution and we shouldn't disturb the
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
stream beds and we shouldn't disturb the
 
04:07:48.189 --> 04:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
habitats of animals that set up life
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
there but by the same token I mean we've
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
got property that's involved and lives
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
that are involved and roadways that are
 
04:07:58.750 --> 04:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
involved and I think that um to say that
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
we should leave things alone after a
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
flood and let things happen is not
 
04:08:07.950 --> 04:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
really a good policy I mean we we really
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
ought to be when when these streams run
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
their Banks and they bring down a lot of
 
04:08:16.109 --> 04:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
rock and vegetation and silt those
 
04:08:17.910 --> 04:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
things should be cleared out so that the
 
04:08:19.950 --> 04:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
stream can function
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
properly as it was before um so I I find
 
04:08:25.469 --> 04:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
that there's an aspect of stream
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
management there's an aspect of also um
 
04:08:31.950 --> 04:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
doing our due diligence in maintaining
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
our roadways our
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
bridges and um and making sure that
 
04:08:40.349 --> 04:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
flooding doesn't happen where where
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
we've seen it so I think
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
um the hazard mitigation for for at
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
least any of the flooding that we've
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
been seeing experiencing in many of our
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
towns um is a great investment and I
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
think the state needs to help these
 
04:09:01.149 --> 04:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
towns um bring these projects to
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
fruition and um I I hope that you would
 
04:09:08.269 --> 04:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
consider that I think uh a grant
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
um system would go a long way to help
 
04:09:10.640 --> 04:09:11.389 align:start position:0%
um system would go a long way to help
our

04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:09:14.429 --> 04:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
towns and um especially the towns that
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
are in need I mean aworth and I don't
 
04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
want to keep talking about aworth but
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's you know the town I live in and
 
04:09:24.670 --> 04:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
um we have an operating budget of $1.3
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
million it's not a big town we've got
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
850 voters or 850 people that live in
 
04:09:35.149 --> 04:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
town um so our tax base is limited and
 
04:09:38.109 --> 04:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
we can only afford to do so much
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
and when the other thing I want to point
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
out too is that when these flooding
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
events happen an a town works with FEMA
 
04:09:50.189 --> 04:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
first of all you know that's a takes a
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
long time we're still it's three years
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
from the 2021 flood we're still waiting
 
04:09:57.389 --> 04:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement money from FEMA so I
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean the money is not forthcoming it's a
 
04:10:02.830 --> 04:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic mess it's it's horrific for
 
04:10:06.189 --> 04:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
our towns who are uh Limited in the
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
amount of people they have in
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
administration to work and do their own
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
work but also do all the reporting
 
04:10:15.469 --> 04:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
necessary you might not have a very
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
um FEMA when when they reimburse your
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
money you are working on a project to
 
04:10:30.670 --> 04:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
put the road back to where it was before
 
04:10:34.109 --> 04:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
the flooding event that doesn't include
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
mitigation so why would you fix
 
04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
something to be the the same way that it
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
was before and have yourself put at risk
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
to have the same flooding incident the
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
same damage be done again and then if
 
04:10:51.109 --> 04:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
you look at one of our roads in aworth
 
04:10:54.910 --> 04:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
cranebrook Road um that was taken out
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
totally the entire two three miles of it
 
04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
was totally destroyed in
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
2021 and because there was no mitigation
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
money we put the road back to the way it
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
was before
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
and guess what when 2023 came around and
 
04:11:13.109 --> 04:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
we had that flooding in July the entire
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
Road was washed out again totally
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
destroyed and so all that money and time
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
well and we we didn't even finish we
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
only got temporary work done um all that
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
time and money was wasted because we
 
04:11:31.149 --> 04:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
didn't really put in the kind of Road
 
04:11:34.030 --> 04:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
plan that would have fixed the kinds of
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
problems that we were having to begin
 
04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
with and so it's a problem and um and I
 
04:11:43.229 --> 04:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
and I think um some grant money being
 
04:11:45.309 --> 04:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
made available to municipalities will go
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
a long way to fix these kinds of
 
04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
problems thank
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
you uh further question repr Aon from
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
the committee uh before I did everybody
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.950 --> 04:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
us now okay and and this information you
 
04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
gave you some hard
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
only a few copies but I have a link to
 
04:12:12.109 --> 04:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
that in the email that I sent okay
 
04:12:14.670 --> 04:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
that's that same information yes sir I
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
do have
 
04:12:21.309 --> 04:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
hard we have a hard y okay so again any
 
04:12:21.319 --> 04:12:22.750 align:start position:0%
hard we have a hard y okay so again any
other

04:12:22.750 --> 04:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:12:26.269 --> 04:12:26.279 align:start position:0%

04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
stopped thinking about
 
04:32:02.349 --> 04:32:02.359 align:start position:0%
it let me ask you this though last time
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
we went
 
04:32:04.479 --> 04:38:33.910 align:start position:0%
we went
this

04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.920 --> 05:08:14.270 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
right all right okay I'm sorry okay
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Jack so
 
05:08:32.350 --> 05:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
everybody hear me so I we've just talked
 
05:08:34.030 --> 05:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
with the chair and I think we've talked
 
05:08:36.510 --> 05:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor and probably
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
because it was a mistake that the chair
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
myself and I don't know you can blame
 
05:08:42.548 --> 05:08:42.558 align:start position:0%
other people to I want to get blame
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
because we all make mistakes that this
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
should have gone to Science Tech and
 
05:08:50.590 --> 05:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
energy so what we want to do is recess
 
05:08:53.150 --> 05:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
this hearing and hopefully the clerk and
 
05:08:55.628 --> 05:08:55.638 align:start position:0%
the speaker whatever can figure it out
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
and either they'll reassign it to
 
05:08:58.910 --> 05:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
Science Tech and or they'll change the
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
heading and will come back to our for
 
05:09:04.230 --> 05:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
another public he hearing and give the
 
05:09:08.110 --> 05:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
bill its due uh wherever it goes because
 
05:09:09.868 --> 05:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
uh we just have a problem that we
 
05:09:12.590 --> 05:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
screwed up and to be fair to the
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
sponsors we don't we want to at least
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing of the bill so
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
what we're going to I'm going to do is
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess the public hearing
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
1510 and let the clerk and the speaker
 
05:09:27.868 --> 05:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
figure it out and and it may come back
 
05:09:29.948 --> 05:09:29.958 align:start position:0%
but we it probably they'll have to
 
05:09:31.548 --> 05:09:31.558 align:start position:0%
change the heading or otherwise it
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably will go to Science Tech and
 
05:09:34.830 --> 05:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
energy and I want to on behalf of the
 
05:09:37.548 --> 05:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee apologize to the prime sponsor
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
sorry for the mixup uh thank you very
 
05:09:42.910 --> 05:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
much for taking care of this error and I
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to encourage everybody on
 
05:09:46.788 --> 05:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
this committee to at least read the
 
05:09:48.670 --> 05:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
article that I handed out understanding
 
05:09:50.110 --> 05:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
that I may not actually be able to
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
present to you in the future I may be
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
going elsewhere but big exciting and
 
05:09:55.470 --> 05:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
interesting things are happening with
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
Eves and our grid in New Hampshire um
 
05:09:59.548 --> 05:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
and I think that this is a great
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a commission which is
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
why I brought forth the bill so uh
 
05:10:04.548 --> 05:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
please take that under consideration I
 
05:10:06.150 --> 05:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
hope I'm back to present to you but if
 
05:10:09.430 --> 05:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not thank you for your time okay and
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's important because this may
 
05:10:13.470 --> 05:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
come back or come on the floor so I
 
05:10:15.310 --> 05:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
think it's important we all at least
 
05:10:17.548 --> 05:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
understand the one side of the issue and
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
then hopefully make an intelligent
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
much 151 and again thank you very much
 
05:10:29.350 --> 05:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
point of order I thought you we were
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
going into recess oh recess you can't
 
05:10:32.080 --> 05:10:32.990 align:start position:0%
going into recess oh recess you can't
you

05:10:32.990 --> 05:10:33.000 align:start position:0%

05:10:34.990 --> 05:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
can't you can't close the hearing you
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.958 --> 05:11:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
15

05:11:18.750 --> 05:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:21.310 --> 05:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
okay so that concludes today's
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
activities uh again I ask you to leave
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
your name plates on your desk because
 
05:11:28.350 --> 05:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
I've got to work with the administrative
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
assistant the chair to make sure we know
 
05:11:32.910 --> 05:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
who's sitting where so when we come back
 
05:11:35.310 --> 05:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
the name plates are in the proper place
 
05:11:36.750 --> 05:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
I know some members of the committee are
 
05:11:38.230 --> 05:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
not here but hopefully everybody's
 
05:11:40.110 --> 05:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
satisfied with where they're
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
sitting um if not let myself know or the
 
05:11:45.910 --> 05:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
chair but and those who didn't come
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
today are going to have to be satisfied
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
with the choices they have left and
 
05:11:51.390 --> 05:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
again thank you very much everybody
 
05:11:53.310 --> 05:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate your patience again sorry for
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.878 --> 05:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
 
okay
