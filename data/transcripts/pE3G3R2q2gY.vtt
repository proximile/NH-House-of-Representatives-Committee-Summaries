00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
1185 which is the um human um sex
 
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
education um bill I want to preface my
 
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
testimony by telling you that um I've
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
been a registered nurse since
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
1991 um a majority of my practice was as
 
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
a school nurse um and my largest school
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
was 500 students um ages prek through
 
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.710 align:start position:0%
was 500 students um ages prek through
fifth

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
fifth
 
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
grade and I would like to also say
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
that sex is an adult activity with adult
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
consequences during the periods between
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
preschool and High School is a time of
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
tremendous growth both physical
 
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
emotional and mental and academic growth
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
learning does not stop once a student
 
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
graduates as Educators you are aware
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
that we are trying to um produce
 
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
lifelong Learners sex ed should continue
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
at an age appropriate level after high
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
school so my point being we shouldn't
 
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
have to feel like we need to cram
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
everything in before they graduate
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of time to learn when
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
graduate there is currently a trend
 
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
toward the adoption of planned
 
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
parenthood's comprehensive sex ed also
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
known as csse curriculum in K12
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
classrooms throughout the country I
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
would like to provide my rationale for
 
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
why New Hampshire should not follow suit
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood has been deeply
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
involved in setting the national sex
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
sexuality education standards or NES
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
from which they benefit via millions of
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
dollars in Grants from the US Department
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services to provide
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum a significant conflict of
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
interest they are using these standards
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
in related curriculum to promote a
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
radical gender ideology that denies
 
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
science and creates dangerous conflicts
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
between parents and their children and
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
between the child and their own psyche
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
the csse endorses moral relativism of
 
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
controversial sexual behaviors and
 
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
relationships that are in conflict with
 
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
most American cultural norms religious
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
beliefs and family values Planned
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
Parenthood is a sec is the second
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
largest supplier of cross- sex hormones
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
in this country so it is obvious their
 
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
interest in controlling the sexual
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
education of our young people is purely
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
economic and not for social good in
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
addition Planned Parenthood is one of
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
the largest providers of abortions in
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
this country and benefit financially
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
from unintended
 
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
pregnancies a com a common criticism of
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood developed NES
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
standard is that they expose children to
 
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
age impro in age inappropriate sexual
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
material and this is where I personally
 
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
have an issue robbing them of their
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
innocence and increasing the potential
 
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
for Contracting sexually transmitted
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
diseases or experiencing psychological
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
damage for example csse teaches gender
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
ID identity to kindergarteners and trans
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
to kindergarteners and trans
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
gender transgender puberty blockers to
 
00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
third graders a related teacher resource
 
00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
suggests sterilization as a form of
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
birth control to 11 to 13y olds it also
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
suggests withholding information about a
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
gender's identity confusion from parents
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
and the main curriculum strives to
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
encourage children to seek counsel from
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
trusted adults rather than their parents
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
while paying lip service to parents'
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
roles in nurturing their children's know
 
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.149 align:start position:0%
roles in nurturing their children's know
of

00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:34.039 align:start position:0%
sexuality in addition csse includes irre
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
irrelevant content to promote their
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
gender ideology agenda and fails to
 
00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
focus the curriculum on topic at hand
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
the life behaviors of a sexually healthy
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
adult include statement like interact
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
with all genders instead of both in
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
respectful and appropriate ways affirm
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
one's own gender identities and respect
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
the gender identities of others so if a
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
child were to affirm that there are only
 
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
male and female genders as a as science
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
holds true the child would be considered
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
unhealthy according to these guidelines
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
for example the subconcepts are rif with
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
statements such as reject stereotyp
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
stereotypes about the sexuality of
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
different populations avoid behaviors
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
to do with sex ed for the purpose of
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
avoiding STDs and unintended pregnancies
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
the Planned Parenthood curriculum is
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%

many one we are a Melting Pot people
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
come to America from many cultures but
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
are expected and need to assimilate to
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
our culture which is based on
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
judeo-christian values enshrined in our
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
founding documents we need our children
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
to be educated to a value system that is
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
compatible and consistent with these
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
American values the concern here is that
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
large populations of migrants and even
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
legal immigrants who have not
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
assimilated to the American values is
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
leading to an increase in femicide and
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
violence against homosexuals in our
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
country quite a bit of curriculum is
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
spent on sexual orientation and dend
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
gender identity ideology rather than on
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
material relevant to heterosexuals which
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
make up the vast majority of the
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
population in this state the material
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
also has misleading statements such as
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
two people who live together without
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
being married can have the same
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
commitment and responsibility toward one
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
another as married people this is not
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
true as marriage involves certain legal

commitments rights and benefits that are
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
not conferred on common law cohabitants
 
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
the material appears to have a bias
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
against traditional marriage and
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
um propo us to propose this legislation
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
is I had been following the
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
comprehensive sex education as it
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
migrated from California to to
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
Connecticut in the east coast our
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
executive committee um stopped funding
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
for this um this type of sex ed because
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
they found problems with the curriculum
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
they found that um it did in fact speak
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
out both sides of its mouth it told
 
00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
parents you know it presented you know
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be to have parents
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
involved in the process and being
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
transparent yet once the students were
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
in the classroom
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
they told the kids like Las Vegas what
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
stays in this CL what happens in this
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
classroom stays in this classroom now
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
all those children bring different
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
things to the table um by not being able
 
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
to discuss what they're learning with
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
their parents Guardians grandparents
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
whoever that's going to cause a conflict
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
with students we in the United States
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
are Melting Pot of so many beautiful
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful cultures that each have their
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
own views around what they want their
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
kids to know about family life if we are
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
pushing these these these tenants on
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
kids who you know who don't whose
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
families and cultures don't espouse this
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're causing unnecessary conflict so um
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
the executive committee halted the
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
funding and said no you know this is not
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate for our schools however
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Hassan uh Maggie Hassen went and
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
secured funding through am muskog health
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
have a Bachelor of Science and health
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
education um and I taught sex education
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
for probably 30 out of my 35 years um
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
our it was a two- we section um that
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
occurred in our health education grade
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
nine and when it was started uh and
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
throughout we had Parents um on come in
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
and uh discuss what was going on in the
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
sex education uh part of the health
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
education and offer suggestions and and
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
whatever they the comments they wanted
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
to make um because before for a number
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
of years te uh parents weren't really
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to exempt their kids from sex
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
education now um today if a parent first
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
of all the information that is provided
 
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
is given out 14 days before the health
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
education class uh reviews that and then
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
parents are allowed to actually um
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
withdraw from that section of the course
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
and provide their own
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
information um to so that some
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
information is getting to the student so
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody objects to this
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
they're they have every opportunity to
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw from it if it's not part of
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
their value
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
system they can withdraw from this part
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
of the the um course so uh first of all
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that this bill is
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because of those guidelines
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
secondly I want to I can't I'm getting
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
nervous because I I just can't deal with
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
teachers indoctrination teachers don't
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
indoctrinate okay they offer skills they
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
offer learning they offer content
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
area my job teachers jobs are not to
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
browbeat kids to a certain system so
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's also a dangerous bill
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
because if kids don't get accurate sex
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
education if they don't learn things
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
from people like School nurses people
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
who have a degree in health
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
education they are learning from their
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
peers they are learning from those
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
pornographic magazines they can get
 
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
either at the store or online they are
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
learning from adults who want to do
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
different things to them that may not be
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate and may be very dangerous
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
so it's dangerous not to have sex
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
education and as our previous speaker
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
said representative can you please wrap
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
it up you've gone by your two minutes
 
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
that the majority of parents and
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
students the youth advisory committee
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
actually two years ago had a panel
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
discussion on why we weren't doing more
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
sex education uh want sex education want
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
the diversity in school want social
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
emotional learning and I've passed out a
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
sheet um that tells you uh what should
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
what I think should happen and what does
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
happen in schools and also a little note
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
at the top that uh people are passing
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
through puberty earlier and earlier now
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
it's 8 to13 for girls and a girl
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
ovulates before we've got that sheet in
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
front of us so we're going to have toang
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
quits here okay G are there any
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative Tanner yes
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you Mr chair and
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here you had
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
indicated in your testimony
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
that uh parents are involved in the
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
program and in fact they can exempt
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
their child if they want to how many
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
parents in your 30 years of history of
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
teaching this course have Exempted their
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
child from being involved in this
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
program probably less than 10 thank you
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you Mr chair and
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um you
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
indicated that indoctrination doesn't
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
happen in schools it's not something
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
teachers are doing uh as it relates to
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
this bill but the the simple definition
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
of an indoctrinate is simply to instruct
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
in a body of Doctrine or principles is
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
that not what we're discussing here is
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
not isn't everything to do with how
 
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:53.799 align:start position:0%
sexual legation is taught and what it is
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
a matter of Doctrine and principles this
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
this um whole push about
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
indoctrination is and I wish I could use
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
the term but it is totally misinformed
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
and misdirected you can take any
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
definition you want but teachers are our
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
whole profession is set up to to not
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
allow like not allow students or not to
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
inform students as to what our religion
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
is what our political ideology is what
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
our values are as far as
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
sex education is concerned that's not
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
the job the job is to inform kids to
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
give them the skills to give them
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
critical thinking so that and
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
decision-making skills so that they can
 
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:41.799 align:start position:0%
make their own decisions this happens to
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
be one of the areas that's very
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
important that parents are involved in
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
and that I know the previous speaker
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
said that you know in one class they
 
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
heard you know it's like Las Vegas
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
whatever is said in this class only
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
stays in this class that doesn't pertain
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
to the um education that's happening in
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
that class that pertains to the
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
questions other students ask um so that
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
a student doesn't go home and say you
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
know representative Miler ask a question
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
about blah blah blah um but in my class
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
and I think I would say that 90% of the
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
people that teach it have different
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
parts in the class where you're supposed
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
to go home and talk to your parents it's
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's so that the parents get to
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
give their read on the situation and and
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
what and the values they want to
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
instill further questions represent P
 
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
now thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
my question I believe I heard you say
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
that students
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
need to have sex education and I'm
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
confused because I don't think this Bill
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
is saying that students shouldn't have
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
it it's just giving a different an
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
alternative to what you're suggesting
 
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
the students need is that well let me
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
let me point out to you particularly on
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
page three okay sections 6 7 8 and N um
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
tie the hand of a person who's trying to
 
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
a trained professional way information
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
and skill building activities evidence
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
formed inclusive
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus youth trauma informed and
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
adap Ed to the needs of the community
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
totally totally binds the hands of of a
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
teacher that's trying to effectively
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
teach sex
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
education represent cascaden did you
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
have your hand up um I did um just doing
 
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit of research it appears that
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
across the country there are four states
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
that have the best um curriculum for sex
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
education right now New Hampshire is one
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
of those four but also I want to know if
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
um I know the curriculum does not
 
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.029 align:start position:0%
um I know the curriculum does not
require

00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
consent I knew that the curriculum did
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
not require including instruction and
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation or gender identity
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
but is the curriculum being used still
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
the health curriculum that was
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
developed um and is listed on the
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
department of Ed is that still going on
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
in schools is that what they're using
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
so the the fact about across the state
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire unless it's drastically
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
changed was that health education
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
although it was required by the
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
standards it is was often taught by the
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
physical education coach or you know to
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
take the girls one day and the boys the
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
other day and give them the film and a
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
little talk and answer some questions
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
right and um even when the legislative
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
youth uh group did a panel and did some
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
investigation and what sex education was
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
being taught across the state of New
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it was still just just really
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
a hodgepodge I think
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
the the schools that adopt set
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum like that often are are
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
schools that have people who aren't
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
professional uh in that particular um
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
subject and so they they try to do it
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
that way further questions from the
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative pel thank
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
you um representative Tanner can you
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
explain to me what the specific purpose
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
of sex
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.350 align:start position:0%
of sex
is

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
well um I'm not sure that um I'm an
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
expert in that but definitely uh sex has
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
reproduction and sex has to also do with
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't know where to go from there
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a stumper question thank

sidel the the card says 15 minutes but
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
we're to down to the
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
you well thank you Mr
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um part of the reason
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
a big part of the reason for this bill
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
when I was
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
campaigning with most people that I
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
spoke to I would say about 80% of the
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
people that I spoke to door too I asked
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
them what was your biggest issue and
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
about 80% of the time it was schools
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
school safety we had recently had in the
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
news a shooting that had happened I'm
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't introduce myself uh
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sidell Sheila Sidell from
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 2019 um and co-sponsored to
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
the bill um the biggest concern was the
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
schools as far far as safety as well as
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
what children are being taught that
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
they're not learning they're not their
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
proficiency is way down and what they're
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
also being taught that parents do not
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
want um discuss they want to to have for
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
themselves and that would having to do
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
with sexual education um this bill in no
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
way is to deny that there are trans
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
youth that there are lgbtqq youth it is
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
to put this back in the hands of the
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
parents they need the children need to
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
have biology
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
physiology explained to them and and how
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
that all comes to to play they don't
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
need their sexual Lifestyles told to
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
them given all the different options
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
that are out there for sexual Lifestyles
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
there's 107 of um gender identities
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's eight different sexual
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
orientations that in itself takes four
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
years of gender studies in college to
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
get an an adult student to understand
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
what the complexities are of this topic
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
and we're putting it in the minds of
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
young children that don't have the
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
mental capacity if it takes four years
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
for an adult student to understand it
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
how are we going to have a child that is
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
way younger than that understand it
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
um the other side of it is we
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
have 67 to 95% depending on the study
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
you look at 67 to 95% of these students
 
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.789 align:start position:0%
you look at 67 to 95% of these students
that

00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
um are hearing this information by the
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
time they're 18 they have accepted their
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
birth gender they're they're no longer
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
confused because they are now getting to
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
the maturity where they they're getting
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with who they
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
are um so that is I it really is it it's
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
been brought forward by the parents that
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to by the grandparents I've
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
spoken to and the teachers that I've
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
spoken to that are that are trying to
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
figure out where can they where they
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
walk on this this very narrow path
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's been created thank you very much
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of the
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
representative yes representa

cordelli uh thank you um I just wanted
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
to uh touch on I think it's both in the
 
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
original bill and the amendment um
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
Romans 6 uh uh talks about what shall
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
not be included in um instruction or
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
provision of
 
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.430 align:start position:0%
provision of
materials

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
um which includes gender uh expression
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
um orientation and Lifestyles as you as
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
you mentioned but also um included is um
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
in Roman 9 UM the uh anti-discrimination
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
statutes which um prevent discrimination
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
on any one of those topics um can you
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
tell me how that um six and nine apply
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
to each
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
other well in six it's telling us what
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
we can what we can or cannot expose the
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
children to
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination means not singling out
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
one not and that's the opposite of of
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
inclusivity um we are to teach them in a
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
more broad subject not isolating into
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
one particular area and and certainly
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
not um exposing them to materials that
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
they're mentally not capable of of
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
processing thank you thank you further
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%

186 colon 11a it'll be one less thing
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
for the schools to to have why would you
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
go repe why wouldn't you repeal instead

education will be taught by a registered
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
nurse and no human sexual education

instructed teacher shall do it um there
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
are many schools that don't have a nurse
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
at all um in New Hampshire and they're
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
pretty busy so if they don't if a school
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a nurse and they don't have
 
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
time to do it this doesn't happen
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%

Trumble good morning Mr chairman
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David

Trumble from the town of where I'm
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
first of all comprehensive sex education
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
does more than prevent teen pregnancies
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
it also reduces Dating Violence and it
 
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
reduces children's sex abuse by teaching
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
children at an early stage about not
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
being touched inappropriately studies
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
show a 30-year study that comprehensive
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
sex head reduces child sex abuse and it
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
reduces Dating Violence that's from the
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
American Academy Pediatrics and also the
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
Journal of adolescent
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
Health another problem with this bill is
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
that it basically writes lgbtq issues
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
out of sex education they're not
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
included in the areas that are mandated
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
to be instructed and they are
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
specifically included in the areas that
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
are precluded from being instructed
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
having a program that teaches about
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
lgbtq issues leads to a safe and
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
welcoming school and it reduces bullying
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
that three decade study at actually was
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
a review of 80s studies showed that when
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
you have a good LGBT Q courses as part
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
of your comprehensive sex ed you reduce
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
bullying and you increase awareness of
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination and oppression it also
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
goes on to talk about um how uh
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
decreased is the name calling in
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
willingness to intervene when witnessing
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
name calling by others and an increase
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
in a belief that children and people
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
have the right to be who they are and
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'll submit written testimony so you can
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
review that for yourself but the point
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
is basically that this sort of a bill
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
would result in ignorance because
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
children will not be getting taught at
 
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
all about
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
lgbtq and they need that sex education
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
is effective when it's properly
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
presented and that should be an
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
important part of what's done the last
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
objection to this bill is the section
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
seven that says it's reserved solely for
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
that class what happens in other
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
classrooms like for instance when a
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
teacher has lgbtq books on their
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
bookshelf must they now be removed and
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
if that teacher doesn't would they lose
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
their teaching license this bill is so
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
vague that I think it basically would
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
intimidate teachers from even addressing
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
the question any kind of a teacher
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's an English teacher or or a
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
nurse or a phys that teacher or a
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
science teacher uh with only two minutes
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if you've written
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we'd appreciate that being
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
submitted to the yes sir represent
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you um thank you for
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
your testimony this morning um could you
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
tell me where in statute it says that
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
lgbtq issues are to be taught in sexual
 
00:36:26.319 --> 00:36:27.910 align:start position:0%
lgbtq issues are to be taught in sexual
education

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
where where in statute it's the the bill
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
or in current Statute in current statute
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
I I don't I I'm not saying that it is
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
mandated in current statute but it's not
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
prohibited in current statute and I
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
believe it is a part of what's called
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive sex education the prime
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill was speaking against
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
that and what I'm I was citing to you a
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
study of comprehensive sex said that
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
says including lgbtq issues reduces
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
bullying and uh M discrimination could
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
you provide us a copy of that study
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
possi I I have in the evidence of
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll give you there's a direct
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
link it's okay thank you it's it's
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
called three decades of research the
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
case for comprehensive sex education
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's in the Journal of adolescent Health
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
October of 2020 thank you thank you very
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
much further questions yes
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for being
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
here would you agree or would you
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
comment on this is actually followup to
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's question to the
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
previous speaker um Romans 6 and Roman
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
9 isn't it a conflict to prohibit in
 
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.030 align:start position:0%
9 isn't it a conflict to prohibit in
Romans

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
Romans
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
6 any instruction or provision of
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
materials regarding I won't read the
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
whole thing but gender identity gender
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
expression Etc and then to say to quote
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
RSA 354 in Roman 9 this act prohibits
 
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination against age sex gender
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
identity sexual orientation if you
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
ignore gender identity aren't you
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
discriminating against it I would agree
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
with your thank you representative Damon
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
I would agree with your interpretation I
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
think the authors of this are trying to
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
say in section six we're writing lgbtq
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
out there will be no discussion of it in
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
sexed or anywhere else in the school
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
they don't exist from an educational
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint but we're not going to allow
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
anybody to say anything directly that
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
would discriminate against somebody so
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to write you out of
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
existence but if somebody says something
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
against you then you would be up against
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
a discrimination law thank you thank you
 
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.150 align:start position:0%
a discrimination law thank you thank you
represent

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:40.839 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh you testified that uh
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill the lgbtq issues are are
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
written out of the sexuality education
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
which is currently a part of
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive sex sexuality education um
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
so in in current and when I was there
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
sexuality education consisted of
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
learning about things like penile
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
vaginal intercourse how it can result in
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
a child and how diseases can be
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
transmitted in that way can you with
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
some degree of specificity identify what
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
lgbtq issues are or should be taught in
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
this class thank you representative
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
beler so the study that I cited on
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive sex education said that
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's generally agreed that that sex
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
education reduces sexually transmitted
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
diseases and reduces teenage pregnancy
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
this study looked at what are the other
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
things that can be included in
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive sex education and are they
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial and they looked at it and
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
said it reduces Dating Violence it
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
reduces child sex abuse and it reduces
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
bullying so there are more things than
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
just focusing on sexually transmitted
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
diseases and teen pregnancy those are
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
certainly core components but the the
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
point is is that comprehensive sex ed
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
would would go beyond
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
that if I may just have a brief followup
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for uh the the information
 
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
on the studies but but that none of that
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
t said exactly what is actually being
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
taught under the lgbtq rubric or what
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
taught there's a lot there but I would
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
say basically the concepts of acceptance
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
of all people for who they are is is one
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
um I I I I will submit my written
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
testimony it I submitted about seven or
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
eight quotes from the study which goes
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
into a little more detail but the point
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to make is there's more
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
to comprehensive sex ed than just
 
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:35.720 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted diseases and teen
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and a a comprehensive approach
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
would provide other benefits if we agree
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
that General sex head is effective in
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
reducing teen pregnancy then we know
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
that having an instructor talk to
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
Children is a good thing to happen and
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is that there are other
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
things Beyond simply those two things
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
that can also be beneficial from a
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
public health standpoint thank you are
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
there any more questions from the
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
banet thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
the committee Jil B I'm the legal
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
director at theu of New Hampshire we
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill uh I know I only have
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
two minutes um so I'll try to to keep it
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh brief um I have not seen the
 
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
amendment by the way I've only seen the
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
original the original version um uh I
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of one one kind of opening
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
headline is to the extent that this bill
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
is trying to kind of get at um obscenity
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh which seems like might be one of the
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
intentions at least based on the
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
definitions though I didn't hear
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
much of that during the sponsors
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I just did want to flag for
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
folks that we already have a harmful to
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
minor statute I know that's come up with
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
respect to other bills but I just wanted
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
to amplify and uplift that here for the
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee harmful to minor statutes
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
applies to to everyone individual
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
schools Etc so I do think in many
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
respects we already have Protections in
 
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
place with respect to um things that are
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
meet the standard for uh obscenity and I
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
also do want to flag out flag um that
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
school districts as required by a 2017
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
law um already have objectional
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
materials policies under RSA 186 colon
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
um 11 Roman numeral 9-c which require 14
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
days of notice for curriculum course
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
material used for instruction of human
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
sexuality or human sexual uh education
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
so we already have through this 2017 law
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
basically an opt out right when notice
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
is provided to to parents and they can
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
opt out um you know when they're given
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
notice within 14 days so I just wanted
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
to flag that and maybe that addresses
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns that have already
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
been raised I'm not sure but I do think
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
we already have um that that uh that
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
protection um in in place now what this
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
bill does is it goes a little bit
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
further right and it's essentially an
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
opin law under its Provisions but I just
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag that we already have some
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
existing laws on this um I just do want
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
to highlight two Provisions that I think
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
are particular a particular concern um
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
to us and there's one section of the
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
bill that states that human section ual
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
education shall be reserved solely for
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
specific human sexual education classes
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
it shall not be taught or included at
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
any way in any other academic subject
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
instruction or curriculum and I think I
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
would just identify that that is on uh
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
page three M numeral 7 and I and I think
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
there's some concerns with that right
 
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
human sexual education is not really
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
specifically defined at least from what
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
I can tell um in the bill uh and so I
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
think this this could really implicate
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
very broad things right um including the
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
definition of self- resect respect of
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
all other peoples which is one of the
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
definitions or one of the criteria or
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
components of of sexual education in the
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill so I think this restriction is
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
really impractical because material in
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
nonsexual education classes often
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
implicates right sexuality right you can
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
think about like reading Romeo and
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
Juliet right the content of that of
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
course gone by your two minutes okay
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
well I think that I just want to
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
highlight that I think that is very
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
impractical right because there are
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
other courses that obviously implicate
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
sexuality and I think this says that
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
that they can't do that and I think
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's just doesn't make a lot of sense
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
the last thing I just do want to say I
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
know and I I'm sorry that I'm going over
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
is the targeting of lgbtq folks here I
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
think is is a real thing and it is a
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
concern that we have in section six um
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill um and and really I think
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
it's it stigmatizes the community of
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
course one cannot engage in sexual
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
education instruction without
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
discussions I think of sexual
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
orientation sexual preferences these
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
things of course are going to come up in
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
conversations so excluding them I think
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
is both impractical and and um really
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the needs of of many of
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
those students so um with that I'll
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and I want to
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank the committee's time and for those
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
reasons we represent
 
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony I just wanted to
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
clarify one piece because you said that
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
there is uh already Protections in our
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
schools for children from being shown
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
obscene materials um in law but are you
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
aware that that law in New in New
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically exempts all
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
schools from uh from it being enforced
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not aware of that being the case
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
the now I think what you might be
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
referring to is the not the harmful to
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
minor statute I reference but the
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
criminal obscenity statute is that what
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
you're referring to representative
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes so um it is true that
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
that exempts uh schools it exempts K
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
through2 private schools as well right
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think that exemption
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
exist exists under the harmful to minor
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
statute which is why that is the statute
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
I referenced and not the criminal
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
obscenity statute thank you further
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
manzelli thank you good morning chairman
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
lad members of the committee my name is
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
Amy manzelli I'm here to testify on
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself and my husband as
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire and residents
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
of Pembrook we are opposed to HB 185 as
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
amended I have not read the amendment
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
but I've heard an overview of its
 
00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
intention and it does not fix the
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
problems with this
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill um I have some written testimony
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to skip over the um
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
personal story that I shared with you
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
about our transgender daughter Iris
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
who's 14 years old I'm going to go right
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
to um a different part of what we want
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
to share with you which is um how our
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
personal story fits into the context of
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
our shared American history and I want
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
to talk about three laws in
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
1967 the United States Supreme Court
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
ruled in loving be Virginia that
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
marriage is one of the basic civil
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
rights under our constitution the
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
freedom to marry a person of another
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
race resides with the individual
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
and the state cannot infringe on that
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
right and in that case MD and Richard
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
people of different races were able to
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
stay married and that was not a crime in
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
1971 the United States Supreme Court
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
ruled in re V read that to give a
 
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.790 align:start position:0%
ruled in re V read that to give a
mandatory

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory

arbitrary legislative Choice our
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%

estate and in
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
2015 the United States Supreme Court
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
ruled in oel V hajes that a person can
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
marry another person of whatever gender
 
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.190 align:start position:0%
marry another person of whatever gender
they

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
want the court said
 
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
changed understandings are
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
characteristic of a
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
Nation where New Dimensions of free
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
generations just like our daughter
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
Iris none of the plaintiffs in these
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
cases were
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous none of them deserved to be
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
written out of the
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
story indeed what they
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
wanted was only to live their lives with
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
the freedoms Americans en jooy under our
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
nation's great
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
laws in the United States minutes thank
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
you I'm wrapping up and the United
 
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court found the laws that
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
prevented them from doing so were on the
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
wrong side of American
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
History if passed this law would also be
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
on the wrong side of our American
 
00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
history it wrongfully targets the lgbtq
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
plus minority for no
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
reason other than citizens in the lgbtq
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
plus Community they might be different
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
from some prior understandings passing
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
laws like this would be an unfounded
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
seizure of civil rights that our proud
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
American history should protect for all
 
00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.789 align:start position:0%
American history should protect for all
Americans

00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:49.799 align:start position:0%
Americans
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
equally please itl
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
1185 as amended are there any thank you
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative Pell
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned marriage quite a
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
bit but I'm not sure where marriage is
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this bill and um I believe
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
your child transitioned at a very young
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
age and so my real question is how early
 
00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
do you think sex education should have
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
start should start in
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
schools um in public schools it should
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
start in
 
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
preschool further questions from the
 
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.230 align:start position:0%
preschool further questions from the
committee

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all like
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
bfield in the interest of time I'm going
 
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
to make this very quick and I'm just
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
going to skip questions I hope you don't
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
mind but I know that we're now over um
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
first of all Amry Banfield I'm a
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
parental rights advocate in New
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire focused on education I see
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
this bill as a transparency bill I think
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
that that's always
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
important I'll give you an example in
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
sixth grade I got a call from a
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
teacher and who was teaching my daughter
 
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
in sixth grade and said they're going to
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
be covering um reproduction in sixth
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
grade and to look at the science book
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
that she was using I went to it and it
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
was basic
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
biology something like that is so
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
important to parents and of course my
 
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
daughter learned the bi biological
 
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
information that was taught but her
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
reaching out to me and and this is what
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
I think people need to understand that
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
enforces that confirms that affirms my
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
daughter being in that school with that
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
teacher and I don't feel the need to
 
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
pull her out but when things are hidden
 
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's where it becomes a problem
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
another parent because I've been doing
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
this so long another parent um called me
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
years ago this has been years
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
ago she went to a presentation that the
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
school gave and everybody was there this
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
is what we're going over and then her
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
son came home fifth grade and burst into
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
tears because he thought he would be
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
wetting the
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
bed they thought he thought that from
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
the presentation and this is what the
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't explain to the parent at the at
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
the presentation but he was going to
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
start wetting the bed because of wet
 
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
dreams they weren't they didn't explain
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
it so he thought in fifth grade and had
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
he not come to his mother and told her
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
he would have had had that
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
information incorrect in his brain so
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
anytime we can be transparent I think
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.470 align:start position:0%
it's a
plus

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
plus
 
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
um that's it I'm not going to go any
 
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
further I think everything else has been
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
said so thank you very much uh Jennifer
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
Smith yes she said she was not gonna
 
00:52:47.319 --> 00:52:51.190 align:start position:0%
Smith yes she said she was not gonna
take

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions good morning chairman lad and
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
taking

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um I had signed in online
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to this and I kind of thought I
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
don't think I want to come um but and I
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
thought everybody else would say things
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
perfectly well without me but then I
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
thought about it some more and I thought
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
you know amending this bill into a study
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
committee would be a perfect opportunity
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
for people who have very different views
 
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
to talk to each other in detail which we
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
can't do this morning about why we
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
believe what we believe I think we all
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
want to protect our kids grandkids and
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
other people's kids and grandkids from
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary infections
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
unnecessary pregnancies that may be even
 
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
intended or unintended but a bad idea
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
with poor
 
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
understanding and also and I will say
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
this to protect our lgbtq students
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
because there are different es in
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
sexuality that need to be explored for
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
them as well and how do you do this and
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
I do believe abstinence belongs in the
 
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum absolutely but also some
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
modifications of that because people are
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
people and sexuality is a very appealing
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
thing starting very early in puberty so
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
I I think you know to try to go into
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
questions of what's sexuality for what
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
specific things are important for queer
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
kids to have in the curriculum doesn't
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
make sense here today to me I'll try to
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
answer a question if I get asked it oh I
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
forgot to say I'm a retired medical
 
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
physician I also have a public health
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
degree infectious diseases including all
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
the venial diseases are an area of great
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
interest and always have been we are
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
currently in a problem with Rising rates
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
of that are very
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
worrisome and so you know we need to
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
think about does this help does this
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
hinder the overall situation not just
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
for your individual family or someone
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
else's individual family who it's been
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
noted can opt out do their own sex
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
education if they don't like this but we
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
need to think what makes sense for
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
people in general in most of our schools
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
our public
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
schools and I would submit that that

will not be something you can easily
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
tease out today or in your consideration
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill later and maybe turning
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
this into study committee would be an
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to stop talking
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
good morning Nancy Beerman um I'm here
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
in support of 11 185 House Bill
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
1185 I'm here because um at this point
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
the trust between parents and schools
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
has deteriorated parents are questioning
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
their trust of what is being said in the
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
classroom they're being questioning what
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
is being taught and they don't trust
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
what teachers are saying and doing in
 
00:56:42.079 --> 00:56:43.230 align:start position:0%
what teachers are saying and doing in
the

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:46.039 align:start position:0%
classroom this bill puts up the guard
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
rails and yes it does tie the teachers
 
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
hands as they should be there are rules
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
and there's areas that teachers should
 
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:57.559 align:start position:0%
not not step over the line and teachers
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
are stepping over that line more and
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
more every
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
day I was a teacher for 15 years and I
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
knew where the line was there were
 
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
topics that I did not discuss the
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
students may ask the question and I
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
would say you know that's a mommy and
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
daddy question and then I would let the
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
mom and dad know that your child had
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
this question at school today just
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
because the child ask the question does
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
not mean the teacher needs to answer
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
it as far as repealing
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%

the school district says no we can still
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
keep and it doesn't matter if I think

01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill we have over 40
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
cards which we've received so I am going
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
to limit the time to 2 minutes at the
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
end of 2 minutes I'm going to turn your
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
mic off so you know just be aware 2
 
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
minutes is what we're allowing for
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
people to speak on also as done in other
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
committees if we hear the same
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
duplication over and over and over it's
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
already been communicated you can say I
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
Echo those previous cards that spoke out
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
and said this you don't have to go in
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
and repeat everything that's been
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
previously said so we're not trying to
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
eliminate your you know expressing your
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
opinions but if your opinion parallels
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
something that's previously been said
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
please identify that and let us know
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
that so we can get everybody heard today
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's our primary goal right here on
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
this committee so with that the way we
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
work is that the the prime sponsor is
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
entitled to speak more but I'm going to
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
limitate limit this to no more than 10
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
minutes we've gone much further than
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
that on some other bills uh where we're
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
going to do the uh limiting right here
 
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
um so welcome uh representative
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
sellers uh good morning and thank you uh
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and vice chair Celli and
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
also the education committee thank you
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to hear what I have
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
to say I'm representative of sellers
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
Grafton County district 18 I represent
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
the towns of Bristol Alexandria
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Heen
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
Gren Dorchester orange Grafton Kanan and
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
Enfield even I have to think and
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
remember these because these are the 10
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
southern towns of Grafton County
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
approximately 177,000 residents and I'm
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
actually bringing this bill not for
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
myself but I as a resident or a voter it
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
is for myself but many of my
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
constituents have actually said please
 
01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
do something with this all right and
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear a lot of testimony
 
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
and a lot of hot testimony where seal is
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually very helpful and useful in the
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
schools and I'm not doubting it isn't
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
but what I am going to be showing and
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
bringing forward is some information
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's saying I'm not sure a lot of the
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
folks in any of the districts uh uh of
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
our schools understand and know what
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
seal is and so therefore again seal uh
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
in is stands for social emotional
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
learning all right now you you you just
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
start with that alone and say what is
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
that you know what I don't even think
 
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
the school districts can Define it
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure they know how to
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
opt in or opt out of it and just to
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
state that alone and before I go any
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
further I did offer an amendment which
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
44738 and the amendment is an OP out
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
situation instead of the actual bill
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
which is to cease use and not provide
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
any funds forcl at all so technically
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
the education committee can actually
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
have a choice and uh which which they
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
would like to choose either allow the
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
parents to opt out okay or they could
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
just cease using seal in our state Al
 
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
together now instead of me just trying
 
01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
to um say everything duplicate that's
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
been said probably for years at this
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
point I just want to say as I started
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
diving into this probably a little over
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
six months ago and shame on me for not
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
knowing it before and then but uh I just
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
didn't um in that time one I got a list
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
of acronyms I'm telling I think the
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
school uh the districts actually have
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
more acronyms than the uh US US military
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
so and I had to make a list because I
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
was getting so confused of how many
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
acronyms there are out there all right
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I want to bring up
 
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
real quick is this is the test schooles
 
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
for Newfound for 2023 which is last year
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
is okay um and everybody thinks that
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
they're doing great and this is just one
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
District okay and we're just slightly
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
above the state average and when you
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
really get down to it they're only at 60
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
65% depending on what you which one
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
you're looking at EA
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
65% math it's uh uh 51% in uh science
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
there again it's at 40% and and going
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
back there because that means the other
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
half of what's failing so these are our
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
academics and they're thinking we're
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
doing wonderful in academics we're not
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're not doing wonderful and we're just
 
01:12:49.709 --> 01:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
slightly above the state average so I
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point that out so in
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
front of you I actually gave a handout
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
here it says uh The Unexplained rise of
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic education how uh social
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
emotional learning extends K through 12
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
education reach into students lives and
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
expands teachers roles all right I say
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
to that to you just on the front page
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
because one it has four key points and
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read them because again
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to save some time I God this
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
thing would take hours to try to talk to
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
and figure out it's irritating to me
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
and you know how much time and trying to
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
figure this out but it does have
 
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
tentacles into everything it does touch
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
everything seal touches our lives every
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
single day so when they say at the
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
school well it's in everything you know
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
what yeah it is in everything but we
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
need to Define it we need to figure this
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
out because it's not right for our kids
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
so I passed this out to you so you can
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
see those fo points but here I just want
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
to I I want to read a couple things here
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
off to you which is again
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to recreate the wheel
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
all over again I'm just going to read
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
some this person puts it just right the
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
Bland uh pseudo science in somewhat incr
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
inscrutable term social and emotional
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
learning grafted onto the academic
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
effort of schooling mask its nature all
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
right think about that for a minute
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
they're saying it's all about academics
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
but it's all about social emotional
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
learning and now I'm going to put the
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
key on social emotional learning is
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
mental health and that's what they're
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do now with the schools is
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
provide mental health not for the 16%
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
that need it but for the 100% of the
 
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
kids in our schools and the 16% I'm
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
citing is from Nami
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
nmi National Alliance for mental illness
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
they stated
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
16% actually have mental illnesses each
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
year or a year for the kids so this is
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
coming from them all right right and and
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be come across as UNP
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh compassionate I'm very compassionate
 
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about these kids and
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
out their education all right and so
 
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
therefore I may sound like I'm heartless
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm not I'm very very very concerned
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh another quote here from this uh this
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
article and that's why I gave you the
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
top sheet of that you can easily just
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh part of that the uh title
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
into the web and you can easily get the
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
article yourself it's about 12 pages and
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh there's many many more articles you
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
can find but here's another one he says
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh this person he says there is an
 
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
obvious risk of viewing entire
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
classrooms as stalked with children
 
01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
classrooms as stalked with children
traumz

01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
traumz
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
traumatized by definition all right St
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
with children traumatized by definition
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
all right because we just went through
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
covid so you know when you have 100%
 
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
technically going and having mental
 
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
illnesses I mean now they got to try to
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
weed this out all right and to try to
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
weed that out they actually use the uh
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
another framework which they call
 
01:16:09.159 --> 01:16:16.229 align:start position:0%
another framework which they call
mts-based

01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
the doe you can get it there as far as
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh total information but what that does
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
is provide a framework work again with
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
three levels or three tiers of mental
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
health so they're trying to group the
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
kids into three levels you're okay yeah
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
you might need some help you definitely
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
need some help okay now they're getting
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
there because they're collecting data on
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
the kids all right they you can't figure
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
this out unless you collect data and how
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
you collect data is you do you do U uh
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
surveys and assessments all right and
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
now on those surveys and assessments are
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
some very private information that goes
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
back into the family goes right back
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
into your household all right so those
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
things even though they are getting
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
consent they are now collected the data
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
it's in the data system of the school
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
all right at that point but they're also
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
using Keen state they're passing some of
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
that if not all of that data to Keen
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
State because Keen state is looking at
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
the data as a whole and trying to say
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
hey this District this District needs
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
this this one has that and so on they
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
might not be given the actual CH child's
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
name but they're still passing the data
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
all right at that point
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
um so the data is a big thing it it's
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
you know how you he cash is King data is
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
King all right data is King this day and
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
age so I just here's here's one part I'm
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to read and then it's I'm going to
 
01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
wrap it up all right um and these are
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
questions these are the questions
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman asks it says
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
by what right does the government
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
establish uh a um I'm going to need to
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
get my glasses on this sorry about
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
that I thought I could read it without
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
the glasses
 
01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.750 align:start position:0%
the glasses
but

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.350 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay says but what right does the
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
government established approved mindsets
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
to be in calculated in children next
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
question by what right does it deputize
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
minimally trained Personnel I mean it
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
minimally minimally trained Personnel
 
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
they're not psychologist they're
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
minimally trained Personnel they are not
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
psychologist to measure children's
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
adoption to these mindsets and
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
memorialize their process progress in
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
the uh internally Loosely data system
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
but what right does it employs such
 
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
immature mental assessments to set
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
children on the road to
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
overdiagnose overdiagnose think about
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
that this could actually lead to
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
medicines as well over diagnose and
 
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.669 align:start position:0%
medicines as well over diagnose and
perhaps

01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
overmedication with potentially harm
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
harmful uh psychotropic drugs but what
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
right does the government wield these
 
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
techniques not to generally educate
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
children to fulfill their dreams but to
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
mold them it's the child's psyche their
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
changeing the mind we just heard some
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
the indoctrination
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
a teacher teaches it's a teaching it's a
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
tool it's indoctrination all right so
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
these are techniques to generally
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
educate children to fulfill their dreams
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
but to mold them into the kind of human
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
beings it deems more useful for the you
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
are done your time all right and the
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
last question all right and uh useful
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce and service to the state and
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
by what right does it have any of these
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh without notifying or potentially
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
notifying or uh obtaining cons uh
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
consent and so on so any I'll leave it
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
there like I said this could go on for
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
hours and I apologize for even run over
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
in 10 minutes boy 10 minutes goes fast
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
this whole issue of social emotional
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
learning is kind of hard I think for a
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people to wrap their heads around
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
because it's a methodology that seems to
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
infiltrate a lot of different things can
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
you give one clear example of um how a
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
teacher just from your experience what
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard an example of how a teacher
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
in a classroom would Implement some um
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
sure social emotional learning and how
 
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
that would reflect what uh is what you
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
consider wrong with it okay so let's
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
let's take for an example a math
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
question all right um here's the
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
question Johnny's mom and dad are
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
bringing Johnny to a fair which is 50
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
mil away they have a travel 20 miles how
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
many miles left all right simple it's a
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
math question for for I don't know
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
second third grade whatever it would be
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
right what they do is the teacher not in
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
all cases but in some and it depends on
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
the teacher all right instead of getting
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
into the math question they'll get into
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
the well Johnny has Mom and Dad how do
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
you all feel about that do you all have
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
mom and dads they're asking the kids
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
question so getting the kids involved
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
this way all right and then they say do
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
you think it's right to have two moms or
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
two dads or you know Mom and Dad or
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
whatever right so they're talking about
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
that and then the next thing they're
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
talking about is saying well how many
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
year you went to the faar you know and
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
then the next thing they go said well
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
why didn't you go and some say well I
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it and they said well
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
you think that's right and and then so
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
they're getting into all that psych
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
stuff and getting the uh the kids
 
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
technically I'd say worked up because
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
you could say no well I'm sorry you
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it so now they're
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
getting in to equality saying well you
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
should have been able to go so everybody
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
should be able to go so that's one
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
example and that's probably a decent one
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
I can are there further questions from
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Miler thank
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative sellers for being here
 
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.709 align:start position:0%
representative sellers for being here
I'm

01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:01.719 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:22:01.719 --> 01:22:03.510 align:start position:0%
I'm
confused

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
confused
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
um your your comments were basically
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
focused on your original
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
Bill I'd like to have you focus on your
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
replacement bill and if I read your
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
replacement bill your amendment is
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
primarily focused on Gathering of data
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
not on the teaching of seal is that
 
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
correct so it um we the commissioner
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
thought when I was speaking with the
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner thought that this would be
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
the best place to put that in and so it
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
would be for the opt out part but also
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom of the bill he also
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
suggested this is the identification or
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
definition of it which is the definition
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's used in Castle
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
cael which is almost a mantra that every
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
school district's using and by the way
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
we're only 37 school districts in our
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
state is using this right now only 37
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
out of I think what
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
182 but if I to
 
01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:05.639 align:start position:0%
clarify the amendment deals with the
 
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
Gathering of information not the
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
teaching of seel
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
correct that's your intent that is where
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
it is in here you're right and and what
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
they're doing in the teaching because
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
every teacher is and I said let's put
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
back every staff member our staff
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
members eventually if they're not doing
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
it yet they're going to be is providing
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
input to
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
the call it the scoring system which
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
will actually create a level one two a
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
three tier so it is dater at that point
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
it all comes it all comes back to
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
data further questions I'm sorry it's it
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
is a lot there and I I'm not trying to
 
01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
confuse representative cordelli uh thank
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
you representative sellers um uh in your
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
introduction you said that seal touches
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
everything and you brought up even a
 
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
math example um but in the
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
amendment um you're talking about the
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
provision of social emotional
 
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.590 align:start position:0%
provision of social emotional
learning

01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
learning
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and that no student should be
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
required to uh take a survey or
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
questionnaire or the provision of social
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
emotional learning so are you talking
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
about saying that that social emotional
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
learning cannot be um taught as in your
 
01:24:34.239 --> 01:24:35.550 align:start position:0%
learning cannot be um taught as in your
original

01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
Bill isn't that what you're indicating
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
in the amendment as well and if and if
 
01:24:44.669 --> 01:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
you are saying that it touches
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
everything and that there has to be
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
noticed in advance to the parent when
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be provided I don't see
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
how how do you provide notice um of
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
someone introducing something that you
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
define as social emotional learning in a
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
math class I'm not sure how that all
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
works okay so first of all the yes words
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely matter provision would I need
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
to go back and look up the word and the
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
definition of it because that's what I
 
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
like to do with this that's what I've
 
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
learned as being a legislator look up
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
every word and what it
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
means but at this point here the the
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.790 align:start position:0%
means but at this point here the the
uh

01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:24.189 --> 01:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
it's simple enough ask the school what
 
01:25:26.669 --> 01:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
it means you know why why can't the
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
school identify this I mean I'm saying
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's in everything they should be able
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
it further
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
questions represent Damon thank you Mr
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for take my
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
question so if seal is in everything as
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
times I guess I need some clarity on
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
how are our wonderful trained
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
professional Educators would remove it
 
01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
professional Educators would remove it
from

01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
everything and still teach
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
children so the the example I gave you
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
on the math problem they don't have to
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
do that they can just teach the math go
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
back into the academics itself and and
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
spend more time in the academic part of
 
01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
it instead of actually the story part of
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
it and that's that's one part they can
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
right very quickly please
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
so in the original
 
01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
Bill your uh definition of social
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
emotional learning lines 5 through
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
12 you I just want to hear confirmation
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
that I'm understand this
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
correctly you would
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
oppose a staff person in a
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
school providing encouragement
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
motivation suggesting to a student that
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
they have enough grit to persevere with
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
something that's hard for them to do so
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
again um I'm not looking for the common
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
sense to be ripped out I mean that truly
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
is common sense at that point but the
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
lines 5 through 12 like you're saying uh
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
self-awareness self-management social
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
awareness relationship skills in
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
relation responsible decision- making
 
01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
that comes from the castle website all
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
right this is their Mantra that they're
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
following and this is part of the stuff
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
that we're saying does not need to be
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
taught are there further questions
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
represent beler thank you Mr chair and
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this forward um I
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people were surprised
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned um this idea that a
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
teacher might go kind of off topic in a
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
math equation to talk about other things
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
social things things and I my question
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
for you is are you aware that that the
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
official name for that such a thing is
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
called generative themes that is part of
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
fre and pedagogy that is taught at most
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh universities and colleges of
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
country well no no I'm not aware of that
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
I can't say I am and and I'll have to
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
admit I I I'm just Joe the plumber I'm
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
not the uh PhD doctorate on in education
 
01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you further questions from the
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee represent McDonald thank you
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair good morning
 
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative I'm looking specifically
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
at the amendment online 23 where social
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
emotional learning includes
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
self-awareness self-management and I
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
understand you said you got that
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
definition from somewhere else but I'm
 
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
thinking of the word social and kind of
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
a student interacting with other
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
students so these self-reflective
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
Concepts does that include things such
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
as time management such as you have a
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
homework assignment due let's try to
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
figure out how to time manage and get
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
this homework assignment done is that
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
included in social emotional learning
 
01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
are you saying time management you
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
saying like that again that would be
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
just common sense you would why why are
 
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
we throwing Common Sense out the window
 
01:28:55.709 --> 01:28:55.719 align:start position:0%
that that's not that's not necessary
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I believe in
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony you said that social
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
emotional learning has tentacles
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere and I'm curious how a parent
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
would possibly be able to opt out if
 
01:29:10.639 --> 01:29:11.629 align:start position:0%
would possibly be able to opt out if
it's

01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere that's where the school
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
district or the Department of Education
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
someone needs to identify this we're
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
trying to identify it in in in the
 
01:29:23.709 --> 01:29:23.719 align:start position:0%
original um bill lines 5 through 12 at
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
that point but you know the the general
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
def uh definition of
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah the definition is is the selfa
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
witness self-manager you know social
 
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
wellness and again you have to go back
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
to the castle website which actually
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
says this is what each one means so I
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
guess if you can say okay if we can box
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
that in then you can have an opt out
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
situation at that point all right I can
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
only tell you I was at my uh delivered a
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
session this last Saturday and we were
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
talking about seal because it was part
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the budget and everything else at
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
this point and and many people didn't
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
even know what SEO was and or the
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
acronym at all and so on so I mean this
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
is like how the anybody knows about this
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
and it's yet it's it digs deep and it's
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
in going into the into the psyche of the
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
child and it is teaching the child
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
certain aspects beyond what the family
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
should be teaching the child and I think
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
it's usurping the family but hopefully I
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
answer that as far as definition it
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
really comes up to maybe someone someone
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
coming out and forcing this
 
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
definition representative cascaden thank
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%

representative for your presentation uh
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
my question is the story that you relate
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
or the example you relate did you
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
yourself observe that in a classroom or
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
did you use that story to um explain
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
your point uh no I try to observe
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
anything in the classroom this day you
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
can't get in the door um you know even
 
01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
though it's public we call it a public
 
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
school you can't you get in there this
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
came from a video I actually watched as
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
an example how they're using it someone
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
must have at one time have seen this and
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of some of the stuff I related to
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
and talked about is from a a video here
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
a video there and even going back and
 
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
just going on one other thing is even
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
the department new uh New Hampshire
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
had a video on consent they were talking
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
about to counselors and uh in Keen State
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
and even they couldn't figure out should
 
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
we uh should we call the parents or
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
should we uh text the parents a or email
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
the parents a consent form in this case
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
in that case they're confused they don't

done uh so Mr chair thank you I need I
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
need a clarification from the chair we
 
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
have two issues before us we have the
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
original 1473 as introduced now we have
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
before the committee the
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
amendment which is different than the
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
original and the question to you Mr
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
chair is our Focus as a committee on the
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
amendment or the original Bill the
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
amendment can't be taken up by the
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee until a member on the
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
committee in an executive session put
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
that Amendment forward so we're
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
basically still on the bill as it was
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
introduced although you bring up a good
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
point that I'm going to have copies of
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment made uh if Jennifer for
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
is listening to me somewhere I don't see
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
her in the back of the room she's in the
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
room she's in the other room if she
 
01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
could come and we'll give this amendment
 
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
to her um in testimony uh represent
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
seller you say
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
7473 it's 7437 is that
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
correct okay so we'll get copies of this
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
amendment made and put forward on on the
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
table over they're placed on a table so
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
folks that are looking to get it or
 
01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
0437 h of course it starts out with
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
2024 do you have a clean copy I'll go
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
give it to Jennifer yeah back to
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
Jennifer so with that we're going to go
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
ahead and I'm going to call two
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
names the in case that the one of these
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
people may be in the other room so so
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's just like baseball who's up and
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
who's on Deck who's in the hole so so
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
Mary steady you're up and Lenny O'Keefe
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
Deck two minutes and and we have
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely two minutes for cutting off
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
in two
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.229 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the House Education
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for listening to me
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
today my name is Dr Mary steady and I've
 
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
spent 30 years supporting students from
 
01:34:33.149 --> 01:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable backgrounds in their families
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
after the heartbreaking Sandy Hook event
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
I worked tily in New Hampshire to set up
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
ways to keep our students and their
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
families safe from such tragedies by the
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
development and the creation of the
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
Bureau of student wellness and nutrition
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Education this
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
bill I'm afraid is a big step back from
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
all the work as it fundamentally
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
undermines the substantial progress we
 
01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
have made in fostering student wellness
 
01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
and creating nurturing educational
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
environments today I am before you to
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
share my strong opposition of proposed
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
1473 which seeks to prohibit us from
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
teaching our kids how to be strong and
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
good people ready to do great things for
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
our community in trying to understand
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
the underlying message of this bill it
 
01:35:20.669 --> 01:35:20.679 align:start position:0%
became increasingly clear to me that
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
this legisl in question is not just
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
impractical illogical but indeed B
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
borders on the
 
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
ludicrous this brings me to the real
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
elephant in the Rome this bill seems
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
less about supporting and nurturing our
 
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
children and more about the profound and
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
troubling Trend the active dismantling
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
of public education system we need to
 
01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
ask our legislators is this legislators
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
is this bill really just another attempt
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
to gut part of the educational system so
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
will cease to exist getting rid of
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't just tweak a few things it
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
actively interferes with RSA 93 J
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention and RSA 193f pupil
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
safety these laws make sure our schools
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
are places where kids can feel safe and
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about getting hurt
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
or bullied seal teaches kids how to
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
handle their feelings sort out problems
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
be kind and wel welcoming to everyone
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
moreover this bill proposes a direct
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
challenge to the objectives in RSA
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
1359 system of care law which
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
prioritizes early identification and
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
intervention in addressing student
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
mental health issues a vital
 
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort between the New
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education and
 
01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Health

we do is we we visit kids in school and
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
and take take help with activities in
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%

01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
ago I was in school and a principal was
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
explaining uh choose love and that's the
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
only Seal program that I know about is
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
the Choose Love movement uh to his
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
parents of what Choose Love was and
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
after listening to him for about 10
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
minutes I called the Choose Love love
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
number and hooked up with choose love
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I was able to uh the next day meet
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
with Scarlett Lewis who is the mother
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
from Sandy Hook who created the Choose
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
Love movement after that I got to Tour
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire um for a
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
whole year with Scarlet Liberty myself
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
with scarlet and we did Choose Love
 
01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
activities at these schools um just want
 
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
to tell you one quick story about one of
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
the schools we visited so um in
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
Charlotte in Charlotte's program she
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
talks about forgiveness and children
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
learn about forgiveness and this is
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
coming from mother who lost her son in a
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
school shooting and she talks about how
 
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
forgiveness has helped her because she
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
was able to cut the cord from herself to
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
the school shooter and it eased her
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
anxiety um it freed her from the school
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
shooter so we're talking about
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
forgiveness at a school um in Southern
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and a third grader had
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
written down what we called was a
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
forgiveness basketball they write down
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
something they want to forgive and they
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
throw it in a b garbage can so that's
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
they're cutting the cord they're
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
forgiving they're it's no longer on
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
their mind they're able to move on so
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
one of the teachers picked the piece of
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
paper up because the little boy was
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
really really you could tell the little
 
01:38:58.510 --> 01:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
boy was excited and he was relieved so
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
after the little boy walked away we read
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
the paper the paper said I forgive my
 
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
dad for being mad at me last night
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
because I didn't play well in the hockey
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
game so if you want to talk about
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
academics that day if that little boy
 
01:39:12.189 --> 01:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
didn't forgive his dad that little boy
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
is not learning anything that day you
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
know he was able to take that
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
forgiveness and throw it away and then
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
he went on with his day but before that
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
that's what was on his mind was that he
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
didn't play well in a hockey game last
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
night so I have never heard that
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
question asked I visited a hundred
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%

to come and speak here today um I'm the
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
principal and special education director
 
01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
at Spalding Academy and family services
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
and I've worked there for the last 24
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
years and we serve the most difficult
 
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
children in the state the children that
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
can't have their needs met in a public
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
school setting these are the kids that
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
cost districts $100,000 a year to
 
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
educate they send them to us cuz they're
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
simply not successful and they're not
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
safe in a public school setting these
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
are the kids that come to school and
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
they cry in the counselor's offices they
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
don't feel safe they're bullied it's our
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
job to meet their emotional needs they
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
don't all have parents at home that are
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
positive mail or role models to help
 
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
them process the complexity of the
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
feelings that they have right now we
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
introduced social motion learning in uh
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
202 22 and since we did that our all of
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
our students are tier three students
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
when you refer to
 
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
mtss um we've had students that have
 
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
decreased their behavioral referrals
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
from 18 a month to one from 13 a month
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
to one we've had children that refus to
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
go to school who attended School 56% of
 
01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:14.679 align:start position:0%
the time 47% of the time 0% and 0% of
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
the time prior to their placement these
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
same children now come to school 90%
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
100% 9 9% and 100% of the time it's
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
because we make a cognizant effort to
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
address their social and emotional needs
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
we make them feel safe because they're
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
attending school and their behavioral
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
referrals are down their academics are
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
going through the roof prior to social
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
emotional learning in a districtwide
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
assessment of neoa 46% of them met
 
01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
projected growth after a year that was
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
up to 62% and our brilliant resilient
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
children jumped that to 72% this winter
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a 26% increase by taking away
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
some academic time in the morning and
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
meeting their needs socially and
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
emotionally they walk through their
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
front door this was important enough
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
that Governor sonunu established a a
 
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
position and Shannon's run that for the
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
last couple years meeting the diverse
 
01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
needs of our children our our adults
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um I think we're
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
doing a great dishonor by even

now and uh seal is a focus on
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
self-awareness self-management

Choose Love curriculum which um Scarlet
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%

Massacre and um so that focuses on
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
teaching our children to have courage to
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
show gratitude to show forgiveness and
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
to show compassion and action and we
 
01:44:47.709 --> 01:44:47.719 align:start position:0%
spend about 45 minutes to an hour every
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
morning before the kids start their
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
academic day EXP licitly teaching these
 
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
skills just like we would teach children
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
read what what grade what grade what
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
grade level are you dealing with we
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%

for everything my question is you're the
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
second speaker speaker to have mentioned
 
01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
the Choose Love program are you aware of
 
01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
any other programs that are included
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
under seal um I I'm not aware of any
 
01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
other curriculum Castle also has
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
curricular materials we've really
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
partnered with um Shannon from the state
 
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and Scarlet to bring
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
choose love to to our school thank you
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further questions thank
 
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
Deck good morning my name is uh Tom
 
01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:51.639 align:start position:0%
Benjamin and I work with it over at
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
Spalding and in my two minutes I guess I
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
just want to share going back to the
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
original bill whyel is so important in
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion is that that bill even exists
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
and what I've learned throughout the
 
01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
years we're going to educate the kids we
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
either do it directly or they're going
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
to get their own education so what we're
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
trying to do and what the research has
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
said is that without explicit
 
01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
instruction means direct instruction
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
just like math they're not going to get
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
the social tional skills that we want
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
them to have this is a religious a
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
political um the example that was given
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
this morning yeah maybe that was
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
observed but that's not something we
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
would do at our school saying oh that's
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
too bad in the middle of your friends
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
you don't have a family that you know
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
that just absolutely would never occur
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
now my big thing I don't know this
 
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
except for speculation we have some of
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
the toughest kids in the state all right
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
we work with the toughest kids in the
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
state and I have a strong belief we can
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
reset their trajectory so one of my my
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
loved ones doesn't get hurt by them
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
Andor we can keep them out of prison at
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
$56,000 a year in the state of New
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean you're going to be
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
paying for it one way or
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
another um and then what's my
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
little and then I guess the last thing
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
which kind of goes along with this
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
Harvard has been doing a study that
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
lasts approximately 75 years it's the
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
longest longitudal study in the country
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
and it's on uh happiness and the number
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
one thing that they discovered and have
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
repeatedly discovered with happiness is
 
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
relationships those people who have
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
evaluated themselves to say I have a
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
strong relationship so the same people
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
who record themselves as having the
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
highest degree of Happiness we work with
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
kids from very very very difficult
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
places who have been to Hell him back
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
not through their own choice and we let
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
them know that they're loved every day
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
how could we not I mean you know cuz I
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
keep saying oh let forgive my dad well
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
we've got kids who would said because
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
but the dad you know beat me up last
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
night those are the kids that we work
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
with I'm talking about a second
 
01:47:57.149 --> 01:47:57.159 align:start position:0%
grader thank you very much are there
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
questions of Mr
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
benman yes represent dry thank you Mr
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here um so
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
i' I've heard today that this is
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
incorporated kind of into everything in
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
schools and yet you have a specific time
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
set a aside to do it during the day is
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
that where you teach a specific
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
curriculum and then use it during the
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
rest of the day right there are multiple
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum somebody ask there's like
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
second step um skill stream so there's
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
different social we use Choose Love and
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
so there are units so yeah we teach the
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
units so like today was on forgiveness
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
and then the kids and and I guess the
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
other thing I just stressed we have the
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
staff practices too because maybe some
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
of our staff are coming from difficult
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
places so we're all in it together um
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
and so there's a specific lesson that's
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
done for the week and then we carry it
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
through throughout the school day um
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
like I learned a lot about courage you
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
know courage it takes courage to forgive
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
somebody this is the lesson this morning
 
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
it takes courage to forgive somebody who
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't said they're
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you very much further
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for doing
 
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
what are you for represent
 
01:49:16.589 --> 01:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
leus in Choose Love do you have to um
 
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
take surveys of your kids analyze your
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
kids collect data that kind of stuff in
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
program do you have to I mean is that
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
part of the program yes well we have to
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
collect data because of the regulations
 
01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
that we have to operate under so like
 
01:49:32.589 --> 01:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
Garrett was talking about our incident
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
reports are really behavioral referrals
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
so we use that as our Benchmark are we
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
headed in the right direction if we're
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
not we change what we're doing but as
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
far as the particular program that's not
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
part of the program that of I don't know
 
01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:48.760 align:start position:0%

Amry thank you for that clarification
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
andry B fail parental rights advocate in
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I do support the
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
amendment not the original bill I do I
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
want to make that very clear uh I think
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
that the the amendment is just directed
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
at parental consent which is something
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
that every seal person in this room and
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
in our school should be doing already um
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
by law by federal law that's
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
required um some of the problems that
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
and and I'm going to turn written
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
testimony I hope that you'll go through
 
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
it because I'm going to have to shorten
 
01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:50.709 align:start position:0%
it because I'm going to have to shorten
it

01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
um some of the problems is is that uh it
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
creates standards and attitudes and
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
values and beliefs and dispositions this
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
is what the state would have to do
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
teachers have always supported children
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
social emotionally and I think that
 
01:51:06.589 --> 01:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
we're trying to look at what they've
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
always done and what seal has done is
 
01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:10.310 align:start position:0%
always done and what seal has done is
it's

01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
standardized it is now um also a data
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
collector it assess
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
children but that you know in the past
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
teachers have always tried to do this in
 
01:51:22.830 --> 01:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
the class room um it scores at child's
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
attitudes values beliefs and
 
01:51:26.189 --> 01:51:26.199 align:start position:0%
dispositions in a subjective way that's
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
why I received a call from a teacher in
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who is having to grade her
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
children uh her students um attitudes
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
and values and the problem with that was
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
that she had kids in the in the public
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
school and she was concerned about their
 
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
her kids' teachers also grading their
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
values and
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
attitudes uh it it appears to be that um
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
who received use the personal data once
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
once this information is
 
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
collected uh just 1473 as amended would
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
just affirm the ethical treatment of
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
children when they are assessed or
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
receiving Mental Health
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
Services um in Essa under uh I I think
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at this it it gives you a
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
link in Essa it does require parental
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
consent when servicing or assessing a
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
student's mental health so this is
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
something that they should already be
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
doing but I can tell you that they're
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
not because I've done rights and no
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
requests looking for parental consent
 
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
forms on some of these assessments and
 
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
they've provided no um consent form so
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
obviously they're not doing that we're
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
at the end of the two minutes okay all
 
01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
right I've got quite a bit more but uh
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
are there questions for emry if you have
 
01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
written testimony please submit that and
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
we'll be put up as part of the record
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
not see any questions thank you very
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
much I'd like to invite Nicholas Duffy
 
01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
today my name is Nick Duffy I am the
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
director of rehabilitative services for
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:53:16.270 --> 01:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
Correction part of my role is also
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
overseeing the correction Special School
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
District for the New Hampshire
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
Department of directions and um that's
 
01:53:25.149 --> 01:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
how uh we're attached to this bill is um
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
is with we're School District so social
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
emotional learning is something that we
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
also teach within our schools we
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
partnered with um Shannon scarlet and
 
01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
choose love um to develop a program for
 
01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
Corrections however this is also in our
 
01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
other programs um there's thinking for a
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
change there's more recognation therapy
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
and and others that um that we also do
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
um that teaches social emotional
 
01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
learning skills
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
um and so an example some of the topics
 
01:53:54.189 --> 01:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
that are learned in our programs and
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
courses include active compassionate
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
listening growth mindset how to deal
 
01:54:00.589 --> 01:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
with stress how to appropriately
 
01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:02.679 align:start position:0%
disagree forgiveness gratitude
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
self-awareness re resiliency healthy
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
assertiveness um and how to have
 
01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
difficult conversations to name a few
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
these are all skills that not only are
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
going to help individuals with
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
relationships but these are job skills
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
we need these they need these skills in
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
order to to get employment and
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
effectively keep employment um so
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
removing this would have a impact on
 
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
releasing individuals get them getting
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
jobs and having relationship with their
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
families um really their overall uh
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
well-being um we want people to leave
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration and not come back and um
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
we believe this would be a big step
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
backwards if we were to have to take
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
this out of our curriculums in education
 
01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh
 
01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
questions rep and dry thank you Mr
 
01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming yes um um
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
if we did the amendment when it was just
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
an opt out because of parental consent
 
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
would that affect what you are doing
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so I haven't looked at the
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
amendment um obviously I just heard
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
about it today but um I'm so not 100%
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
sure but it sounds like that it might
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
not affect us as much but I think a lot
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
of us have not seen that Amendment and
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
read it yeah represent
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
for your testimony in your work with
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
what you do um And in regards to the
 
01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
Choose Love movement in Seal is there a
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh restorative justice model or
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
framework being utilized in any of this
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think restorative justice is a
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
um is a big component of how we can um
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
work with victims with um with uh
 
01:55:37.629 --> 01:55:37.639 align:start position:0%
restoring people back to their
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
communities and I think that um I'm not
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
sure I I would need to talk a little bit
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
more with you about exactly what you
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
mean by that but I think yes restorative
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
justice is something we want in in most
 
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
of our programs thank you thank you for
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%

throughout New Hampshire we're here
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to this bill um we
 
01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
we feel that this would hinder uh the
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced would hinder our
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
ability to provide the life-saving
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um inter uh life-saving
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
um program that we um assist schools in
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
um providing to students um we also have
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
questions as someone else mentioned
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
about the suicide prevention law that we
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
worked hard to to get into place as you
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
may may know or remember um and so uh
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
that law does require the 193 J2 does
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
require that Suicide Prevention
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
education happen um for staff and
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
students annually in schools we know
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
that the the bill as introduced is in
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
direct conflict with um the student
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
portion of RSA um 193 J2 and we have
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
questions about whether or not that
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
would affect the staff portion of that
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill of that law or not there was some
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
um language about professional
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
development so we're just not sure about
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
and so um there's and you know the
 
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
program that we um assist schools with
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
um providing for their students is
 
01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:10.679 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um students that um
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
engage in that program are 64 process uh
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
perc less likely to report that they
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
have attempted an attempted suicide so
 
01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
we do believe that with without um
 
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
without this life-saving um program or
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
other Pro other evidence-based programs
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
like it um we will see an increase in
 
01:58:30.189 --> 01:58:30.199 align:start position:0%
suicide death youth in New Hampshire and
 
01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
it already is the second leading cause
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
of death so um other than that I can
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um I can answer any
 
01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:40.520 align:start position:0%

01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative dry thank you
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
and thank you for for coming to testify
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the same question I
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
just asked if if if we did the amendment
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
which just is an opt out program how
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
would that affect you so I actually I'm
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
not able to answer that question fully
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
because I haven't looked at the
 
01:59:08.430 --> 01:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
amendment it came in like right before
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
it came up so um but I'm happy to read
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
it and get back to you I it sounds like
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
if it's an opt out it sounds like it
 
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
would not affect um it would not affect
 
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
what we do I mean there is a part to our
 
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
program that is a a survey and we that
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
is already optional for schools and it's
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
not our program I'm sorry we partner
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
with another organization to mind wise
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
Innovations but we we fund it in schools
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and um so the SOS
 
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
program does have a portion that is a a
 
01:59:40.589 --> 01:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
survey and we schools know that that is
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
optional and schools do already if they
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
use it um get an opt in to to use that
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
per New Hampshire law already so thank
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
you very much further questions thank
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%

of folks have not read it and uh so I
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%

unequivocally know that there's a
 
02:03:59.950 --> 02:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
support system ring behind them and
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
cheering them on to encourage their

a better and bright future for
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
themselves the whole child is the
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
priority and it's not defined by their
 
02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
academic performance their adverse
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences or trauma does not
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
define their identity it's clear that
 
02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
there's a mental health crisis of for
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
our youth and it's one of the many
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
challenges that are impacting New
 
02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire amilies prohibiting social
 
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
emotional learning from embedded into
 
02:04:23.549 --> 02:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire education system would
 
02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
only exacerbate these deficits and
 
02:04:26.589 --> 02:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
significant needs for our young gr
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
Staters and their families life can be
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
hard and over the past few years we've
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
certainly seen unforeseen challenges
 
02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
between horrific tragedies through our
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%

02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.390 align:start position:0%
country and a pandemic that's left
Everlasting

02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
Everlasting
 
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
impacts I've seen firsthand the
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
importance of social emotional learning
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
within the functionality of our school
 
02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
culture every single day it aids is a
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
resourceful to tool for not only our
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
students but for the collaborative and
 
02:04:49.069 --> 02:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
development of stronger family and
 
02:04:51.310 --> 02:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
Community Partnerships most importantly
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
while this may sound drastic I have seen
 
02:04:55.870 --> 02:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
save young children's lives we owe it to
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%

opportunities to grow in all
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
developmental areas learning is a
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
relational process students need to
 
02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
maslo before they can bloom it's human
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
instinct to have our basic needs met and
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%

sure can you tell me what Pro if there's
 
02:05:30.669 --> 02:05:30.679 align:start position:0%
a program and what program you use yeah
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um we have used various
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
different programs we've used the second
 
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
step program that's evidence-based
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
driven that someone has mentioned prior
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
to this we've used and choose love as
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
well there's also the ruler
 
02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based program there's path
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
program there's an emotional ABC program
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's geared towards preing
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
kindergarten students that's more
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
interactive and made for their skills
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
that levels um so there's a wide R um
 
02:05:53.709 --> 02:05:53.719 align:start position:0%
that students can choose from schools
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
that meet their needs follow up um U
 
02:05:58.870 --> 02:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
well I'd rather only go with one
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
question now a lot of cards to go here
 
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
represent belra had his hand up also
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony yeah so uh the term
 
02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning was coined by
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
an organization called the Fetzer
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
Institute which for refers to itself as
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
scientific spirituality they spun off
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
Castle um Choose Love says they are
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
aligned with castle and they teach
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
mindfulness can you give us a little bit
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
of information and specifics as to where
 
02:06:26.549 --> 02:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
that line is between things like
 
02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
mindfulness and spirituality sure so
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
mindfulness is more of the grounding
 
02:06:33.149 --> 02:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
method that you can use within a school
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
so if a student is feeling disregulated
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
or stressed you can have them use a
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
mindfulness skill of taking a deep
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
breath using Vis visualization um of a
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
place that brings them Cal place that
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
brings them Zen where they can um reset
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
reregulate to to be able to proceed
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
moving forward so it's not pushing
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
forward any spirituality or religion per
 
02:06:54.549 --> 02:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
se it's really having a student be
 
02:06:56.910 --> 02:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory towards what their needs are
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
if I from this point onwards I'm just
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
going to allow one question from
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee members and that's going to be
 
02:07:07.470 --> 02:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
it uh representative Miler thank you Mr
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%

02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
this in your experience as a counselor
 
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
yeah over the last several years what
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
has been the change
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the needs of the students that you're
 
02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.669 align:start position:0%
in the needs of the students that you're
dealing

02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
dealing
 
02:07:26.589 --> 02:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
with there are a lot of changes I would
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
say from our society in general various
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
different um perspective and opinions a
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
lot of the tragedies and a lot of the
 
02:07:36.669 --> 02:07:36.679 align:start position:0%
the pandemic have made a lot of
 
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
difficulties for our families they
 
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
cannot access the resources that they
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
need they look to the schools for
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
support whether that be for day-to-day
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
um basic needs of clothing food or
 
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
whether they need um you know more of
 
02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
that explicit skills being taught they
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
really look to the schools for that
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
support every single day thank you
 
02:07:57.390 --> 02:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
representa Cornell thank you and thank
 
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
you as a retired 36- year middle school
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor I know what your day
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
is like but you did say embedded in
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum and school culture so I'm
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
assuming this is something that
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
schoolwide embedded in the curriculum
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
School culture can mean a lot of things
 
02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
but it's not taking time out from the
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
day from learning to read and do math
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
math and Core Curriculum uh some
 
02:08:23.069 --> 02:08:23.079 align:start position:0%
components of the day may have an
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
advisory or a morning meeting that can
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
be a quick 10 to 15 minute component of
 
02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
a check-in with a student teachers can
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
say hey how are you just to get a pulse
 
02:08:32.109 --> 02:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
of what they may need that basic needs
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
component right um but it doesn't uh
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
take up a lot of time when you think
 
02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
about if a student walks in the door
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
disregulated and they can't function it
 
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
really gives them that opportunity to
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
reset with the people they trust the
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
most to then be able to be able to learn
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
that school day thank you very much
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%

Deck thank you Linda Phillips of Bristol
 
02:09:08.589 --> 02:09:08.599 align:start position:0%
um I've been a um adopted parent and a
 
02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
foster parent and I had more training in
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
those classes than our teachers do in um
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
expounding the virtues of cell um um
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's very invasive it it encompasses
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
everything there's no boundaries and
 
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
teaching it can include anything from
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
who did you have sex with to uh
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
gender identity issues most parents are
 
02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
unregulated access teachers
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
have they're they're concerned about the
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
promotion of ideological and political
 
02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
ends that are easily SL slipped into
 
02:09:49.149 --> 02:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
sell practices the displacement of
 
02:09:51.629 --> 02:09:51.639 align:start position:0%
academic Vigor the expectation of
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
teachers to act as therapist with
 
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
minimal training and unqualified
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
additional budget cost that cannot be
 
02:10:00.669 --> 02:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
accounted by direct means because it
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
infiltrates every aspect of the school
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
day untrained teachers are allowed to
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
probe into student psyches promoting a
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
holistic schema through which they can
 
02:10:12.669 --> 02:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
children can comprehend their family and
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
their friend relationships medical
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
ethics prohibits practice by unlicensed
 
02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
and untrained individual ual but that
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop anyone puts local school
 
02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
district at risk for educational
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
malpractice or lawsuits software hacks
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
such as what has occurred at the
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
Newfound sa4 last year heightens the
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
security concerns and the privacy of the
 
02:10:38.669 --> 02:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
families with the ongoing weekly monthly
 
02:10:41.549 --> 02:10:41.559 align:start position:0%
data collection process it doesn't stay
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
within the district it goes to another
 
02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
organization that gives out the grant
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
money and it's spread all over the state
 
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
and the questions are asked of the
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
students how much do you weigh how tall
 
02:10:54.990 --> 02:10:55.000 align:start position:0%

Jessica
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
Bickford and Jillian
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
Deck good morning thank you for your
 
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
time this morning my name is Jess
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
Bickford and I'm assistant
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent I've seen many of you
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
several times um so I would like to
 
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
focus most of my testimony on the
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
potential violation for idea and RSA
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
186c that this bill would cause so
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
through the special ed process teams
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
make decisions regarding programming
 
02:12:00.149 --> 02:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
goals assessments things like that that
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
are prescribed by those teams including
 
02:12:05.069 --> 02:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
parent consent and those are mandated by
 
02:12:07.629 --> 02:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
federal and state law this bill would
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
essentially violate that not allowing
 
02:12:12.990 --> 02:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
for a lot of those self-regulation
 
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
self-help Behavioral Management
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
strategies and practices and curriculums
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
that go with that that the team have
 
02:12:20.589 --> 02:12:20.599 align:start position:0%
identified is a must need for that
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
student to make progress along with that
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
comes Public Funding even if they end up
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
in a private school like Spalding or
 
02:12:30.669 --> 02:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
some other Institute that the team feels
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
is necessary for that child to get their
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
needs met um so this bill would also
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
violate those rights of those students
 
02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
and the funding that would go to those
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
private entities because they are
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
publicly funded through the special
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
education process uh I also oppose the
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that is made particularly in
 
02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
regards to lines 6 through 99 because it
 
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
does not qualify that it is a survey of
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
the provision of social emotional
 
02:12:57.549 --> 02:12:57.559 align:start position:0%
learning it says the provision of social
 
02:12:59.549 --> 02:12:59.559 align:start position:0%
emotional learning not the data
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
collection or survey of we already have
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
rules in place to uh allow parents to
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
opt out um and schools to notice parents
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we give surveys like that I've
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
heard testimony today regarding the ybs
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
survey which is a lot of those social
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
emotional type questions parents already
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
have the right to
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
relinquish or not let their child
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
participate in those surveys so I think
 
02:13:25.390 --> 02:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
it would be redundant to include that uh
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
in any of these bills thank you thank
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%

02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.030 align:start position:0%

02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
together to make it a little more
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%

02:14:22.030 --> 02:14:22.040 align:start position:0%

with the amendment um I also wanted to
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
disclose that I do work for new Futures
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm here today to represent myself
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
because this topic is so important to me
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I also want to mentioned that it's
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
important to uh a lot of folks around
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
the state uh more than uh 3,300 folks
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
signed in in opposition to this bill um
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
in the online
 
02:15:05.229 --> 02:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
portal um let's see so Cordelia has been
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
able to take classes and they've been
 
02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
really wonderful for helping her
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
recognize her emotions and manage her
 
02:15:15.549 --> 02:15:15.559 align:start position:0%
big feelings um you know it's this isn't
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
something that's separating schools from
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
families it's something that we can work
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
on together uh she's going to show you
 
02:15:25.709 --> 02:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
the toolbar that they have taught and
 
02:15:27.310 --> 02:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
like this is something that I already
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
had printed out at home before I even
 
02:15:33.310 --> 02:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
heard that this bill existed because it
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
was something that we're trying to work
 
02:15:39.549 --> 02:15:39.559 align:start position:0%
on and extend her learning at at school
 
02:15:43.109 --> 02:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
to uh to home
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh they also do the Choose Love
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
program which you've heard a lot about
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
and it's really special part of her
 
02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
school um you know I I think it's so
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
important that we focus on that part of
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
keeping kids safe because uh you know we
 
02:15:59.470 --> 02:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
we can't turn our schools into prisons
 
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't think families want
 
02:16:04.669 --> 02:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
that we can't afford it anyway um so
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's really important to keep our kids
 
02:16:09.790 --> 02:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
safe in this way you're two minutes but
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard from Cordelia yet
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:23.229 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

02:16:23.229 --> 02:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
honorable chead and members of the
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Cordelia Duo I'm 6
 
02:16:31.149 --> 02:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
years old and in first grade at abot
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
Downing School my mom told me that there
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
could be a new role so kids couldn't
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
take social emotional learning orl
 
02:16:42.349 --> 02:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
classes anymore I did not like that
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
because SEO class helps me stay calm and
 
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
be happier and kinder
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
in first grade we have SEO class every 6
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
days just like gym and music I like it
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so do other kids they taught me what
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
I could do when I got mad at school or
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
at home one thing they teach us is to
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
use the tool bar when you get
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
mad first you pause and
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
breathe that means you take three slow
 
02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.389 align:start position:0%
breathe that means you take three slow
deep

02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
deep
 
02:17:23.709 --> 02:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
breath then you
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
rewind that means to think of about what
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
feeling last you play that means you
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
make a good
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
choice another thing we learned about is
 
02:17:43.389 --> 02:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
breathing that means you trace up when
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
you breathe in on your finger and Trace
 
02:17:53.469 --> 02:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:56.429 --> 02:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
out we also got to go outside for some
 
02:17:59.070 --> 02:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
of our time we learned about being kind
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
on the playground we had a really fun
 
02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:08.669 --> 02:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
Dutcher playworks class is also every
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
six days we Lear fun playground games
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
and how to be kind while we play it's
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
one of our favorite
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
classes we also learn about Choose Love
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
at school some of the parts of Choose
 
02:18:24.990 --> 02:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
Love are courage and gratitude for
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
courage we made a sun and if a grown-up
 
02:18:29.230 --> 02:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
ever saw you do something that was Brave
 
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
they'd give you a sticker and you'd put
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
it on the
 
02:18:36.790 --> 02:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
sun gratitude means that you're thankful
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
for something we made a gratitude tree
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
everyone in the school made a leaf mine
 
02:18:45.549 --> 02:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
said for my doll Caitlyn a bunch of
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:52.519 align:start position:0%
also the whole school learns about being
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
respectful it's one of the things on the
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
signs in the school it means to be kind
 
02:19:00.429 --> 02:19:00.439 align:start position:0%

Freeman

02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
02:20:25.630 --> 02:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for hearing my
 
02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and that's a tough act to
 
02:20:29.550 --> 02:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
follow that's hard to
 
02:20:34.349 --> 02:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
follow um I'm opposed to hb1 1473 um
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
underlying the bill is a is a deep
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
mistrust of teachers that is ironically
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
being fostered by bills like this the
 
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill provided no evidence
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
that teachers in New Hampshire are um
 
02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
changing math question into questions
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
about U marital status or same-sex
 
02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
marriage um in my experience teachers
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
are highly trusted I'm a retired teacher
 
02:20:58.510 --> 02:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
I should have said public school teacher
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
and teachers are trusted and by parents
 
02:21:05.469 --> 02:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
and um teachers deserve to be trusted
 
02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh in fact often parents go to teachers
 
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
and ask them for help on these very
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
skills how how can I help my child have
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
more friends um what can I do how how
 
02:21:19.710 --> 02:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
could my child has doesn't seem to have
 
02:21:21.070 --> 02:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of self-control do you have any
 
02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
advice about that teachers see so many
 
02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
kids yes teachers are not psychologists
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
they have taken courses in child
 
02:21:28.990 --> 02:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
psychology they know about child
 
02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
development but they see so many
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
children that often parents just ask
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
them for that kind of advice I think
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
they are are trusted and they are worthy
 
02:21:40.510 --> 02:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
of trust um the definition in this bill
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
is so broad that it's impossible to
 
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
comply whether it's the original bill or
 
02:21:47.309 --> 02:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment um and I just would like
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
like to give a couple of examples maybe
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
some of you like me had first day
 
02:21:53.309 --> 02:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
jitters the first day of school
 
02:21:54.910 --> 02:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
especially going off to a new school
 
02:21:56.590 --> 02:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
maybe Middle School maybe kindergarten
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
maybe high school and um so as a teacher
 
02:22:02.110 --> 02:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
on those first days you do a lot of
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
games and activities to help kids get to
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
know each other feel comfortable with
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
you as the teacher they're all
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
non-cognitive they're all social and um
 
02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
if we were going to not do that the
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
first day of middle school kids would
 
02:22:16.270 --> 02:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
have walked into my CL math class I
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
would have said hello my is name is Miss
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
wil please sit down and get out your
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
math book that's not the way we treat
 
02:22:22.750 --> 02:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
human beings that's how we would treat a
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
robot who was there to be fed some kind
 
02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
of data um other examples are it those
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
bill says you know no you can't have
 
02:22:33.389 --> 02:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
policies activities Etc about
 
02:22:35.830 --> 02:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
self-management that means literally I
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to set an expectation
 
02:22:38.590 --> 02:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
that you raise your hand before you
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
speak um relationship skills none of
 
02:22:42.990 --> 02:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
that I can't talk about we couldn't have
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
a policy about bullying I know that
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
sounds common sense with say that's
 
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
ridiculous but that's what the law says
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
we can't individually decide what's
 
02:22:52.750 --> 02:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
common sense when there's a law we have
 
02:22:55.870 --> 02:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
to follow the law um no responsible
 
02:22:58.030 --> 02:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
decision-making can be discussed or
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
addressed or activities around so no
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
more consequences for coming to school
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
without your homework um I just feel
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
there are so many problems in this state
 
02:23:08.429 --> 02:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
so many things that you are all elected
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
to uh to address that are really
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
important and this bill is answering a
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist and it's once
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
again undermining trust in public school
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
teachers who teach close to 90% of the
 
02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
kids in this state thank you thank you
 
02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions
 
02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
representative belshire thank you Mr
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your testimony uh
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
you just testified that there's no lack
 
02:23:35.550 --> 02:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
of uh trust or faith um in teachers but
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at a Washington Post article
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
from 2022 the Stark drop in faith
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that only 28% of Americans
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
have faith in public schools are are you
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
saying that there's nothing behind that
 
02:23:50.269 --> 02:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
number it's not happening well first of
 
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
all I didn't say there is no lack of
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
trust because I see lack of trust here
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
um but I'm saying that the parents I ran
 
02:23:59.309 --> 02:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
into and I taught a thousand children
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
more than a thousand children none of
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
them indicated to me that they did not
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
trust their Public School teachers I
 
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
haven't read that article I have no idea
 
02:24:07.150 --> 02:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
what the survey was I don't know if it
 
02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
was valid or not so I can't address that
 
02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you very much thank you
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
have a good afternoon Aubrey fredman
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
sey uh Mr chair committee members Aubrey
 
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
Friedman from Bridgewater I speak in
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
support of this bill okay we are turning
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
our schools into medical centers what
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
happened to teaching basic academic
 
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
skills I mean if I would say if our
 
02:24:42.269 --> 02:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates were 90% or better
 
02:24:43.870 --> 02:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
then okay maybe we can work on some
 
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
other stuff they're not they're way low
 
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm in the Newfound district and our
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
Ela is up slightly but our math and
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
science are in the 30s and 40s so
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work to be done we
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
should not have how this is a
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
distraction and by the way it is actual
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
classes that they are in so like a 1
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
hour period or 45 minutes or whatever
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
because I know the question came up it
 
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
is actually not working on math or
 
02:25:14.110 --> 02:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
reading or whatever it is actual these
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
skills so it is taking they're only
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
there for 6 hours hours a day whatever
 
02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
it is is taking away from academics on
 
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
the data collection I got a bunch of
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
backup here I'm sorry I didn't make 20
 
02:25:28.190 --> 02:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
copies but please watch the video and
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
there's also a transcript in here and I
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
highlighted and we talk about data
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
collection and um I'm not saying that
 
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
the uh this Zoom meeting at the
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
department of uh education was with the
 
02:25:44.190 --> 02:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
school counselors and what it is really
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
the way they talk about hiding things
 
02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
from parents collecting the data we got
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
to get parental consent but you know uh
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
we how do you kind of skirt it by the
 
02:25:57.070 --> 02:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
parents it is very revealing please
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
watch it or at least read the uh
 
02:26:01.469 --> 02:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
transcript so when we talk about lack of
 
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
trust when I watched that it was a zoom
 
02:26:07.269 --> 02:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
meeting I was it just infuriates me
 
02:26:10.349 --> 02:26:10.359 align:start position:0%

radar here lastly the whole wscc whole
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
school whole child whole community this
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
whole seal thing was designed by the CDC
 
02:26:22.469 --> 02:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
should we really trust them they're the
 
02:26:24.990 --> 02:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
ones who messed up during the pandemic
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
so it's all designed from them and I
 
02:26:32.269 --> 02:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
really question taking this uh whole uh
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%

that solves problems through policy
 
02:27:36.269 --> 02:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
change I am here in strong uh opposition
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
to house full 1473 as written and the
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
amendment uh because it would put
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
students at risk of losing out in in
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
education that could support them
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
throughout their lives um traumatic
 
02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
events in in a children's lifetime are
 
02:27:50.510 --> 02:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
called adverse childhood experiences
 
02:27:52.269 --> 02:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
commonly they're commonly referred to as
 
02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
that um also known as Aces um and
 
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing even Four Aces throughout a
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
childhood puts someone at Great risk for
 
02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
um long-standing um lifelong health and
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
mental Wellness uh conditions these
 
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
include uh anxiety depression uh
 
02:28:13.269 --> 02:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder having protective
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
factors against those Aces is critical
 
02:28:19.269 --> 02:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
in mitigating the the uh consequences to
 
02:28:21.389 --> 02:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
experiencing those asay um social
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
emotional learning gives students the
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
tools to uh create those protective
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
factors against Aces and carry that
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
throughout their
 
02:28:33.630 --> 02:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
lifetime in addition um social emotional
 
02:28:36.269 --> 02:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
learning is um by and large a
 
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
partnership between schools and parents
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
so um for instance mtssb the program you
 
02:28:44.269 --> 02:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
heard about from the sponsor and a
 
02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
couple other folks um really emphasizes
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
the partnership between parents and the
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
schools and ensures that parents are not
 
02:28:55.630 --> 02:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
only informed and given the chance to um
 
02:28:57.950 --> 02:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
partake in the program but also extend
 
02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
the learning at at home and it's a core
 
02:29:02.269 --> 02:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
feature of of that
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
framework um finally parents and
 
02:29:07.309 --> 02:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
caregivers are largely supportive of
 
02:29:11.269 --> 02:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning um 86% of
 
02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
respondents to the 603 bright future
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
survey which is given to families that
 
02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh attend public schools in New
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um stated that they were in
 
02:29:21.269 --> 02:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
agreement with the statement that social
 
02:29:22.830 --> 02:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
emotional learning was important to
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
include in addition to academics and
 
02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
schools um I'll wrap up there but I will
 
02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to vote itl on thank
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
you very much are there
 
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you uh Bonnie
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:53.469 align:start position:0%
 
Breen

02:29:53.469 --> 02:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
sorry for the committee we have enough
 
02:29:57.870 --> 02:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
cards to go another 45 minutes
 
02:30:00.269 --> 02:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
so you have to take a break to go to the
 
02:30:02.269 --> 02:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
washroom or something go ahead and do
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
that hi I'm Bonnie dham I live in marac
 
02:30:06.910 --> 02:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm here as a parent
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
of somebody who benefited from education
 
02:30:12.349 --> 02:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
special education and social emotional
 
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
learning I'm stunned as to why someone
 
02:30:16.990 --> 02:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
would want to discourage never mind
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit social and emotional learning
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
in schools isn't promoting schools in um
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
in Civic engagement a good thing don't
 
02:30:25.389 --> 02:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
we want our kids to grow up to be good
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
citizens to have skills in the areas of
 
02:30:30.269 --> 02:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
self-management relationship building
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
responsible decision making and
 
02:30:35.550 --> 02:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
behaviors that that just makes sense um
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is particularly problematic
 
02:30:38.670 --> 02:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
though for children with disabilities
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
who may have delays or deficits in areas
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
that include social emotional
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
development or social interaction skills
 
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
I have one of those people in my house
 
02:30:49.870 --> 02:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
um and so I know how important it is for
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
those skills to be taught um and
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes some real purposeful
 
02:30:57.070 --> 02:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
teaching IEPs according to the federal
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
and state law must address both academic
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
and functional performance and
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
functional and performance includes
 
02:31:06.269 --> 02:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
skills and behaviors in areas including
 
02:31:09.630 --> 02:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
social skills and um and and emotional
 
02:31:12.750 --> 02:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
development and once those areas have
 
02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
been identified then there needs to be
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
an annual goal in there they need to be
 
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
progress needs to be measured um and
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
idea also emphasizes the use of positive
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
behavior interventions and supports for
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
particularly for children who need them
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
and that involves teaching both
 
02:31:31.790 --> 02:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
self-management and behavioral skills I
 
02:31:33.429 --> 02:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's the intent but this
 
02:31:37.269 --> 02:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%

02:32:15.279 --> 02:32:19.630 align:start position:0%
 
deoy

02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
we on this one right now hi my name is
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
Mary D I am a uh former teacher and a
 
02:32:29.269 --> 02:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
retired mental health counselor for
 
02:32:33.309 --> 02:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
children um I'm I here to oppose
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
1473 um we all have social emotional
 
02:32:40.510 --> 02:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
health and from from birth to death and
 
02:32:43.389 --> 02:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
as adults we know what we need to do if
 
02:32:45.550 --> 02:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
we have problems if we need some
 
02:32:47.309 --> 02:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
professional help we can get the help
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
that we need as children they're just
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
learning hopefully the foundations for
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
frustration or impulse to um control
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
friendship skills and how to how to make
 
02:33:03.469 --> 02:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
friends um if they don't learn this then
 
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
those problems or feelings identified
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
with them intensify and multiply so as
 
02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
they get older they have additional
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
problems we all know of people who
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
haven't had social emotional help in
 
02:33:20.910 --> 02:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
their lives look at the drug overdoses
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we have which is on the rise of New
 
02:33:24.990 --> 02:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire look at the suicides committed
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
which is on the rise in New Hampshire
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
and look at how often do you hear of
 
02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
mass Shooters who were loners who didn't
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
have friends who kept to themselves so
 
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
the root of all of this are feelings
 
02:33:42.269 --> 02:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
that need to be identified when children
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
are young and they need to be worked
 
02:33:45.790 --> 02:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
through because if they're not worked
 
02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:47.349 align:start position:0%
through because if they're not worked
through

02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
these issues are the result of it so I'm
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
definitely opposed to this to me we
 
02:33:56.110 --> 02:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
think we have we need more problems uh I
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me more programs that deal
 
02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:04.990 --> 02:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
health thank you very much are there any
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank

02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
sperman followed
 
02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:19.750 align:start position:0%
sperman followed
by

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%

afternoon good afternoon um I'm here
 
02:34:34.269 --> 02:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
testifying um
 
02:34:38.429 --> 02:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
about I'm not against teaching uh skills
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
but the problem is that the programs
 
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
that the schools that um that are
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
purchasing these seal programs are
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
crossing the line
 
02:34:49.389 --> 02:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
um schools are replacing academics with
 
02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
secl and this is the castle program
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're the parent company um they're
 
02:34:55.309 --> 02:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
creating student
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
activists they're saying the school is
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
their safe space not the family they are
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
constantly giving out surveys and data
 
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
collection um when I was a child we all
 
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
heard about your permanent record oh
 
02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to go on your permanent
 
02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
record well now these kids are going to
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
have this permanent record and this data
 
02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be out there forever and
 
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
they're never going to be able to escape
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
it so is that permanent record going to
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
be used in the future about getting a
 
02:35:23.269 --> 02:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
job joining the Army um getting a loan
 
02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
for something you did in third grade or
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
said in third grade um and I keep
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
hearing about parental consent is this
 
02:35:31.389 --> 02:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
really informed consent that these
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
parents are getting they're getting told
 
02:35:35.230 --> 02:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
that hey there's this program and you
 
02:35:36.990 --> 02:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
know check out the website that we have
 
02:35:41.070 --> 02:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
on this on the sa's uh website that just
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
gives you a very top layer of
 
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
information about anyl proam program we
 
02:35:49.389 --> 02:35:49.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what are all the details and
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
the guts about every lesson plan unless
 
02:35:55.510 --> 02:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
you file a right to know act um and then
 
02:35:57.389 --> 02:35:57.399 align:start position:0%
i' also like to say that you know the
 
02:35:59.870 --> 02:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
gentleman up here with um the dog and
 
02:36:01.710 --> 02:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
doing the comfort and care and
 
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
everything I'm very concerned that that
 
02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
child whether that child knew that the
 
02:36:07.870 --> 02:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
information they wrote on that piece of
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
paper and threw away that information in
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
the waste basket was anyone else going
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
to access that
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
information and did the people did read
 
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
that information did they have the right
 
02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
to read it and did they have the right
 
02:36:21.469 --> 02:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
to know that information and if that
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
information happened to have said
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
something that there was abuse going on
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
who was going to contact the authorities
 
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
at that point and was what that child
 
02:36:32.670 --> 02:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
wrote was that going to be inferred that
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
there was actual abuse going on your
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
time is
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%

02:36:39.439 --> 02:36:40.550 align:start position:0%

nine years turned educational consultant
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%

encourage you to join me our presence at
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
this meeting and maybe even going
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
through this meeting required us to
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
utilize essential skills
 
02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
time management planning organizing
 
02:37:21.950 --> 02:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
decision making and perhaps a dash of
 
02:37:23.269 --> 02:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
motivation or
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
perseverance these seal skills vital in
 
02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
adulthood must be nurtured from
 
02:37:30.269 --> 02:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
childhood to empower individuals to
 
02:37:32.510 --> 02:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
reach their potential and contribute
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
positively to
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
society in my 20 years of education
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
including teaching in both affluent and
 
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged schools I've
 
02:37:43.469 --> 02:37:43.479 align:start position:0%
observed Seal's crucial role in enabling
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
all students to access education and
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
succeed when I was hired in the
 
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
Nashville School District I was warned
 
02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
about the challenging nature of the
 
02:37:53.950 --> 02:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
incoming fifth grade class one story
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
among many stands out about the power of
 
02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
in nurturing their profound growth years
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
later a former student reached out to
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
share a pivotal moment from that year
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
with me the student was faced with
 
02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
pressure to join his older brother's
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
gang despite the Temptation the
 
02:38:11.389 --> 02:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
supportive environment of our classroom
 
02:38:14.269 --> 02:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
convinced him otherwise he credited that
 
02:38:16.269 --> 02:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
year as a time that he found genuine
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
friendship care from classmates and
 
02:38:21.309 --> 02:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
teachers and a vision for his potential
 
02:38:24.750 --> 02:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
Beyond gang life a robust body of
 
02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
evidence highlights the positive effects
 
02:38:29.630 --> 02:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
ofal on academics the research comes
 
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
from numerous sources including the
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
institute for Education sciences and the
 
02:38:36.429 --> 02:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
National Institutes of Health all of
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
which have undergone rigorous review in
 
02:38:40.990 --> 02:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
an increasingly interconnected and
 
02:38:43.710 --> 02:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
diverse worldl skills are highly prized
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
by employers and vital for success in
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
all areas of life prohibiting through HB
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
1473 would stifle students personal
 
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
growth hamper academic achievement and
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
limit their capacity to thrive in an

hook for me the most rewarding in part
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the Face Off Friends program is
 
02:40:49.469 --> 02:40:49.479 align:start position:0%

how they took a brave breath or showed a
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
growth mindset and even more seeing them

on a finite group of children I am
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
confident it will benefit Public Schools
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
where the program can reach and teach a
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%

our community I teach the Face Off

the Boys and Girls Club while helping
 
02:42:38.269 --> 02:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
teach this curriculum I've noticed girls
 
02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
who are unfamiliar with the sport come
 
02:42:42.269 --> 02:42:42.279 align:start position:0%
together and make important connections
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
I have observed children who at first
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
seemed hesitant about the sport
 
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
consistently return each time we visited
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
and be excited about trying something
 
02:42:52.110 --> 02:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
new and gaining confidence each session
 
02:42:54.070 --> 02:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
chose love not only promotes important
 
02:42:56.510 --> 02:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
qualities like courage and forgiveness
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
but it also creates an important
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
Community it encourages kids to try
 
02:43:01.590 --> 02:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
something new and get out of their
 
02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
comfort zone in a safe and encouraging
 
02:43:07.389 --> 02:43:07.399 align:start position:0%
environment in 2023 the United States
 
02:43:08.910 --> 02:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
Surgeon General released a report
 
02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.479 align:start position:0%

loneliness and mental health challenges
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
that young people confront he noted that
 
02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
the loneliness and isolation increases
 
02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
the risk of depression and anxiety for
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
children and teens it is especially
 
02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
important to have programs that build
 
02:43:25.790 --> 02:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
social connections and Foster Community
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
as a way to promote well-being for young
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
people choose love is the type of
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
program that creates a culture of
 
02:43:32.670 --> 02:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
connection between people which is so
 
02:43:34.429 --> 02:43:34.439 align:start position:0%

children at the Manchester Boys and
 
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
Girls Club I believe Choose Love is the
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
type of program that would benefit
 
02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%

02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
years accessing social emotional
 
02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
learning or seal in schools is a vital
 
02:45:08.269 --> 02:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
part of getting a good education I think
 
02:45:10.429 --> 02:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
we've seen some evidence of that today
 
02:45:12.670 --> 02:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
seal provides a framework to
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
intentionally build skills such as
 
02:45:17.309 --> 02:45:17.319 align:start position:0%

Management and collaboration the
 
02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
intentional integration ofal provides

young people with crucial life skills
 
02:45:27.830 --> 02:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
necessary for academic success seal
 
02:45:30.190 --> 02:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
skills and academics actually complement
 
02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
each other rather than compete with each
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
other I oppose this bill because it
 
02:45:37.070 --> 02:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
would prevent Educators from actually

applying the latest research on learning
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
and child development in order to
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
maximize the potential of all students
 
02:45:47.469 --> 02:45:47.479 align:start position:0%
the bill also runs counter to the
 
02:45:49.230 --> 02:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
Strategic plan of the conquered School
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
District which prioritizes the
 
02:45:52.830 --> 02:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
development of the whole child and
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes that separating academic
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
achievement from social emotional skill
 
02:45:59.349 --> 02:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
development would negatively impact our
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
ability for a successful education of
 
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:03.550 align:start position:0%
ability for a successful education of
our

02:46:03.550 --> 02:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
students I wanted to share a little bit
 
02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
about what seal might look like I think
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of that but just a few
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
examples when a child puts their head
 
02:46:15.070 --> 02:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
down on a desk and they're discouraged
 
02:46:17.110 --> 02:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
the teacher has already worked with that
 
02:46:18.910 --> 02:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
student in the classroom to develop
 
02:46:21.389 --> 02:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
language around growth mindset and
 
02:46:23.710 --> 02:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
strategies that they can use to then
 
02:46:26.670 --> 02:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
Coach the child in that moment toward
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
re-engagement instead of losing the
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
child we're now re-engaging the child
 
02:46:33.230 --> 02:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
for their education it is building a
 
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
toolbox of strategies to maintain stress
 
02:46:38.750 --> 02:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh manage stress in a positive way by
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
the time a high school high achieving
 
02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
high school student is struggling to
 
02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
manage a strenuous workload they have
 
02:46:46.349 --> 02:46:46.359 align:start position:0%

field of scci in the science of human
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
development and learning your time is up
 
02:47:01.349 --> 02:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you well I wanted to one more
 
02:47:02.990 --> 02:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
thing is that the castle framework I
 
02:47:05.030 --> 02:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
want to clarify it is a framework it
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
does not provide a social emotional
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
learning curriculum it's a framework
 
02:47:11.389 --> 02:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
that you can use to develop a social
 
02:47:14.269 --> 02:47:14.279 align:start position:0%
emotional learning curriculum with so I
 
02:47:15.469 --> 02:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clar ify that because
 
02:47:17.269 --> 02:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
I've heard that mentioned several times
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it does not require the collection
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
of data um on and especially personal
 
02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
data on students thank you for the
 
02:47:28.190 --> 02:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
clarification uh representative
 
02:47:30.190 --> 02:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um regarding the
 
02:47:33.950 --> 02:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
Choose Love movement
 
02:47:38.590 --> 02:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
inal um in June of 2023 the uh State
 
02:47:40.510 --> 02:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education tweeted out an
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
image from the Choose Love movement
 
02:47:46.590 --> 02:47:46.600 align:start position:0%

ways people can help care for themselves
 
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
now most of the stuff doesn't raise an
 
02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
eyebrow except one thing on here it says
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
it says appreciate your assets and
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's a little emoji of a peach now
 
02:47:59.910 --> 02:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
for background on this the peach Emoji
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
has been banned in a lot of social media
 
02:48:03.950 --> 02:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
because it's often used to symbolize
 
02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
genitalia can you speak to what exactly
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
this is trying to tell children to do
 
02:48:09.070 --> 02:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
and has how it has to do with social
 
02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
and has how it has to do with social
emotional

02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
learning I have no idea about what the
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
peach represents but I do know that we
 
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
talk a lot about developing student
 
02:48:20.349 --> 02:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
assets um and that when we have these
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
skills they become assets for us to in
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
order to thrive in the in school and
 
02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
Beyond in the workplace so I'm sorry I
 
02:48:29.070 --> 02:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that reference further

good morning committee for the record my
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
name is Patricia Tilly I am an associate
 
02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner with the Department of
 
02:48:53.469 --> 02:48:53.479 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I am also
 
02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
proudly uh happen to be a former middle
 
02:48:58.429 --> 02:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
school teacher in a former life I'm
 
02:48:59.710 --> 02:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
representing the Department of Health
 
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
and Human Services opposition to hp1
 
02:49:05.469 --> 02:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
1473 it is Impractical and has wide
 
02:49:07.870 --> 02:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
reaching and undeterminable effects that
 
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
you have heard for the past few hours we
 
02:49:12.269 --> 02:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
have only now seen the amendment as you
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
have but the original language as
 
02:49:16.750 --> 02:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
introduced would prohibit any program
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
that even sniffs of Social and emotional
 
02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
language and it would eliminate
 
02:49:23.150 --> 02:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for surveys such as the
 
02:49:25.710 --> 02:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
yrbs I want to begin by agreeing
 
02:49:27.229 --> 02:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly with the sponsor and
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
others in this room that the with the
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
fundamental belief that social and
 
02:49:33.630 --> 02:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
emotional learning starts at home
 
02:49:35.830 --> 02:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
parents and caregivers play the most
 
02:49:38.910 --> 02:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
important and primary role in teaching
 
02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
and modeling healthy Social Development
 
02:49:43.590 --> 02:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
and relationships but as you have heard
 
02:49:46.269 --> 02:49:46.279 align:start position:0%
here today from students to teachers all
 
02:49:48.190 --> 02:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
of us have a part to play there can
 
02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
never be too many trusted and skilled
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
adults in a child's life to help
 
02:49:54.229 --> 02:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
navigate complex emotions that we can
 
02:49:56.229 --> 02:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
prevent the outcomes of emotional
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
physical and sexual abuse and violence
 
02:50:00.910 --> 02:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
as well as poor academic performance due
 
02:50:03.030 --> 02:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
to the inability to effectively
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
communicate in groups and peer
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
relationships there are hundreds of
 
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
studies that support this notion that is
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
why the Department of Health and Human
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
Services supports programs in schools
 
02:50:15.309 --> 02:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
that develop Partnerships with amilies
 
02:50:18.550 --> 02:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
and schools uh based on Mutual trust
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
understanding and civility across
 
02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
differences none of these programs
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the powerful role of caregivers
 
02:50:26.830 --> 02:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
rather they enhance the Notions of
 
02:50:29.950 --> 02:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
kindness respect and empathy that is
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
learned at home but with 44% of New
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School students reporting
 
02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
feeling sad or hopeless in the past year
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
among girls alone that bumps up close to
 
02:50:41.550 --> 02:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
60% and the epidemic of loneliness that
 
02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
you've heard about already there is no
 
02:50:45.469 --> 02:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
doubt that student wellness impacts
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
academic import um performance and
 
02:50:50.469 --> 02:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
academic environments sadly underscoring
 
02:50:52.349 --> 02:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
this data we are faced with the fact
 
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
that suicide is the leading cause of
 
02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
death among 10 to 23 year olds in New
 
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we believe that even with the
 
02:51:04.830 --> 02:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
amendment hb1 1473 puts forward the
 
02:51:06.870 --> 02:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
following Department funded programs are
 
02:51:09.229 --> 02:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
at risk New Hampshire student assistant
 
02:51:11.389 --> 02:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
programs they are school-based programs
 
02:51:13.269 --> 02:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
funded by the department in more than 70
 
02:51:15.389 --> 02:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
communities to provide support to middle
 
02:51:17.229 --> 02:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
and high school students struggling with
 
02:51:19.309 --> 02:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
individual family and peer challenges
 
02:51:21.710 --> 02:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you your your time is up great
 
02:51:23.229 --> 02:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I will just sum by saying we
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
have written testimony that we will pass
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
around there are a number of programs
 
02:51:29.150 --> 02:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
that would all be defunded even with
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment the language is
 
02:51:33.550 --> 02:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
Impractical thank you questions from for
 
02:51:36.590 --> 02:51:36.600 align:start position:0%

speak uh please speak to the propriety
 
02:51:42.990 --> 02:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
of an executive agency taking a position

on a bill and how that is not a conf ICT
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
of Interest or ethics violation sure
 
02:51:48.229 --> 02:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
there is State Statute that allows that
 
02:51:49.630 --> 02:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
I can't think of the number off the top
 
02:51:52.229 --> 02:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
of my head we must um identify ourselves
 
02:51:54.429 --> 02:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
as members of the executive agency and
 
02:51:57.070 --> 02:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
we have the authority and statute to to
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
take a position thank you thank

02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
good good thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee members I'll keep it brief
 
02:55:12.309 --> 02:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
you've heard all of tremendous evidence
 
02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
on the effectiveness of SEO the one
 
02:55:16.750 --> 02:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
argument that seems to be coming back is
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
does it conflict with academic studies
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
because you're using time that could be
 
02:55:23.469 --> 02:55:23.479 align:start position:0%
spent there so a little research on that
 
02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
there's a study done reported in child
 
02:55:29.870 --> 02:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
development uh and it's a review of
 
02:55:33.590 --> 02:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
97,000 students from 82 schools who took
 
02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
place in Seal programs the study showed
 
02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
that three and a half years after their
 
02:55:41.269 --> 02:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
last seal inv involvement students fared
 
02:55:43.229 --> 02:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
marketly better academically than their
 
02:55:45.070 --> 02:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
peers in control grp groups by an
 
02:55:47.910 --> 02:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
average of 13 percentile points based on
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
eight studies that measured academics so
 
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
if you're worried about the performance
 
02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
scores and schools this just tells you
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
and you heard the reason child comes in
 
02:55:57.870 --> 02:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
they're not set to start work for the
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
day the day is a mess for them you do
 
02:56:02.550 --> 02:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
some work to help them get centered the
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
child has a productive day after seal
 
02:56:07.550 --> 02:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
your scores for as a school go up 13
 
02:56:10.110 --> 02:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
percentage points that would be huge we
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
certainly shouldn't fight against that
 
02:56:15.150 --> 02:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
it also said that it reduces drug use
 
02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
and emotional distress another study
 
02:56:20.190 --> 02:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
from Columbia University this one was in
 
02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Journal of benefit cost
 
02:56:24.670 --> 02:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
analysis uh says that seal programs
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
return $11 for every dollar invested
 
02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
this report from Columbia University
 
02:56:30.870 --> 02:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
details a benefit cost analysis
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
evaluating six seal intervention
 
02:56:35.870 --> 02:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
programs that shows an average return on
 
02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
investment of $11 for every dollar spent
 
02:56:41.469 --> 02:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
so it not only increases academic scores
 
02:56:43.630 --> 02:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
it saves the schools money it's a
 
02:56:45.269 --> 02:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
productive program how does it do this
 
02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
it reduces child aggression substance
 
02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
abuse delinquency and violence students
 
02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
don't end up missing school if they feel
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
like school is a safe place to be if
 
02:56:57.150 --> 02:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
students aren't there how are they going
 
02:56:59.630 --> 02:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
to get academic progress it also lowers
 
02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
levels of depression and anxiety it
 
02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
increases grades it increases attendance
 
02:57:06.309 --> 02:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
and performance in core academic
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
subjects that question was asked half a
 
02:57:10.030 --> 02:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
dozen times so I think hopefully these
 
02:57:11.550 --> 02:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
will answer that thank you Mr chair
 
02:57:13.429 --> 02:57:13.439 align:start position:0%

gone then be Tera
 
02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
font following thank welcome John thank
 
02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
you how do you say your last name uh
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
udas okay I gu best pronounced all the
 
02:57:41.229 --> 02:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
time that's okay um I'm a licensed
 
02:57:42.990 --> 02:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social worker and a
 
02:57:45.630 --> 02:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
master's license alcohol drug counselor
 
02:57:46.670 --> 02:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I won't repeat too many of the
 
02:57:49.229 --> 02:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
points I already made but um up here as
 
02:57:50.590 --> 02:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
a citizen right now because I saw the
 
02:57:53.150 --> 02:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislative alert about this bill and it
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
struck a chord because I've been asked
 
02:57:57.229 --> 02:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
in this room before and in other public
 
02:57:58.670 --> 02:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
forums when I was serving on different
 
02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
boards the providers
 
02:58:03.870 --> 02:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
Association um and nasw about what's the
 
02:58:07.150 --> 02:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
best prevention for addiction especially
 
02:58:08.670 --> 02:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
which is something that I'm an expert on
 
02:58:11.830 --> 02:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
I taught classes at UNH for it um and I
 
02:58:13.710 --> 02:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
always say it's teaching kids between
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
the the age of like five and 12 how to
 
02:58:19.309 --> 02:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
identify their emotions ground
 
02:58:21.630 --> 02:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
themselves calm themselves down ask for
 
02:58:23.830 --> 02:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
what they need in a more productive way
 
02:58:25.990 --> 02:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's what my understanding of
 
02:58:28.750 --> 02:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning is um if there
 
02:58:31.229 --> 02:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
are other studies and data and questions
 
02:58:33.150 --> 02:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
that could ask like perhaps the
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
amendment putting some limits on that
 
02:58:36.910 --> 02:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
could help a little bit but removing
 
02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
this from curriculum is sort of
 
02:58:40.349 --> 02:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
impossible and I don't know why you
 
02:58:42.229 --> 02:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
would want to do it because it would
 
02:58:45.070 --> 02:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
just cause way more problems than it
 
02:58:47.910 --> 02:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
solves um and to answer the question
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
that representative Bel had asked
 
02:58:51.910 --> 02:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
earlier about forgiveness and how that
 
02:58:54.510 --> 02:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
activity helps someone um there's a lot
 
02:58:56.590 --> 02:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
of research that connects forgiveness to
 
02:58:59.030 --> 02:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
mental health but the bottom line is
 
02:59:01.150 --> 02:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
it's kind of Common Sense Neuroscience
 
02:59:03.070 --> 02:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
that if someone is distracted and
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
escalated about um an emotional issue
 
02:59:07.469 --> 02:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
then they're not going to be able to
 
02:59:10.910 --> 02:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
attend to any academic learning so um
 
02:59:12.150 --> 02:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to teach kids so
 
02:59:14.110 --> 02:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
that they can be successful academically
 
02:59:16.110 --> 02:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
and socially and prevent drug overdose
 
02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
and prevent addiction and prevent them
 
02:59:20.190 --> 02:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
from ending up in programs like the one
 
02:59:22.670 --> 02:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
that I operate in the Sea Coast which is
 
02:59:24.309 --> 02:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
for adults with addiction and mental
 
02:59:28.150 --> 02:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
health problems so um I think everything
 
02:59:29.950 --> 02:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
else has been touched on but I just like
 
02:59:31.229 --> 02:59:31.239 align:start position:0%
I said I'm not a part of any of those
 
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
boards anymore but when I saw this
 
02:59:35.070 --> 02:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
legislation being proposed I felt like I
 
02:59:37.150 --> 02:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
needed to explain that that's that's how
 
02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
you prevent those problems from
 
02:59:42.110 --> 02:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
happening later in life so thank you
 
02:59:43.870 --> 02:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:59:46.110 --> 02:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
02:59:50.790 --> 02:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:55.630 --> 02:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:02.309 --> 03:00:02.319 align:start position:0%

03:00:35.469 --> 03:00:35.479 align:start position:0%
program after the Uval school shooting I
 
03:00:36.910 --> 03:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
had reached out and started working with
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
Shannon and Scarlet Lewis um I just want
 
03:00:43.070 --> 03:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
to provide clarification on a couple of
 
03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
things if I May um excuse me I have to
 
03:00:48.510 --> 03:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
breathe the Choose Love movement does
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
not do any data collection of the
 
03:00:53.469 --> 03:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
children the Choose Love movement does
 
03:00:56.229 --> 03:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
ask Educators if they want to provide
 
03:00:58.229 --> 03:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
feedback as people would with any
 
03:01:01.229 --> 03:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
program nor do they require money so you
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
can opt into other programs with in
 
03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
choose love but you do not have to pay
 
03:01:09.389 --> 03:01:09.399 align:start position:0%
anything UPF front so how I became
 
03:01:11.269 --> 03:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
involved in choose love with ubaldi
 
03:01:13.830 --> 03:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
school shooting is I had employed choose
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
love with Recycled Percussion into an
 
03:01:18.229 --> 03:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
anti-bullying event in Newport New
 
03:01:21.150 --> 03:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and someone here asked that
 
03:01:24.229 --> 03:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
was in April of last year someone in
 
03:01:28.190 --> 03:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
here asked how have you seen this move
 
03:01:30.790 --> 03:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
forward so coincidentally or
 
03:01:33.630 --> 03:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
fortuitously last week I met a girl who
 
03:01:36.190 --> 03:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
was from Newport New Hampshire who told
 
03:01:38.110 --> 03:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
me that her mother taught in the school
 
03:01:41.429 --> 03:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
system and I said oh I had helped
 
03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
facilitate an event there did you buy
 
03:01:45.750 --> 03:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
any chance did your mom say anything and
 
03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
she said nope my mom didn't say anything
 
03:01:50.710 --> 03:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
but my younger brother who is in eighth
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
grade said the woman that spoke there
 
03:01:54.910 --> 03:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
and she said is her name Scarlet I said
 
03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
yes it is and she said that story
 
03:02:01.710 --> 03:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
resonated with him and he has made it a
 
03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
point to be kind and
 
03:02:08.269 --> 03:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
courageous and considerate and
 
03:02:10.510 --> 03:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
compassionate to the children in his
 
03:02:13.830 --> 03:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
school and to look for that little boy a
 
03:02:17.229 --> 03:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
little girl who may not seem like
 
03:02:19.790 --> 03:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
everybody else but perhaps needs a
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
little compassion that was back in April
 
03:02:26.389 --> 03:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
of 2023 your time is up and it still
 
03:02:28.349 --> 03:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
resonates today that's all thank you
 
03:02:29.790 --> 03:02:29.800 align:start position:0%

you hello I just want to start off by
 
03:03:09.630 --> 03:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
saying wow those kids said it all um I
 
03:03:11.590 --> 03:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
am a third grade teacher and I have been
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
teaching in Nashua for 24 years years
 
03:03:17.710 --> 03:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
and I absolutely oppose this bill and it
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
is with passion I teach at uh seal um
 
03:03:25.030 --> 03:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
the National School District uses the
 
03:03:27.429 --> 03:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
Choose Love program and for those of you
 
03:03:30.510 --> 03:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
who are not familiar with that um Choose
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
Love was created by Scarlet Lewis when
 
03:03:38.910 --> 03:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
so sadly her child was shot and killed
 
03:03:42.110 --> 03:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
in the Sandy Hook shooting and she was
 
03:03:44.950 --> 03:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
devastated as any parent as any person
 
03:03:48.110 --> 03:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
would be and she came back from home and
 
03:03:50.830 --> 03:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
on the chalkboard her child Jesse had
 
03:03:54.349 --> 03:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
written in his first grade writing uh a
 
03:03:57.349 --> 03:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
few words courage
 
03:03:59.790 --> 03:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
forgiveness and it really resonated with
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
her and she felt so compelled to it just
 
03:04:07.309 --> 03:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
sort of came to her this is her life's
 
03:04:09.790 --> 03:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
meaning uh to create the Choose Love
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
program and for those of you who are not
 
03:04:14.590 --> 03:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with Choose Love it repres it's
 
03:04:17.309 --> 03:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
a very simple formula it represents
 
03:04:20.269 --> 03:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
courage gratitude forgiveness
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
compassion um and also uh most of you
 
03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
probably know that Governor Seno has
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
endorsed this amazing program in New
 
03:04:31.349 --> 03:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he actually has appointed
 
03:04:33.750 --> 03:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
the program manager who works in his
 
03:04:36.670 --> 03:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
office um and I that really resonates
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
with me um I use choose love in my
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
classroom every day um we start our day
 
03:04:44.550 --> 03:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
with our our morning meeting and I say
 
03:04:46.469 --> 03:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
good morning to every one of my students
 
03:04:49.750 --> 03:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
I look in their eyes and I say what are
 
03:04:52.990 --> 03:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
you grateful for today and I express my
 
03:04:56.349 --> 03:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
gratefulness it might be as simple as I
 
03:04:58.630 --> 03:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
was able to see the sunrise or something
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
like that and scientific research shows
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
that by expressing gratitude and this is
 
03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
just a fraction of this amazing program
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
it reduces anxiety and it just helps
 
03:05:14.190 --> 03:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
people be healthier and feel better I
 
03:05:17.389 --> 03:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
also want to express that when my all
 
03:05:20.110 --> 03:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
the tools like that little girl Express
 
03:05:22.190 --> 03:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
um when we take assessments some
 
03:05:25.750 --> 03:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
children are very anxious um and we take
 
03:05:32.670 --> 03:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
a breath and we calm our bodies so um I
 
03:05:38.429 --> 03:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
urge you to please o oppose this bill um
 
03:05:39.790 --> 03:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time thank
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%

3 years I am also here as a parent of a
 
03:06:25.030 --> 03:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
first grader and a fifth grader I could
 
03:06:27.030 --> 03:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
go into the research citing statistics
 
03:06:28.510 --> 03:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
showing that social emotional learning
 
03:06:30.269 --> 03:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
improves School attendance academic
 
03:06:33.389 --> 03:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
performance graduation rates Etc I could
 
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
talk about how when students are
 
03:06:36.990 --> 03:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing big feelings they're not
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
available for
 
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
instruction um other people have hit on
 
03:06:43.590 --> 03:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
those topics what I want to talk to you
 
03:06:45.630 --> 03:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
today about is what does this look like
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
in schools so you saw Cordelia who
 
03:06:51.990 --> 03:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
reported on the emotional ABCs that is
 
03:06:53.469 --> 03:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
one of the programs we're doing in
 
03:06:55.229 --> 03:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
addition to choose
 
03:06:59.389 --> 03:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
love this looks every day like students
 
03:07:02.229 --> 03:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
who are coming up to me telling me they
 
03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
were able to use their deep breathing
 
03:07:06.670 --> 03:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
they use their five senses to ground
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
their bodies so that they could retry
 
03:07:10.710 --> 03:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
that math
 
03:07:13.229 --> 03:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
problem it looks like kids on the
 
03:07:16.030 --> 03:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
playground using their words instead of
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
handson to solve who gets to be goalie
 
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
during soccer at
 
03:07:24.229 --> 03:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
recess this looks like students
 
03:07:26.670 --> 03:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
vocabulary for feelings growing from
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
just saying they're upset to being able
 
03:07:35.550 --> 03:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:37.870 --> 03:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
disappointed I've had students come into
 
03:07:41.710 --> 03:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
my office who initially were not able to
 
03:07:44.830 --> 03:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
name any ing strategies that they had to
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
calm big feelings now when I ask kids
 
03:07:50.630 --> 03:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
what's in your toolbox what strategies
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
do you have to deal with these big
 
03:07:55.229 --> 03:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
feelings students are at least able to
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
name three and that's not just name
 
03:07:59.870 --> 03:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
skills that they have learned this is
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
name naming skills that they actually
 
03:08:04.590 --> 03:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
can use successfully thank you for your
 
03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
time today thank you very much are there
 
03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:08:08.880 --> 03:08:09.910 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
represent

03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you could you just give us a
 
03:08:14.710 --> 03:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
couple of examples of the strategies
 
03:08:16.950 --> 03:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
sure um Cordelia talked about the five
 
03:08:19.750 --> 03:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
finger breathing we do so many different
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
breathing strategies hot cocoa breathing
 
03:08:26.190 --> 03:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
um we do the Choose Love Brave breath um
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
with the younger kids we might do bird
 
03:08:30.229 --> 03:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
breathing um where we incorporate the
 
03:08:33.910 --> 03:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
body into that um we also
 
03:08:37.469 --> 03:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
do the five senses where we will think
 
03:08:40.750 --> 03:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
about okay what are five things I see
 
03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
four things I hear um um three things I
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
feel you know two things I or one thing
 
03:08:48.990 --> 03:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
I can taste you know we go through all
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
the senses what can you think of for
 
03:08:53.870 --> 03:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
those things to help ground kids there's
 
03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
also we may kind of um shake out some of
 
03:09:02.510 --> 03:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
the feelings um we may do mindful
 
03:09:04.830 --> 03:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
activities like rainbow scavenger hunt
 
03:09:06.190 --> 03:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's a big one at our school where
 
03:09:08.750 --> 03:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
kids can sit in their seat and they look
 
03:09:11.269 --> 03:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
for something every color of the rainbow
 
03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't require them to get up
 
03:09:15.030 --> 03:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
out of their seat they can sit in their
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
seat they can find something every color
 
03:09:19.269 --> 03:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
it helps calm their bodies and then
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're ready to work we talk about
 
03:09:23.229 --> 03:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
taking pit stops where kids May
 
03:09:24.990 --> 03:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
recognize they need a drink of water
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
they may need to take a walk to the
 
03:09:30.229 --> 03:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
bathroom um none of this takes away from
 
03:09:32.910 --> 03:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
their time um and when you think about
 
03:09:34.349 --> 03:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
if they're grounded then they're
 
03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
available for instruction and that's not
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
taking away time thank you very much
 
03:09:40.349 --> 03:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you Mr chair
 
03:09:42.349 --> 03:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here and thank
 
03:09:43.990 --> 03:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
you for the work you do with your
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
students uh as a result of the program
 
03:09:48.030 --> 03:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
that you implemented there in the last
 
03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
three years have you seen uh a decrease
 
03:09:53.469 --> 03:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
in the discipline problems that you have
 
03:09:55.670 --> 03:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
in school we have I don't have the
 
03:09:58.269 --> 03:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
statistics on me but we
 
03:10:01.269 --> 03:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
have and when we do have kids that are
 
03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
having what we call bumps um they're
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
able to turn those bumps around more
 
03:10:08.510 --> 03:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
quickly so what could have been an
 
03:10:11.389 --> 03:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
episode where a kid was off for an hour
 
03:10:14.750 --> 03:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
we can now let them self- regulate maybe
 
03:10:16.469 --> 03:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
co-regulate with them where we sit down
 
03:10:17.630 --> 03:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
we do some deep breathing and they
 
03:10:19.389 --> 03:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
breathe with us and they're able to turn
 
03:10:21.309 --> 03:10:21.319 align:start position:0%
it around so much quicker within a
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
matter of a few minutes thank you thank
 
03:10:24.429 --> 03:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
you very much are there further
 
03:10:26.990 --> 03:10:27.000 align:start position:0%

teaching of resiliency and empathy I
 
03:12:06.750 --> 03:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
also want to note a concerning component
 
03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the original bill which is a ban on
 
03:12:11.389 --> 03:12:11.399 align:start position:0%

engagement for New Hampshire students

would deny our students the chance to
 
03:12:21.309 --> 03:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
develop into informed responsible and
 
03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:23.720 align:start position:0%

03:13:53.269 --> 03:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies in the testimony and then
 
03:13:55.670 --> 03:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
um luckily end a blast on the docket so
 
03:13:57.710 --> 03:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
I can try to address just a few of those
 
03:13:59.070 --> 03:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
very very
 
03:14:01.150 --> 03:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
quickly um I do have some written
 
03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that comes from our technical
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
assistance center which summarizes the
 
03:14:06.269 --> 03:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
literature and the evidence behind
 
03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning its
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
integration into Frameworks such as
 
03:14:11.990 --> 03:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
mtssb and I just would highly encourage
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
the committee to take a look at it
 
03:14:16.990 --> 03:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of um evidence talked
 
03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
about here and I want you to have the
 
03:14:19.750 --> 03:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
actual literature in your hands or
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
citations for the actual literature so
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
you can make informed decisions that are
 
03:14:24.110 --> 03:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
based on
 
03:14:26.429 --> 03:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
reality couple of very quick
 
03:14:27.950 --> 03:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
clarifications based on what I heard
 
03:14:30.590 --> 03:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
today that I think are important one is
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
I think we're having a confusion and a
 
03:14:34.910 --> 03:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
confabulation between social emotional
 
03:14:37.349 --> 03:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
learning curricula and social emotional
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
and behavioral screening social
 
03:14:41.910 --> 03:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
emotional curricula or curriculum their
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
curricula they're taught like any other
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
subject matter and often integrated into
 
03:14:48.269 --> 03:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
the academic curriculum which is
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
actually the most effective way the
 
03:14:52.950 --> 03:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
literature um shows to do that what it
 
03:14:56.990 --> 03:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
isn't is screening or surveys certainly
 
03:14:59.550 --> 03:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
schools can make a decision to have an
 
03:15:01.950 --> 03:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
adjunct survey or data collection tool
 
03:15:04.030 --> 03:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not an inherent part of
 
03:15:06.830 --> 03:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum a social emotional learning
 
03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum um I want to clarify that
 
03:15:12.070 --> 03:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
terms like mental health treatment um
 
03:15:14.830 --> 03:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
and assessment I would caution folks
 
03:15:17.790 --> 03:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
about using those terms in this context
 
03:15:20.269 --> 03:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
assessment is a as a psychologist is a
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
process of psychological um assessment
 
03:15:25.150 --> 03:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
using multiple tools by a qualified
 
03:15:27.429 --> 03:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
individual and that is not a part of
 
03:15:29.309 --> 03:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning curricula in
 
03:15:31.750 --> 03:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
schools if teachers are asked to
 
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
complete a survey or a rating scale to
 
03:15:38.110 --> 03:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
um provide information on student
 
03:15:41.309 --> 03:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
behavior and how students are doing um
 
03:15:44.030 --> 03:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
those are called screenings and they are
 
03:15:46.910 --> 03:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
based on observation not on
 
03:15:48.830 --> 03:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation that would be considered
 
03:15:50.750 --> 03:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
part of an assessment process because
 
03:15:52.269 --> 03:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
teachers are not qualified to do that
 
03:15:54.590 --> 03:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
and they're not asked to do that so just
 
03:15:56.309 --> 03:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
be careful when you hear those terms
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
assessment those are above and beyond
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I just want folks to be careful
 
03:16:03.630 --> 03:16:03.640 align:start position:0%
about that thank you very much your your
 
03:16:06.150 --> 03:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
time is up and yes we are familiar with
 
03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
mtssb yes I know I have talked to you
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
about it before thank you yes are there

can fill out a card but you can't speak
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
without the card okay I'll do that thank
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
you and you will be the last person

speaking thank
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:39.760 --> 03:16:41.269 align:start position:0%
 
card

03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
card
 
03:16:44.030 --> 03:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeah just let Marg know you're head it
 
03:16:49.469 --> 03:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:09.070 --> 03:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
different this is
 
03:17:11.199 --> 03:17:13.750 align:start position:0%
different this is
my

03:17:13.750 --> 03:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:26.670 --> 03:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
exactly you can fill that card out after
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
you've spoken we're trying to move on
 
03:17:28.960 --> 03:17:41.189 align:start position:0%
you've spoken we're trying to move on
here

03:17:41.189 --> 03:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.199 --> 03:17:45.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:47.349 --> 03:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
grie Phillips Bristol New Hampshire
 
03:17:49.870 --> 03:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity uh what
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm motivated to speak is
 
03:17:52.750 --> 03:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
because with all the conversation I've
 
03:17:56.429 --> 03:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
heard today many of us agree with 95%
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
plus of all these concerns over good
 
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
counseling for children as an employer I
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
had people work with me who had
 
03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I always accommodated
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
that as an employer and got good
 
03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
successful results with them those are
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
my qualifications as I speak I think the
 
03:18:13.710 --> 03:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
one key issue that's not adequately been
 
03:18:16.950 --> 03:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
addressed is this it because cell does
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
implement a broad brush approach the on
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
problem the problem lies in the areas of
 
03:18:25.630 --> 03:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that the tentacles of cell are
 
03:18:28.150 --> 03:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
in everything that opens a door for
 
03:18:30.349 --> 03:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
teachers counselors and others to go
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
ahead and indoctrinate children and and
 
03:18:39.590 --> 03:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
and in uh re uh values that may be
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
contrary to those of the parent um when
 
03:18:44.710 --> 03:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
it comes to addressing the emotional
 
03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
social needs of students I think the
 
03:18:48.630 --> 03:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
best approach and a lot of us feel this
 
03:18:51.870 --> 03:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
way is to go ahead and have teacher and
 
03:18:55.349 --> 03:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
counselor trainings in the these two
 
03:18:58.910 --> 03:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
areas disability
 
03:19:02.790 --> 03:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
detection that uh hinders effective
 
03:19:04.510 --> 03:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
learning so that accommodation can be
 
03:19:07.269 --> 03:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
made through IEPs and number two
 
03:19:10.269 --> 03:19:10.279 align:start position:0%
detection of emotional disturbances that
 
03:19:12.790 --> 03:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
would be severe enough to to prevent
 
03:19:15.630 --> 03:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
successful learning this broad brush
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
brush approach opens the door for
 
03:19:20.910 --> 03:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities of indoctrinations that
 
03:19:23.349 --> 03:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
usurp the rights of
 
03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
parents you can go ahead and cite how it
 
03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
is that cell programs have improved
 
03:19:32.150 --> 03:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
academic learning but any peer review
 
03:19:34.469 --> 03:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
would go ahead and say well wait just a
 
03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
minute here you're talking about
 
03:19:39.870 --> 03:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement of Education among a limited
 
03:19:43.710 --> 03:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
specialized population who are needy and
 
03:19:46.030 --> 03:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of that population should not
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
in any way effective learning
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
across the board specialized counseling
 
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
after the your time is up thank you very
 
03:19:57.710 --> 03:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much other questions
 
03:20:00.229 --> 03:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing any uh we
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee we do have a number of bills
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
and we're falling behind I I believe
 
03:20:18.750 --> 03:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
what we can do here is that there are
 
03:20:21.229 --> 03:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
some folks that came for 1625 they're
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
waiting in the hallway I'm going to go
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
ahead and open that up and take
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
testimony if but if there are those
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
right here that's a bill that just makes
 
03:20:34.030 --> 03:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know a very simple change here in
 
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
the bill so we'll hear that one and then
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a break but if you
 
03:20:43.630 --> 03:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
want to take your break now go ahead
 
03:20:45.950 --> 03:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 
03:20:53.150 --> 03:20:53.160 align:start position:0%

Durkin from ASI Council 93 here to
 
03:22:54.510 --> 03:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
express our support for House Bill
 
03:22:57.189 --> 03:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
1625 legislation aimed at helping school
 
03:22:59.030 --> 03:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
districts continue to address the
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
problem of filling a high number of
 
03:23:02.670 --> 03:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
vacant school nurse positions in our
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we made great progress in
 
03:23:07.150 --> 03:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
addressing this shortage in the previous
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
legisl uh legislative session through
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
the passage of Senate Bill 215 which
 
03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
reduce the minimum education
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
requirements for a school nurse from a
 
03:23:18.590 --> 03:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
4-year degree to a 2-year degree that
 
03:23:20.429 --> 03:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
legislation which enjoyed strong
 
03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support was signed into law
 
03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
by governor sonunu and has helped cities
 
03:23:26.670 --> 03:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
like Manchester attract new applicants
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
to these positions but a shortage still
 
03:23:31.189 --> 03:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
exists we believe this bill would build
 
03:23:32.990 --> 03:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
on the progress achieved in the previous
 
03:23:34.990 --> 03:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
session by removing yet another barrier
 
03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
for district seeking to attract
 
03:23:39.150 --> 03:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
qualified nurses quite simply the bill
 
03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
removes the requirement for School
 
03:23:42.189 --> 03:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
nurses to be certified IED by the
 
03:23:43.910 --> 03:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
department of Ved and transfer is the
 
03:23:46.349 --> 03:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility where we and sponsors of
 
03:23:48.189 --> 03:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation believe it belongs with
 
03:23:50.950 --> 03:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Nursing indeed the uh
 
03:23:52.990 --> 03:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
Board of Education also agreed in fact
 
03:23:55.710 --> 03:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
that the hearing on the aformentioned uh
 
03:23:58.710 --> 03:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
Bill nearly one year ago to the day uh
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the State Board of Ed
 
03:24:02.510 --> 03:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
stated and I'm I'm paraphrasing here but
 
03:24:04.349 --> 03:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
stated that the board would prefer to
 
03:24:05.750 --> 03:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
leave the responsibility of
 
03:24:08.630 --> 03:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
certification to the board of nursing uh
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
one of our as me School nurses working
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
in Manchester Mr Patricia rangin has
 
03:24:14.710 --> 03:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony which talks
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
about this in much greater detail I have
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
printed copies for the committee uh so I
 
03:24:21.710 --> 03:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
won't elaborate any further uh as she
 
03:24:23.349 --> 03:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
covers this point quite well I'll just
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
close with one key Point Mr chairman a
 
03:24:28.189 --> 03:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
number of vacancies still exist in our
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
schools and now perhaps more than ever
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
we need our school staffed with
 
03:24:33.990 --> 03:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
qualified nurses the needs of our
 
03:24:35.710 --> 03:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
children and teens in our high schools
 
03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
are drastically different than the days
 
03:24:40.269 --> 03:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
when I and probably a lot of p uh people
 
03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
on this committee uh were students uh
 
03:24:44.830 --> 03:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with the problems of
 
03:24:46.950 --> 03:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
things like childhood obesity alone kids
 
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
and teens are dealing with more complex
 
03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
health issues such as diabetes high
 
03:24:53.469 --> 03:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
blood pressure or even food allergies
 
03:24:55.469 --> 03:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
many are taking medication on a daily
 
03:24:58.670 --> 03:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
basis time is up thank you is that all
 
03:25:00.309 --> 03:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
written testimony that you have we could
 
03:25:02.309 --> 03:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
put that right into the record and get
 
03:25:04.750 --> 03:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes i' I I've got a couple of copies
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
here for you Mr German um again this is
 
03:25:11.229 --> 03:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
just build on progress and we appreciate
 
03:25:14.110 --> 03:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the the legislation very much
 
03:25:15.790 --> 03:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much I'm sorry
 
03:25:17.710 --> 03:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
I have I do my best to answer questions
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
if the committee has any questions yes
 
03:25:23.309 --> 03:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner um I somehow I thanks
 
03:25:25.630 --> 03:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I missed do you
 
03:25:27.229 --> 03:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
represent a school district and does
 
03:25:29.910 --> 03:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
that school district have nurses that
 
03:25:31.950 --> 03:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
are certified through this State
 
03:25:35.229 --> 03:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education yes uh we've got
 
03:25:37.590 --> 03:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
about 4,000 uh members here in New
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but one of our biggest locals
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
is in Manchester where there's uh right
 
03:25:44.710 --> 03:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
now I think there's 26 positions in
 
03:25:47.389 --> 03:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester um they were able to fill
 
03:25:48.790 --> 03:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
with that legislation I mentioned
 
03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
earlier they were able to fill three of
 
03:25:53.030 --> 03:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
them last year but those were for
 
03:25:55.469 --> 03:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
retiring nurses so we're essentially
 
03:25:57.750 --> 03:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
just Treading Water there uh there's
 
03:25:59.950 --> 03:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
currently nine vacant positions in
 
03:26:02.269 --> 03:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester those are staffed by a
 
03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
revolving pool of contract nurses uh
 
03:26:07.590 --> 03:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
from an agency which is is quite
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
expensive um and also you know you have
 
03:26:12.269 --> 03:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
the problem where
 
03:26:13.830 --> 03:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
they don't know the kids they don't get
 
03:26:15.750 --> 03:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
a chance to know the kids like people
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
who are permanently stationed in the
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
school know their individual needs their
 
03:26:21.550 --> 03:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
their medical needs things like that so
 
03:26:24.269 --> 03:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
just to qualify you're a union yes
 
03:26:27.349 --> 03:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
ma'am which Union do you represent uh
 
03:26:29.349 --> 03:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
American Federation of state county and
 
03:26:32.750 --> 03:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees thank you thank you
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
03:26:38.469 --> 03:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
03:26:43.030 --> 03:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
question what purpose does the
 
03:26:45.389 --> 03:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
certification by the depart I mean what
 
03:26:48.030 --> 03:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
does the Department of Education ask of
 
03:26:51.189 --> 03:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
a nurse that wouldn't have been asked by
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
a nursing organization uh it's it's a
 
03:26:58.349 --> 03:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
very good question uh I'm not quite sure
 
03:27:01.229 --> 03:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
I do know that like any kind of uh
 
03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
process it is cumbersome they go through
 
03:27:06.110 --> 03:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
a background check just like they the a
 
03:27:08.030 --> 03:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the same things that are done by
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
the the Board of Nursing to certify well
 
03:27:13.189 --> 03:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
we think this would be particularly
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
helpful is right now you've got this
 
03:27:18.189 --> 03:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
shortage of of of nursing so a lot of a
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
lot of school districts are kind of
 
03:27:21.389 --> 03:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
stealing from each other for lack of a
 
03:27:23.550 --> 03:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
better term because you've got to have
 
03:27:25.750 --> 03:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that department of Ed
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
certification uh in order to go into a
 
03:27:30.110 --> 03:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
school district what this would do would
 
03:27:32.429 --> 03:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
be to allow people allow districts to
 
03:27:34.389 --> 03:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
hire people directly from the private
 
03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
sector they could start right away and
 
03:27:38.590 --> 03:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
not have to begin the certification
 
03:27:41.030 --> 03:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
process uh through the department thank
 
03:27:43.429 --> 03:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
you for committee not seeing thank you
 
03:27:48.269 --> 03:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:54.349 --> 03:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.550 --> 03:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
Association thank you chairman mad
 
03:27:58.950 --> 03:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Pam Denley um I'm a
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
school nurse and um I teach in the
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
school of nursing Masters program at um
 
03:28:08.229 --> 03:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
elm's college and I live in Manchester
 
03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
the nurse the New Hampshire Nurses
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
Association supports our affiliate the
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school nurse Association
 
03:28:17.469 --> 03:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
in opposing HB 1625 relevant to school
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
nurse certification I did just want to
 
03:28:21.150 --> 03:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
clarify that there's a difference
 
03:28:23.710 --> 03:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
between certification and lure So
 
03:28:25.990 --> 03:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
currently the nurses are licensed by the
 
03:28:27.870 --> 03:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing and certified by the
 
03:28:30.550 --> 03:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um as nurses
 
03:28:32.030 --> 03:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
were disappointed at the attempt to
 
03:28:34.110 --> 03:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
further discredit School nurses the
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of certification is to improve
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
the nurses ability to provide the best
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
patient care to our schoolage children
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
and to demonst at the commitment they
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
have to the specialty nursing practice
 
03:28:46.910 --> 03:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
School nurses are often the only health
 
03:28:49.229 --> 03:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
professional in the school and practice
 
03:28:51.950 --> 03:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
autonomously in that role as you aware
 
03:28:53.150 --> 03:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
children in our schools have
 
03:28:55.229 --> 03:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
increasingly complex medical needs and
 
03:28:57.309 --> 03:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
mental health issues requiring the nurse
 
03:28:59.670 --> 03:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
to assess diagnose and treat as many as
 
03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
55 children in a single day in my own
 
03:29:04.710 --> 03:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
journey to be a school nurse I've had to
 
03:29:04.720 --> 03:29:08.150 align:start position:0%
journey to be a school nurse I've had to
often

03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:11.469 --> 03:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
uh substantiate why I want to be school
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
nurse based on my education and I think
 
03:29:17.590 --> 03:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
that um what the certification process
 
03:29:19.830 --> 03:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
does is allow our employers to know that
 
03:29:22.910 --> 03:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
they have quality nurses in their
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
schools um it's one of the most
 
03:29:26.670 --> 03:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
challenging things I've ever done in my
 
03:29:29.389 --> 03:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
career to be a school nurse um many of
 
03:29:32.110 --> 03:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
my students I taught at UNH for 20 years
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
I had all my students rotate through
 
03:29:35.469 --> 03:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
School nurses and they would all come
 
03:29:38.670 --> 03:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
back and say to me I've never had such a
 
03:29:41.150 --> 03:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh respect for the quality and the and
 
03:29:44.349 --> 03:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
the skill of a school nurse so um I
 
03:29:46.189 --> 03:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
think that it's really important to
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
understand what certification
 
03:29:49.950 --> 03:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrates and that's the ability for
 
03:29:52.590 --> 03:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
nurses to provide excellent and
 
03:29:55.590 --> 03:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
experienced clinical Care thank you are
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
there questions yes representative
 
03:29:58.830 --> 03:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
pedell thank you and thank you for
 
03:30:01.790 --> 03:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I understand what
 
03:30:05.070 --> 03:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying about nurses you know
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
being certified and it's important to be
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
educated and how to care for children in
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
the school is there a separate
 
03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
professional certification that you a
 
03:30:15.040 --> 03:30:16.030 align:start position:0%
professional certification that you a
nurse

03:30:16.030 --> 03:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
03:30:18.189 --> 03:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
could there's there's a national
 
03:30:19.950 --> 03:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
certification so this is actually a
 
03:30:22.030 --> 03:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
state certification so many of our I I
 
03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
work in Manchester many of our
 
03:30:24.790 --> 03:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester nurses are actually
 
03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
nationally School certified so that's a
 
03:30:30.870 --> 03:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
really uous process and um it would be
 
03:30:32.910 --> 03:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
the most respected certification for our
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
profession but it's at at this time a
 
03:30:38.670 --> 03:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
lot of people find it really a barrier
 
03:30:40.510 --> 03:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
so this this school nurse certification
 
03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about was the doe you
 
03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
have to have years of experience and you
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
have to have a certain amount of
 
03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
continuing education specific to working
 
03:30:49.750 --> 03:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
in a school environment so that's why
 
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's really valuable to New
 
03:30:53.910 --> 03:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Tanner and then
 
03:30:55.750 --> 03:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you thank you for
 
03:30:58.830 --> 03:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I believe before
 
03:31:01.550 --> 03:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
we actually had a a school nurse
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
specialist at the Department of
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
Education yeah um do you know if that
 
03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
position has ever been filled it's never
 
03:31:10.150 --> 03:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
been filled represent Miler thank you Mr
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here I this is
 
03:31:15.950 --> 03:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
not a new issue for this committee no uh
 
03:31:18.830 --> 03:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
so we've got a lot of new people on this
 
03:31:22.110 --> 03:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
committee could you please specifically
 
03:31:24.349 --> 03:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
talk about the difference of
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
lure versus
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
certification and what would be the
 
03:31:31.110 --> 03:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
impact of if this particular piece of
 
03:31:34.189 --> 03:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
legislation were to become law right so
 
03:31:37.189 --> 03:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh a nurse of graduate from a a nursing
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
school an accredited nursing school so
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
they would either receive their
 
03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
associate degree or or their bachelor's
 
03:31:43.550 --> 03:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
degree then we take What's called the
 
03:31:46.110 --> 03:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
enlex exam which is a it's the um
 
03:31:48.030 --> 03:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
National exam and you become a
 
03:31:50.349 --> 03:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
registered nurse so what this committee
 
03:31:52.189 --> 03:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
did last year was to say what the
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
certification requirement used to be you
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
had to have you had to have a BSN to be
 
03:31:59.790 --> 03:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
a school nurse and then then be
 
03:32:01.990 --> 03:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
certified what this committee did last
 
03:32:03.950 --> 03:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
year was to say you could start as an
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
associate degree nurse which is a 2-year
 
03:32:08.710 --> 03:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
degree but had to be working towards
 
03:32:10.189 --> 03:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
your bachelor's degree towards
 
03:32:14.269 --> 03:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
certification within 6 years so that's
 
03:32:17.110 --> 03:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
the that's the lure so any anybody who
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
calls thems a registered nurse has a
 
03:32:20.830 --> 03:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
license through the National Council of
 
03:32:24.269 --> 03:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
State Boards of Nursing in in this bill
 
03:32:27.110 --> 03:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
the certification for a school nurse is
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
um continuing education specific to
 
03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
school nursing and um working towards
 
03:32:36.309 --> 03:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
your bachelor's degree so you have to
 
03:32:38.550 --> 03:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
have your what this what this body did
 
03:32:40.510 --> 03:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
last year was to say that within 6 years
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
you have to have your bachelor's degree
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
so you essentially have six years to
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
work towards certification and this bill
 
03:32:49.389 --> 03:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
would disallow that then right so what
 
03:32:51.469 --> 03:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
this bill so so the confusion I think is
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
to say well it's already in the board of
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
nursing which it's not the board of
 
03:32:57.790 --> 03:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
nursing licenses all nursing they
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
certify some they certify nurse
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
Educators they certify Advanced
 
03:33:03.349 --> 03:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
registered nurse practitioners they
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
certify nurse anesthetist this bill or
 
03:33:08.590 --> 03:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
this certification is through the
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and specific
 
03:33:13.150 --> 03:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
spefically because nurses School nurses
 
03:33:15.229 --> 03:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
work in schools and they have to have a
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
certain amount of Education around
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
working in a school like what is a 504
 
03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
plan what is an IEP so that's sort of
 
03:33:24.309 --> 03:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
specialty education that you have to be
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
successful in your role thank you very
 
03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
much further questions from the
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
Wells

03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:44.830 --> 03:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um and committee
 
03:33:47.790 --> 03:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
members it's nice to be here um my name
 
03:33:50.830 --> 03:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
is Nancy Wells I am uh the Lea for the
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school Nurses Association
 
03:33:55.550 --> 03:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I am the former um school nurse
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator with the Department of
 
03:33:59.469 --> 03:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
Education that position is not is that
 
03:34:01.790 --> 03:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
is not filled at the moment I'm here to
 
03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
object to House Bill
 
03:34:07.110 --> 03:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
1625 and I remain committed to the
 
03:34:09.389 --> 03:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
necessity and the Integrity of the
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
school nurse certification that we have
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
just to give you a quick um picture of
 
03:34:16.990 --> 03:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
why we came up with certification the
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education previously had
 
03:34:21.070 --> 03:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
required certification of School nurses
 
03:34:26.189 --> 03:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
with our RSA 229 since 2016 we've met
 
03:34:28.750 --> 03:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
several times and we've added extra time
 
03:34:30.790 --> 03:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
for people to get the necessary
 
03:34:33.550 --> 03:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
education or training that to make it so
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
that they would meet the qualifications
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
for certification as a quality and
 
03:34:41.070 --> 03:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
professional school nurse in the past
 
03:34:43.150 --> 03:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
School administrators and the Educators
 
03:34:45.389 --> 03:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
and parents had made complaints to the
 
03:34:48.030 --> 03:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
doe about issues with uh regarding
 
03:34:49.750 --> 03:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
School nurses not following School
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
protocols not buying into the school
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
framework and certainly not providing
 
03:34:55.710 --> 03:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
basic nursing care that was very
 
03:34:58.189 --> 03:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
upsetting to a lot of us um the former
 
03:35:00.030 --> 03:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education met with
 
03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
myself and several of the New Hampshire
 
03:35:03.070 --> 03:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
school nurse
 
03:35:05.349 --> 03:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
leaders and we identified the need for
 
03:35:07.389 --> 03:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
more Education and Training for a nurse
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
to function in the specialty practice of
 
03:35:11.229 --> 03:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
nursing school nursing
 
03:35:12.830 --> 03:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
we work with the Department of Ed and
 
03:35:15.070 --> 03:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
the surrounding states um who also
 
03:35:17.550 --> 03:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
require state certification as well as
 
03:35:18.910 --> 03:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
the National Association of School
 
03:35:21.389 --> 03:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
nurses to identify those specific areas
 
03:35:23.590 --> 03:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
needed for practice and that became the
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
basis of what we require for
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
certification um I don't have to tell
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
you how complicated our Pro our practice
 
03:35:33.150 --> 03:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
is right now with um certainly students
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
with anaphylaxis with asthma esthesia
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
disorders those students who are
 
03:35:39.189 --> 03:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
homeless students who don't speak
 
03:35:40.550 --> 03:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
English as their primary language
 
03:35:42.790 --> 03:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
anguage um as well as the multiple

03:36:24.990 --> 03:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
question would you know if a district is
 
03:36:27.590 --> 03:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
using contract nurses because they have
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%

03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
positions are those contract nurses
 
03:36:34.349 --> 03:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
certified through Department of Ed I
 
03:36:36.550 --> 03:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't think so um but I will tell you
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
that there's uh across the state there's
 
03:36:40.830 --> 03:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
one open position in school Nur nursing
 
03:36:40.840 --> 03:36:42.510 align:start position:0%
one open position in school Nur nursing
right

03:36:42.510 --> 03:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
now that's different information than we
 
03:36:47.469 --> 03:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
heard a few minutes ago I
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
know F the question represent M thank
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
you for being here could you clarify I
 
03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
mean isn't a nurse a nurse I what what
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
what what what's the certification
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
needed to be a school nurse rather than
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
a regular nurse I think when we we talk
 
03:37:07.469 --> 03:37:07.479 align:start position:0%
about school nursing a school nurse must
 
03:37:09.550 --> 03:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
be able to work as an inter
 
03:37:12.110 --> 03:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary team we need to know
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
what the school psychologists do what
 
03:37:15.389 --> 03:37:15.399 align:start position:0%
the social workers do what the teachers
 
03:37:18.510 --> 03:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
do we need to U make sure that we can
 
03:37:21.150 --> 03:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
understand um what the goals of being in
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
school are um that's different than what
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
I would do as a as a nurse uh for my
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
patient in the hospital um because there
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
I can control what is happening with
 
03:37:33.389 --> 03:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
them what kind of medications I can give
 
03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%

um what the education goals are so it's
 
03:37:48.389 --> 03:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
a really a lot more of pulling together
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
a lot more resources to become um make
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%

confused because we just had somebody
 
03:38:08.550 --> 03:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
from the um abma labor union who said
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
that in Manchester uh they were having a
 
03:38:14.189 --> 03:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
great deal of difficulty getting uh
 
03:38:17.189 --> 03:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
nurses for the schools and yet you said
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
that there's only one open position
 
03:38:22.030 --> 03:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
could you clarify how that meshes
 
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:24.920 align:start position:0%

03:38:28.910 --> 03:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
school in Manchester um and they fill
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
them with with agency nurses I don't
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%

03:38:36.750 --> 03:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
is not fulfilling with School nurses
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
regular School nurses that are certified
 
03:38:40.750 --> 03:38:40.760 align:start position:0%

have that information provided to us
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%

03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
also we'll take that written testim oh
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right yeah you can have the
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
written testimony I'm just is going to
 
03:42:44.670 --> 03:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
say that I am you know uh opposed to the
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
1625 um bill and I think the
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
certification still needs to stand for
 
03:42:54.070 --> 03:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
03:42:56.030 --> 03:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:42:56.040 --> 03:42:57.189 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
represent

03:42:57.189 --> 03:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:42:59.870 --> 03:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
Damon two straightforward questions
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here can you tell us
 
03:43:04.469 --> 03:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
what the cost of certification is and
 
03:43:06.110 --> 03:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
could you also give us any information
 
03:43:07.309 --> 03:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
about whether other states have a
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
similar certification requirement it is
 
03:43:13.070 --> 03:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
is I do believe still at $75 for the
 
03:43:13.080 --> 03:43:15.389 align:start position:0%
is I do believe still at $75 for the
three-year

03:43:15.389 --> 03:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
three-year
 
03:43:18.670 --> 03:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
certification and there are other states
 
03:43:19.710 --> 03:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't have them off the top of
 
03:43:21.389 --> 03:43:21.399 align:start position:0%
my head but I know like say in Rhode
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
Island they are school nurse teachers
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
along with they do this whole teacher
 
03:43:27.870 --> 03:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
certification along with being the
 
03:43:30.110 --> 03:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
registered nurse and
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has last I knew they were
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
at the Master's level for school I mean
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
School nursing is very independent very
 
03:43:40.750 --> 03:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
much you have to be able to be a leader
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the field of nursing to really
 
03:43:46.070 --> 03:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
be things that need to happen within
 
03:43:48.510 --> 03:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
today's um Healthcare and school the
 
03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
education set thank you very much
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
reminder to the committee here that when
 
03:43:55.229 --> 03:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
we certify through the department we're
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
also having to work for through the
 
03:43:58.830 --> 03:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
department of safety there is a fee for
 
03:44:01.229 --> 03:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
certification which the department
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
charges and then on top of that you have
 
03:44:06.750 --> 03:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
safety as well so it is over $100 total
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
comes out closer we found little around
 
03:44:12.670 --> 03:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
140 some odd the other day with another
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%

04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
1298 um we have discussed we've seen
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
articles um all year on the teacher
 
04:29:36.870 --> 04:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
shortages um
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
in many areas special
 
04:29:43.870 --> 04:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
education um some Specialties in terms
 
04:29:46.590 --> 04:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
of um speech and and
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
reading um and this is um another
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to try and help with that
 
04:29:59.830 --> 04:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
shortage uh and we termed it part-time
 
04:30:02.910 --> 04:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
teachers and that um they would be
 
04:30:06.750 --> 04:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
working less than 30 hours per week
 
04:30:10.109 --> 04:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
um they would have some kind of
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
expertise or professional experience in
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
the subject area that they are assigned
 
04:30:17.309 --> 04:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
to uh teach
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
in um they would go through the normal
 
04:30:23.229 --> 04:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
records criminal records background
 
04:30:26.550 --> 04:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
checks um and they would also be
 
04:30:30.269 --> 04:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
overseen um uh mentored by uh a
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
supervising teacher if you will uh to um
 
04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:42.149 --> 04:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
um we do indicate also that if they have
 
04:30:45.630 --> 04:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
had their credential um
 
04:30:47.790 --> 04:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
revoked um that they would not be
 
04:30:51.070 --> 04:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
eligible for such a position uh but I
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
think that this is one small step we can
 
04:30:58.990 --> 04:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
take with the um with the teacher
 
04:30:59.000 --> 04:31:00.710 align:start position:0%
take with the um with the teacher
shortage

04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
04:31:03.630 --> 04:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
um how long that teacher shortage will
 
04:31:05.790 --> 04:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
last and in what subject areas we don't
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
know but I think that this will help um
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the short term uh certainly um with
 
04:31:12.239 --> 04:31:13.030 align:start position:0%
in the short term uh certainly um with
that

04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
shortage and I thank you thank you very
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%

04:31:41.790 --> 04:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman laad members of
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
the House Education committee uh I'm
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the members of the
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teachers New
 
04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to speak in opposition to
 
04:31:53.309 --> 04:31:53.319 align:start position:0%
HB 1298 I do appreciate the attempt to
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
find a creative solution to the teacher
 
04:31:58.349 --> 04:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
shortage we have in this state and many
 
04:32:00.510 --> 04:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
places in the country but um I want to
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
say that this is not the way to go about
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
it um it would not be in the best
 
04:32:06.189 --> 04:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
interest of our public uh school
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
students and it
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
would overburden already overburden
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
full-time staff teaching is not just a
 
04:32:16.990 --> 04:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
matter of knowing your content area so
 
04:32:19.910 --> 04:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
limiting this to just individuals who
 
04:32:22.030 --> 04:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
have specialized knowledge coming in
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
from another field um does not solve the
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
concern we have with it to be a teacher
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
you need not only knowledge of a Content
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
area you need to know about Learners and
 
04:32:34.830 --> 04:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
how they learn you need to know about
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
child devel velopment or adolescent
 
04:32:38.790 --> 04:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
development uni classroom management
 
04:32:42.030 --> 04:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
skills being a credential teacher means
 
04:32:45.309 --> 04:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
that youve had at least an exposure or
 
04:32:47.109 --> 04:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh had a chance to develop an
 
04:32:49.630 --> 04:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of all that in your um
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
college preparatory course when you
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
became a teacher and in your student
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
teaching and practicums um and as you
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
are um a teacher when you go to
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
recertify you you have to show that
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
you're doing ongoing professional
 
04:33:04.109 --> 04:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
development to keep up with uh new
 
04:33:06.789 --> 04:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
developments in the field
 
04:33:11.310 --> 04:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
um let's see you know you you um just
 
04:33:13.230 --> 04:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
because you are very good at a
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
particular field say coding in um
 
04:33:18.910 --> 04:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
computers does not mean that you know
 
04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
how to manage a classroom full of
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
students and it also does not mean that
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
you have the correct temperament not to
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
get drawn into a battle of wills with a
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
seventh grader who doesn't want to
 
04:33:31.029 --> 04:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
listen and doesn't want to do the work
 
04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
it could be a really bad setup for the
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
student students and end up in a bad
 
04:33:39.789 --> 04:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
outcome um the idea that full-time
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
teaching teaching staff will just
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
Mentor part-time uncertified employees

who get hired as
 
04:33:48.039 --> 04:33:49.869 align:start position:0%
who get hired as
teachers

04:33:49.869 --> 04:33:49.879 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
is a a bad um idea it there there's
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that explains how that's
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to work you're adding more work to
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
people who are already so overworked
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
that many of them are considering
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
whether they want to stay in teaching so
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
please don't put more on their plates
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
it'll be bad for the students because
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
the teachers are already so
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
overburdened that they're having a hard
 
04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
time doing everything they need to do in
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
our under resource public schools to
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
meet their current students needs never
 
04:34:25.629 --> 04:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
mind supervising another
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
uncertified employee without the support
 
04:34:31.949 --> 04:34:31.959 align:start position:0%
you would get from um a college Pro a
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
teacher prep program if it were a normal
 
04:34:36.150 --> 04:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
student teaching
 
04:34:41.109 --> 04:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
experience um and by the way putting a
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
full-time teacher in a supervisory
 
04:34:46.349 --> 04:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
position over an uncertified staff that
 
04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
you've hired as teacher um is probably
 
04:34:51.150 --> 04:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
in violation of all of our Collective
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
baring agreements around the state so
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
for those reasons we are opposing HB
 
04:34:59.070 --> 04:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
1298 and thank you for your time thank
 
04:35:01.150 --> 04:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions from
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
the committee not seeing thank you very
 
04:35:19.150 --> 04:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.551 --> 04:35:21.561 align:start position:0%
Tuttle good afternoon thank you chairman
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
lad members of the House Education
 
04:35:24.349 --> 04:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record I'm Megan
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
tutle president for Nea New Hampshire
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
representing about 17,000 Educators
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
across the state um just like Deb we're
 
04:35:33.070 --> 04:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
also here in opposition to House Bill
 
04:35:35.629 --> 04:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
1298 uh relative to the definition of
 
04:35:38.551 --> 04:35:38.561 align:start position:0%
part-time teachers there's other avenues
 
04:35:40.590 --> 04:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
that we can use to help ensure there's
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
adequate quality educated um educator
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
personel who are certified if you look
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
back at the educator shortage committee
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
report that came out um at the end of
 
04:35:50.750 --> 04:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
the summer this fall nowhere in there
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
did it mention this approach of having a
 
04:35:54.990 --> 04:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
part-time teacher the way the bill is
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
written makes it seem like because a
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
teacher doesn't engage in full-time
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
teaching activities they don't need the
 
04:36:02.029 --> 04:36:02.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate credentials to engage in
 
04:36:04.029 --> 04:36:04.039 align:start position:0%
teaching the question isn't really the
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time and a person engages in
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
teaching activities but rather a
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
question of wanting to ensure that the
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
person who works in the capacity of a
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
teacher has the Knowledge and Skills to
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
do so effectively licensing by the state
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
is one of the ways that citizens can be
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
assured that the person does have that
 
04:36:21.429 --> 04:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
re requisite knowledge and skill
 
04:36:22.830 --> 04:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
applying the Bill's logic to other
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
professions just really shows the
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
fallacy of the Bill's Logic for example
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
if a surgeon performs surgery on a
 
04:36:30.429 --> 04:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
part-time basis should that surgeon be
 
04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
licensed if a psychiatrist only sees
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
patients on a part-time basis should
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
that psychiatrist have a license to
 
04:36:37.949 --> 04:36:37.959 align:start position:0%
practice putting people into teaching
 
04:36:39.390 --> 04:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
positions without the requisite
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
Knowledge and Skills will not end up
 
04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
helping students and these people are
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
more likely to leave the job and the
 
04:36:46.510 --> 04:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
profession sooner this has been shown in
 
04:36:48.269 --> 04:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
studies was testified to in the teacher
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
shortage committee by superintendant as
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
well we already have a one-year
 
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
Certificate of Eligibility that is
 
04:36:55.109 --> 04:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
available to local school districts
 
04:36:56.230 --> 04:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
should they need it and which the
 
04:36:58.230 --> 04:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislature just recently added a
 
04:37:00.029 --> 04:37:00.039 align:start position:0%
one-year extension to in the 2023
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
session we also have alternative
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
certification Pathways so this bill to
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
us seems really unnecessary paragraph
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
three of the bill States the local
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
school shall appoint a supervising
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
teacher to oversee and participate in EV
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
evaluation of each part-time teacher's
 
04:37:14.029 --> 04:37:14.039 align:start position:0%
work and
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness what are the
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
qualifications of that supervising
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
teacher can they be another part-time
 
04:37:20.269 --> 04:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
teacher will they be compensated with
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
shortages do they even have time or do
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
we have people willing to do this what
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
is involved in the overseeing and the
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
evaluation and again as you know debb
 
04:37:29.910 --> 04:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um there are employment
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
Provisions covered under cvas one last
 
04:37:33.869 --> 04:37:33.879 align:start position:0%
thing for the code of conduct we're
 
04:37:34.990 --> 04:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
wondering how the code of conduct
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
conduct would be enforced on a part-time
 
04:37:38.830 --> 04:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
teacher is the department suggesting
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
that they take action on someone that
 
04:37:42.429 --> 04:37:42.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a certification and how
 
04:37:43.949 --> 04:37:43.959 align:start position:0%
would the department do what is claimed
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
as necessary before this committee
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
numerous times prevent someone who
 
04:37:48.590 --> 04:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
violates the code at one school from
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
being hired at another because under
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
this that person is not required to hold
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
a license that the state board can
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
suspend or revoke so instead of this
 
04:37:57.750 --> 04:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
approach the instead of the approach
 
04:37:59.789 --> 04:37:59.799 align:start position:0%
this bill takes we need to be focusing
 
04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
on helping school districts raise pay
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
invest in teacher Recruitment and
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
training improving working conditions
 
04:38:06.990 --> 04:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
for school staff and that can increase
 
04:38:08.349 --> 04:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
the numbers and diversity of fully
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
prepared teachers and Par professionals
 
04:38:11.709 --> 04:38:11.719 align:start position:0%
as well as working with pre-service
 
04:38:13.629 --> 04:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
educator programs and programs like
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%

boards Association uh thanks for the
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today we
 
04:38:50.189 --> 04:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate the intent of
 
04:38:52.590 --> 04:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
trying to work towards solutions to fill
 
04:38:54.310 --> 04:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
positions that are of critical need in
 
04:38:56.670 --> 04:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
the state however we are opposed to this
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
bill uh we certainly we have a
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
resolution which focuses on supporting
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that intends to streamline
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
recruiting credentialing and hiring but
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
of certified staff not of uncertified
 
04:39:10.109 --> 04:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
Staff as you've heard by several people
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
prior to me uh there are opportunities
 
04:39:14.709 --> 04:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
and Pathways for people to take if they
 
04:39:17.629 --> 04:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
would like to become a certified teacher
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
um or an educator in the state we share
 
04:39:22.269 --> 04:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
the concerns about what happens if
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
somebody violates the code of conduct
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
while we appreciate that this bill tries
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
to wrap these part-time teachers under
 
04:39:30.029 --> 04:39:30.039 align:start position:0%
that umbrella I'm not sure what is being
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
suspended or taken away if the only um
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
thing that currently can be suspended or
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
taken away as your license and you're
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
not required to be licensed I also
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out um in terms of some
 
04:39:42.670 --> 04:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
of the critical shortage areas special
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
ed for example regardless of whether or
 
04:39:46.830 --> 04:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
not the state wants those people to be
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
certified the federal idea requires them
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
to be certified and licensed in certain
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
areas in order to provide the services
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
and students IEPs so this wouldn't
 
04:39:58.270 --> 04:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
really address that concern uh 30 hours
 
04:40:00.350 --> 04:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
is a significant amount of time if you
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
have a person that works uh Bell to Bell
 
04:40:05.230 --> 04:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
for example and the school day is 30 to
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
3 that's 35 hours so 30 hours a week is
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of time uh in a
 
04:40:13.628 --> 04:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
student's school day that you could be
 
04:40:15.868 --> 04:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
working with somebody who has not had
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
any teacher prep programming um and
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
teacher prep programming really uh
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
certainly focuses on all of the safety
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've talked about but
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
also just the P pedagogy concerns um
 
04:40:28.670 --> 04:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
some of the bills that have come from
 
04:40:30.868 --> 04:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
this committee most recently around very
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
specific uh instructional strategies
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
ways to deal with uh interventions
 
04:40:38.628 --> 04:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
concerns of students who potentially
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
aren't meeting uh concerning benchmarks
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
Etc um a person who is not certified or
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
has no intention of going through a
 
04:40:48.190 --> 04:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
teacher prep program would have no uh
 
04:40:50.110 --> 04:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily no exposure to those things
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why we would oppose this Bill
 
04:40:53.788 --> 04:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
for the school boards
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
Association not seeing any thank you
 
04:40:57.600 --> 04:40:59.390 align:start position:0%
Association not seeing any thank you
very

04:40:59.390 --> 04:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
much uh Steve Appleby from the
 
04:41:03.638 --> 04:41:09.550 align:start position:0%
much uh Steve Appleby from the
Department

04:41:09.550 --> 04:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair and representatives
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Steve app from the
 
04:41:16.030 --> 04:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh just want to
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
provide a couple of um technical items
 
04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is um RSA 189 colon 39b
 
04:41:26.110 --> 04:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
is the one-ear Certificate of
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
Eligibility that was expanded to two
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
years last year um here in the house and
 
04:41:34.150 --> 04:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate both um that allows an
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
individual ual to uh take the role as an
 
04:41:40.150 --> 04:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
educator without having a license um
 
04:41:42.830 --> 04:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're still subject to a uh criminal
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
history record check and the issuance of
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
a criminal history record check
 
04:41:49.788 --> 04:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
clearance by the department um and that
 
04:41:50.910 --> 04:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
can be
 
04:41:53.350 --> 04:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
revoked this bill mentions background
 
04:41:55.350 --> 04:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
check again or equ history record check
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
a clearance would be issued similar what
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing now for lots of different uh
 
04:42:02.310 --> 04:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
categories such as uh student teachers
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
bus drivers beginning educators their
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
first license we we run that check issue
 
04:42:08.990 --> 04:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
a clearance we do have the ability to
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
revoke that uh in our administrative
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
rules so um that would be I believe the
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
thinking from a misconduct standpoint as
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
we revoke the clearance which then means
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
work so I'm happy to answer any other
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
questions are there representative Miler
 
04:42:26.430 --> 04:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for being
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
here could you review for the committee
 
04:42:31.868 --> 04:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
the alternative certification process
 
04:42:34.990 --> 04:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
that one would go through sure thank you
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative so um currently we have
 
04:42:38.830 --> 04:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
what's called site-based
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
licensing and that is very similar to an
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
on the- job type of um system whereby a
 
04:42:47.350 --> 04:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
district hires an individual who has a
 
04:42:49.270 --> 04:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
degree and a certain number of credits
 
04:42:50.670 --> 04:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
in the content area that they'll be
 
04:42:53.708 --> 04:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
teaching and that person is uh put on a
 
04:42:56.070 --> 04:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
development plan and can spend up to
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
three years they work under a mentoring
 
04:42:59.310 --> 04:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
teacher so they're a teacher mentors all
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
over the state um and that individual
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
Works towards lure over 3 years working
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
full-time time uh in a school and while
 
04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
they're doing that they're also meeting
 
04:43:10.750 --> 04:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
the pieces of their plan so their plan
 
04:43:14.030 --> 04:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh may have some elements that are uh
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
coursework related it may have some
 
04:43:18.670 --> 04:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
experience requirements uh project
 
04:43:20.110 --> 04:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
requirements that type of thing whatever
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
the mentor and the principal or
 
04:43:24.430 --> 04:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent deem appropriate that
 
04:43:26.830 --> 04:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
will meet the lens your standard uh we
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
currently have about 1500 or so
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
individuals Statewide on a site based
 
04:43:35.830 --> 04:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
plan so um but that that is typically a
 
04:43:39.788 --> 04:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
three-year process follow go ahead uh so
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
as a followup with this proposal an
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
individual will not have to go through
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
that alternative certification pathway
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
is that correct that is correct yes
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent
 
04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:43:58.110 --> 04:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
04:44:00.788 --> 04:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
question it's a very specific question
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking it has to do with those
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
people who teach
 
04:44:08.670 --> 04:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
what might be called subspecialties in
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
technical Fields welding for example if
 
04:44:15.190 --> 04:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
you needed someone to teach hel Arch
 
04:44:18.390 --> 04:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
welding rather than just simple welding
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
you might have to go find someone who
 
04:44:23.708 --> 04:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
knew how to do hel Arch welding they
 
04:44:26.910 --> 04:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
would have been trained in a trade
 
04:44:29.430 --> 04:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
school but you need them to teach in the
 
04:44:29.440 --> 04:44:31.070 align:start position:0%
school but you need them to teach in the
high

04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
high
 
04:44:33.948 --> 04:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
school what does this process provide
 
04:44:37.150 --> 04:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
for you by the way of an alternative to
 
04:44:39.868 --> 04:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
get to someone who has a background in
 
04:44:42.788 --> 04:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
teaching teaching of people of the same
 
04:44:44.350 --> 04:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
age group
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
even but now they're teaching in a
 
04:44:48.990 --> 04:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
different setting does this enable you
 
04:44:50.190 --> 04:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:44:52.990 --> 04:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
that does it make it at least possible
 
04:44:56.230 --> 04:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
to recruit such a person and then have
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
them take online or on their own at
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
night or whenever the cours is to become
 
04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
certified at the second
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
level uh thank thank you for the
 
04:45:09.910 --> 04:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
question if I'm understanding correctly
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
what you're asking is if someone who has
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
this life experience from a career
 
04:45:16.520 --> 04:45:19.030 align:start position:0%
this life experience from a career
potentially

04:45:19.030 --> 04:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
04:45:23.070 --> 04:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
um this this would allow them I again if
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding correctly this would
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
allow let's say it's a non-ct high
 
04:45:29.430 --> 04:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
school but they wanted to add a welding
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
class they could bring an individual
 
04:45:33.868 --> 04:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
with welding experience in part-time
 
04:45:36.310 --> 04:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
without a license to teach that class
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
much for the questions I got a follow-up
 
04:45:44.590 --> 04:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
question for you two of them so if I'm
 
04:45:44.600 --> 04:45:45.868 align:start position:0%
question for you two of them so if I'm
looking

04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
looking
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
for a Spanish teacher as a high school
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
principal and there's no Spanish teacher
 
04:45:55.510 --> 04:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
out there but if I have a science
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
teacher who has a fluent understanding
 
04:46:01.230 --> 04:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
Spanish that is licensed to teach
 
04:46:04.510 --> 04:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
science that person can that person also
 
04:46:07.628 --> 04:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
teach Spanish if it's if he teaches in
 
04:46:09.990 --> 04:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
his area certified in more than 50% of
 
04:46:10.000 --> 04:46:11.030 align:start position:0%
his area certified in more than 50% of
the

04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you for the question so we
 
04:46:14.670 --> 04:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
have an administrative rule called we
 
04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
call the minor assignment rule uh and
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
that is in the uh 8300s and that allows
 
04:46:21.788 --> 04:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
for a licensed individual to teach
 
04:46:26.948 --> 04:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
outside their area of lure up to 49.9%
 
04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
of their workload so so they could be
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
and in fact we see this frequently
 
04:46:33.150 --> 04:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
around the state where an individual is
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
licensed in one area
 
04:46:36.590 --> 04:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
and they teach four classes in that area
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
and they teach one class outside of
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
their licensed area the second question
 
04:46:44.590 --> 04:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
I have when I got my principal ticket
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
over in Maine on my master's program it
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
came out as a supervising principal
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
that's what it was back in those days
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they called it in this state
 
04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
do you know through your working in the
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
area of certification can another
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
teacher evaluate another teacher or does
 
04:47:04.350 --> 04:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
it have to be somebody with that super
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
vising responsibility that's part of
 
04:47:07.320 --> 04:47:08.270 align:start position:0%
vising responsibility that's part of
their

04:47:08.270 --> 04:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:47:10.708 --> 04:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
endorsement uh thank you I I don't know
 
04:47:12.910 --> 04:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
the specific answer to that question
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
that seems like more of an employment
 
04:47:16.548 --> 04:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
question but what I can tell you is we
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
have over 1500 individuals on site based
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
plans who do have a mentoring
 
04:47:21.958 --> 04:47:24.030 align:start position:0%
plans who do have a mentoring
experienced

04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
educator overseeing uh their plan and
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
their progress through the plan
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
currently that's overseeing but it's not
 
04:47:31.948 --> 04:47:31.958 align:start position:0%
evaluating there whe they're going to go
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:38.990 --> 04:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
I I think there's some gray there yeah
 
04:47:40.548 --> 04:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
04:47:43.868 --> 04:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank
 
04:47:46.548 --> 04:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
you I have no more pink cards in this
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
one so we're going to close this
 
04:47:53.350 --> 04:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
hearing get a little bit
 
04:47:58.150 --> 04:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
closer uh we'll do 1458 that's relative
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
to authorizing parents to remove
 
04:48:01.390 --> 04:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
children from the English language
 
04:48:01.400 --> 04:48:03.030 align:start position:0%
children from the English language
learner

04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
learner
 
04:48:03.040 --> 04:48:05.628 align:start position:0%
learner
program

04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:48:07.868 --> 04:48:07.878 align:start position:0%
and I see representative Leon
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:48:19.310 --> 04:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
members of the education committee I
 
04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
bring this bill forward today because of
 
04:48:25.510 --> 04:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
my friend and her son um he is a very
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
capable very intelligent young man who
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
was the top of his class in both reading
 
04:48:33.070 --> 04:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
and writing his mom who is an amazing
 
04:48:34.590 --> 04:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
strong powerful business business owning
 
04:48:36.990 --> 04:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
woman who is not a native English
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
speaker had messed up filling out the
 
04:48:42.350 --> 04:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
forms and when it said what is your
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
child's native language she wrote her
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
native language Spanish on it it went
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
for a few years and um as her son was
 
04:48:53.628 --> 04:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
testing he got to be very uncomfortable
 
04:48:56.548 --> 04:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
in the testing that's used it's where
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
you go into a computer lab with other
 
04:49:01.548 --> 04:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
kids with headphones and microphones on
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
and you need to speak and give your
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
answers in English
 
04:49:06.430 --> 04:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
speaking into an empty room with
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable headphones into a
 
04:49:10.350 --> 04:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
microphone I know I've been
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable in that situation and I'm
 
04:49:14.110 --> 04:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
not surprised to hear that children are
 
04:49:16.990 --> 04:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
all uncomfortable in that situation he
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't speak because he was
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable so year after year he
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
failed the English uh proficiency test
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
on the computer because he didn't want
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
to speak yet he was a top performing
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
student in both reading and writing in
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
his class his mom went to the
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard and worked with them and
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
because it had been so much time since
 
04:49:39.910 --> 04:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
he had initially filled out that form um
 
04:49:41.390 --> 04:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
you couldn't just go through the normal
 
04:49:43.230 --> 04:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
process that she identified when she
 
04:49:46.628 --> 04:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
enrolled her his younger sister in and
 
04:49:48.110 --> 04:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
um her the younger sister was
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
immediately pulled back out of the El
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
program and was um going through the
 
04:49:54.990 --> 04:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
normal process because the daughter just
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
like the son were native English
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
speakers in a bilingual household um
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
he's now moved on to Junior High and she
 
04:50:04.270 --> 04:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
thought he'd be out of vll and would be
 
04:50:06.510 --> 04:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but he's still in the elll
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
program he hasn't res received services
 
04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
at all and I would bet you that he's not
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
alone I think that it's very critical
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
that for our students who need
 
04:50:19.868 --> 04:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
assistance getting up to speed with
 
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
English language learning that they have
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
all the resources that they need but I
 
04:50:26.830 --> 04:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
think that having some students that are
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
sort of Trapped in this program who
 
04:50:30.868 --> 04:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
don't actually need the services does a
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
disservice for that child and more
 
04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
importantly for those who actually need
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
this instruction we need to make sure
 
04:50:40.110 --> 04:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
that every child who needs instruction
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
to get up to speed and up to grade level
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
in English gets that assistance and
 
04:50:48.030 --> 04:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's why this is sort of a two-part
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
Bill the first says that if a student is
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
performing at grade level in reading and
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
writing then they'll be out if the
 
04:50:57.628 --> 04:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
parent requests it or if they um have
 
04:51:00.430 --> 04:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
not been provided the El Services I
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
think the larger issue would be if there
 
04:51:05.270 --> 04:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
are student that really really need this
 
04:51:07.310 --> 04:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
help and have gone for years without
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
having elll Services I recognize that we
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
have teaching shortages and that's why I
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
would retain the ability for the school
 
04:51:17.548 --> 04:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
district to appeal that these students
 
04:51:19.628 --> 04:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
would be automatically removed for not
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
receiving two years of elll service um
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
and I would assume that the State Board
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
would automatically grant that if
 
04:51:28.590 --> 04:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
they've been trying to find people to
 
04:51:30.670 --> 04:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
teach these students but if we start
 
04:51:32.190 --> 04:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
finding that multiple districts are
 
04:51:34.350 --> 04:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
having this problem then we may find
 
04:51:36.190 --> 04:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
that there's a crisis under our nose
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
with the our elll program you know
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
integrating students into our community
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
and making sure that they have the
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
skills to succeed as critical and
 
04:51:46.350 --> 04:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
starting off especially with young
 
04:51:49.070 --> 04:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
students making sure that they are
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
learning in English and that they have
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
received the skills that they need in
 
04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
order to do so as soon as possible is
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
critical you know we see what two years
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
of being out of the classroom is done to
 
04:52:01.470 --> 04:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
kids what about 2 years of sitting and
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
not really understanding what's
 
04:52:04.470 --> 04:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
happening because you need somebody to
 
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
help you key on to understand English
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
when you're in the classroom you know we
 
04:52:11.110 --> 04:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that both those
 
04:52:13.350 --> 04:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
students at grade level can get out if
 
04:52:15.470 --> 04:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
their parents want them to and that
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
we're providing the needed services for
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
those students who need them so I think
 
04:52:21.628 --> 04:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
that hopefully there'll be very little
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
impact from this bill but I think that
 
04:52:26.110 --> 04:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
it's important to both give that option
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
for parents to remove their High
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
performing students from the program and
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
to sort of send up a flag and a signal
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
if we we have a lot of students who are
 
04:52:37.708 --> 04:52:37.718 align:start position:0%
not being given um that given that
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
instruction which we as a state owe to
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
them so with that I'd be happy take
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
questions just for everybody here we do
 
04:52:46.830 --> 04:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
have the department here to a answer
 
04:52:48.910 --> 04:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
specific questions regarding this
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
program whether it be the statute or how
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's being administered so that's
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
available questions of the
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative representative kiss Kaden
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you y thank you
 
04:53:02.310 --> 04:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I am a
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
certified ESO teacher and still uh
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
provide assessments with weda and school
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
districts that can't find
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
somebody for a student to be removed
 
04:53:16.990 --> 04:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
from a program there is a process in the
 
04:53:19.990 --> 04:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
laow plan both the state plan and the
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
district plan if they have one that
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
specifies how it how a parent can go
 
04:53:27.708 --> 04:53:27.718 align:start position:0%
about having their child removed from
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
the services now Federal Law requires
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
that you test every student that doesn't
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
have a composite score for
 
04:53:36.868 --> 04:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
4.5 however if the student is doing
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
really well
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
academically testing I get it sometimes
 
04:53:45.070 --> 04:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
kids freeze up but there should be uh an
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
incentive for that child to go through
 
04:53:49.750 --> 04:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
that testing process it's pretty
 
04:53:52.590 --> 04:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
interactive and visual
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
cartoony um that if they're doing well
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
in reading and writing in the regular
 
04:53:59.070 --> 04:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
classroom through RTI or whatever
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
program they have they should reach that
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
composite score but in terms of
 
04:54:06.548 --> 04:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
reclassification a parent has the right
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
to decline the services and then that
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
happens and the form goes in the student
 
04:54:13.310 --> 04:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
file so I'm not sure what this would do
 
04:54:16.350 --> 04:54:16.360 align:start position:0%
different from what allow plan says you
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
can do well um thank you for that that
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
question um this mom spent three years
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get her son out of the program
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
and she was told that the only process
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
that she could have would be to appeal
 
04:54:31.110 --> 04:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
to the State Board of Education but she
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
was unable to get a time to go to the
 
04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
State Board of educ education and the
 
04:54:37.230 --> 04:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
process kept getting dropped um it seems
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
that this process is overly complex and
 
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
it seems that there may be some
 
04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
challenges and I appreciate how much
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
train training goes into being an ESO
 
04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
teacher my mom actually retired recently
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
from teaching in California where she
 
04:54:51.990 --> 04:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
was in the only grade level English only
 
04:54:54.750 --> 04:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
class because even as the English only
 
04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
teacher she needed to be changed in esol
 
04:54:59.788 --> 04:54:59.798 align:start position:0%
because it was such a migrant community
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
so it is challenging and it's good to
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
know that there are some safeguards but
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
um even in some of our largest districts
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
with the highest number of esol students
 
04:55:11.750 --> 04:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's either not known or not being um
 
04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
followed through on so I see I see a
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
need representative Cornell thank you
 
04:55:19.150 --> 04:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
04:55:20.990 --> 04:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
having been in the Manchester school
 
04:55:23.948 --> 04:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
district for 36 years I can agree with
 
04:55:26.750 --> 04:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
rep cascaden that there are so many
 
04:55:28.628 --> 04:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
students of need of services that they
 
04:55:30.548 --> 04:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
do not keep anybody in the program that
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be there um because
 
04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's just so many people in the
 
04:55:38.708 --> 04:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
program and and this is it isn't really
 
04:55:40.830 --> 04:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
a but would you believe that when a
 
04:55:42.628 --> 04:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
parent wanted their child out of that
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
program it happened very quickly and it
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
was pretty easy thing to do and there
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
was regular testing and if anybody
 
04:55:51.868 --> 04:55:51.878 align:start position:0%
tested out they were taken out they
 
04:55:54.310 --> 04:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
might have been taken out and watched
 
04:55:56.270 --> 04:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
for a certain amount of time to make
 
04:55:58.110 --> 04:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
sure that they were doing okay but
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
nobody was ever kept in against their
 
04:56:03.390 --> 04:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
will um thank you would it be possible I
 
04:56:04.990 --> 04:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
know that this bill we don't need to act
 
04:56:07.230 --> 04:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
on until the middle of March would it be
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
possible for you and me and the parent
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
to work with the Manchester School
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
District because that's where her son is
 
04:56:15.510 --> 04:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
enrolled to understand what's going on
 
04:56:17.708 --> 04:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
and what the disconnect is because
 
04:56:20.548 --> 04:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
there's clearly a disconnect we are the
 
04:56:22.830 --> 04:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
people who we are part of the people who
 
04:56:24.430 --> 04:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
can do something about it and if we can
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
identify a problem I'd love to work with
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
you on either figuring out at the
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
district level or at the state level
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
what to do thank you further questions
 
04:56:32.280 --> 04:56:36.510 align:start position:0%
what to do thank you further questions
rep

04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
I guess this will have to be a would you
 
04:56:42.990 --> 04:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
believe um yet another parent which I
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
almost thought that's who she was
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
talking about but the language was
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
Hungarian and the question was what
 
04:56:50.350 --> 04:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
language was spoken at home well it was
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
Hungarian didn't mean they didn't speak
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
English son was put in Hungarian and the
 
04:56:58.788 --> 04:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
mom could not I mean over two years have
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
gone by his English was fine his dad
 
04:57:05.830 --> 04:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
speaks English and yet he could not she
 
04:57:07.590 --> 04:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
had the hardest time trying to get him
 
04:57:10.230 --> 04:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
out of that program so it wasn't
 
04:57:12.868 --> 04:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
Manchester but it does happen and it's
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
not just okay we need a question now um
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that it's not just
 
04:57:22.030 --> 04:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
one I I believe that maybe we need to
 
04:57:23.548 --> 04:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
look at more than just Manchester but
 
04:57:24.788 --> 04:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
let's start there and figure out where
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
the disconnect is and then see if that's
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
something to that needs to be dealt with
 
04:57:29.628 --> 04:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
across the state any further questions
 
04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
from R and Leon thank you very much
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'd like to call U Melissa
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%

fredman

04:57:44.830 --> 04:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:47.830 --> 04:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
first uh Mr chair uh committee members
 
04:57:49.948 --> 04:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman Bridgewater I speak in
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and I'm happy to
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
support this one rather than the one
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
this morning that I spoke in favor of um
 
04:58:01.590 --> 04:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's one thing to take away Services uh
 
04:58:04.110 --> 04:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
or not offer but actually this is
 
04:58:06.750 --> 04:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who this is a circumstance
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
where the parent says I don't want the
 
04:58:08.878 --> 04:58:10.190 align:start position:0%
where the parent says I don't want the
services

04:58:10.190 --> 04:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
so it should in my mind this should be
 
04:58:14.590 --> 04:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
why make it hard for them I mean the
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
parent knows their child better than
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else and generally parents want
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
more services not less so if they say I
 
04:58:25.548 --> 04:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
don't need this anymore why make it hard
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
let's make it easy let the kid out um on
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note um it's talking about
 
04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
State funding please for once let's keep
 
04:58:36.270 --> 04:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
politics out of this let's
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
just honor individuality if the kid
 
04:58:41.070 --> 04:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't need it let's make it easy and
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
this bill seems to do it and then again
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
it does have this um clause about the
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
school district is able to appeal if
 
04:58:52.110 --> 04:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
there is some kind of um unusual reason
 
04:58:54.750 --> 04:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
that they feel that the kids should uh
 
04:58:56.830 --> 04:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
still be left in the program so there
 
04:58:58.548 --> 04:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
could that could maybe cover some
 
04:59:02.190 --> 04:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstance so uh that's why I
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
support the bill I say let the kid out
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
if the parent says they don't need it
 
04:59:08.830 --> 04:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
and let somebody else in you're actually
 
04:59:11.310 --> 04:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
taking a spot so that's why I support
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you very much are there
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you thank you
 
04:59:15.600 --> 04:59:24.350 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you thank you
Melissa

04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:26.430 --> 04:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
white good afternoon Melissa white
 
04:59:28.030 --> 04:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
division director for learner support at
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education I just um
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions I think um
 
04:59:35.548 --> 04:59:35.558 align:start position:0%
the information that was provided um
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
kind of summed it up but I can provide a
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more clarification with
 
04:59:41.070 --> 04:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
regards to I just want to make a
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
distinction between services and
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
identification so a student that is
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
identified as an English language
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
learner and then providing services are
 
04:59:52.390 --> 04:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
are kind of two separate things parents
 
04:59:54.510 --> 04:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
can say they do not want Services they
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
do not want their child to be provided
 
04:59:59.948 --> 04:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
with any type of language supports so
 
05:00:01.390 --> 05:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
they can say they do not want those
 
05:00:03.548 --> 05:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
services so just wanted to to clarify
 
05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
that that's a little bit different than
 
05:00:08.110 --> 05:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
um saying identification wise you can't
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
opt out of of an identification if
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're identified as an English language
 
05:00:14.548 --> 05:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
learner you meet all of the criteria um
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is part of that
 
05:00:18.510 --> 05:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
identification process is that home
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
language survey the home language survey
 
05:00:23.070 --> 05:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
there is one question about you know
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
what language is spoken in the home but
 
05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
there are multiple other questions that
 
05:00:29.070 --> 05:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
go on with the home language survey that
 
05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
are pretty detailed so it's not just the
 
05:00:32.910 --> 05:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
one question and the students
 
05:00:34.510 --> 05:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
automatically identified as an English
 
05:00:36.190 --> 05:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
language learner there's multiple pieces
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
to that in addition to an English
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
language learner screener that's
 
05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
provided before they're ever identified
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
so there's a pretty um involved process
 
05:00:46.868 --> 05:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
it's just not check a box and you're
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
automatically identified so I'm going to
 
05:00:51.670 --> 05:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that piece of it um the other
 
05:00:54.990 --> 05:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
part with regards to students um who
 
05:00:57.230 --> 05:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
have not received the El L services in
 
05:00:59.070 --> 05:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
the preceding two years shall be
 
05:01:01.948 --> 05:01:01.958 align:start position:0%
automatically removed from the program
 
05:01:05.548 --> 05:01:05.558 align:start position:0%
um that could potentially create some
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
issues for the state as that would go
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
against some of the requirements that
 
05:01:14.430 --> 05:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
are in Essa and could potentially impact
 
05:01:16.750 --> 05:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
Federal funding so I just want to be
 
05:01:20.110 --> 05:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
clear that um if a student is identified
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
and they're not receiving those services
 
05:01:25.110 --> 05:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
that is okay but for us to remove them
 
05:01:27.788 --> 05:01:27.798 align:start position:0%
from identification we're not allowed to
 
05:01:30.030 --> 05:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
do that piece of it so just want to
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
clarify they have to actually have um um
 
05:01:36.150 --> 05:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
as representative cascaden mentioned
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
they have to have some of those
 
05:01:40.948 --> 05:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
qualifying factors for being um taken
 
05:01:44.310 --> 05:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
out of that identification process if a
 
05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
student is proficient in reading and
 
05:01:50.590 --> 05:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
writing and that is shown on any type of
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
Assessments whether they be the progress
 
05:01:55.110 --> 05:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring that's happening within the
 
05:01:56.670 --> 05:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
school district or the Statewide
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
assessment then they would um
 
05:02:02.230 --> 05:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
automatically be exited from
 
05:02:04.070 --> 05:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
identification and services and then
 
05:02:05.430 --> 05:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
kind of put on a
 
05:02:08.750 --> 05:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring um watch but they wouldn't be
 
05:02:10.590 --> 05:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
required to continue to take the
 
05:02:14.190 --> 05:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
assessment so if the students did uh
 
05:02:15.868 --> 05:02:15.878 align:start position:0%
come out proficient on that assessment
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
then they wouldn't be technically
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
required to take that test so that's a
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
piece we can work through with parents
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
and um in particular if there's any
 
05:02:25.708 --> 05:02:25.718 align:start position:0%
issues or concerns that come up we can
 
05:02:28.510 --> 05:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
always at the department help to to kind
 
05:02:31.270 --> 05:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
of um process those with those
 
05:02:33.470 --> 05:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
families thank you very much much most I
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
do have a question for you I've heard
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
the word monitoring several times today
 
05:02:39.788 --> 05:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
and in special ed that became quite an
 
05:02:41.708 --> 05:02:41.718 align:start position:0%
issue years back where kids would put on
 
05:02:41.718 --> 05:02:42.708 align:start position:0%
issue years back where kids would put on
monitor

05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
for years thereafter and collecting the
 
05:02:48.430 --> 05:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
money from the state for absolutely no
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
contact from the therapist or whomever
 
05:02:52.270 --> 05:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
it may be that was a common
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
practice uh is while a a student is put
 
05:02:59.590 --> 05:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
on monitoring do they receive uh are
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
they still identified as a person that
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
is receiving English language learner uh
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
support and if so are they receiving
 
05:03:10.990 --> 05:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
funding through adequacy for it part no
 
05:03:12.548 --> 05:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
adequacy I do not believe I would like
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
to double check that with our our team
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm pretty sure that um once the
 
05:03:20.830 --> 05:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
student is exited from Services we keep
 
05:03:23.310 --> 05:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
a monitoring status so that's if within
 
05:03:25.310 --> 05:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
let's say the next two or three four
 
05:03:27.788 --> 05:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
years that student ends
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
up not doing well and their teachers and
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
their team team decide maybe they could
 
05:03:37.390 --> 05:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
benefit from some supports then we can
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
look at reidentifying them and putting
 
05:03:43.150 --> 05:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
them back into elll services but that
 
05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be decided without you know the
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
students um educational team and the
 
05:03:49.590 --> 05:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
family being involved with that process
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
so it's really looking at their their
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
their how well they're doing in school
 
05:03:57.788 --> 05:03:57.798 align:start position:0%
that's what the monitoring is for
 
05:03:59.788 --> 05:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
different from special education
 
05:04:01.868 --> 05:04:01.878 align:start position:0%
represent my thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:04:03.150 --> 05:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
05:04:05.190 --> 05:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
a couple or two clarifying questions
 
05:04:08.910 --> 05:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
please when you heard represent lon's uh
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh report on the particular individual
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
that that's a an acquaintance of theirs
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
first question what is the incident rate
 
05:04:19.548 --> 05:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
that you've heard of this kind of a
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
problem where a parent wants to have
 
05:04:24.150 --> 05:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
their child removed that's question one
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
question two is uh is there a universal
 
05:04:31.150 --> 05:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
process for the removal of a child from
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh an El program or is that left up to
 
05:04:36.110 --> 05:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
the policies of the local school
 
05:04:38.430 --> 05:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
district thank you for your answer thank
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
you for the question so with regards to
 
05:04:43.830 --> 05:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
accepting services so if a student has
 
05:04:45.788 --> 05:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
is identified and they've gone through
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
the identification and the screening
 
05:04:49.270 --> 05:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
process the services are offered but the
 
05:04:51.430 --> 05:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
parents can at that time opt to not take
 
05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
the service they they can say you know I
 
05:04:54.670 --> 05:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
don't want my my child to be serviced
 
05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
and that so that's that's a part of that
 
05:04:59.548 --> 05:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
that process and uh developing the
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
individualized language learning plan
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
with that student
 
05:05:06.430 --> 05:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
um so usually the district is involved
 
05:05:08.270 --> 05:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
the school is involved with making that
 
05:05:11.350 --> 05:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
determination of those services with the
 
05:05:13.830 --> 05:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
family and then families at that time
 
05:05:16.990 --> 05:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
usually can say they do not want um
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
those Services um we do I can't I
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't put a number on it because I
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't track the the calls that we get in
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
but if we get concerns coming in from
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
time to time not frequently um we we'll
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
just help to kind of negotiate or to to
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
um mediate that with the district and
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
with the family so that they are aware
 
05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
of all the Avenues that are available to
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
them but it's usually something we're
 
05:05:43.390 --> 05:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
able to to work with the districts on
 
05:05:45.070 --> 05:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
and work with the families on thank you
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee ref
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
leus thank you for taking my question
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make sure I I understand
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
this in the beginning they fill out this
 
05:06:00.270 --> 05:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
questionnaire they could be
 
05:06:04.030 --> 05:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
identified but the parents May say he
 
05:06:06.270 --> 05:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't need this we don't we won't want
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
to do the services and in fact the child
 
05:06:14.110 --> 05:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
could be doing perfectly fine in school
 
05:06:17.230 --> 05:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
um but you said they still have to be
 
05:06:21.510 --> 05:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
identified correct so the question
 
05:06:26.590 --> 05:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
is does the state as far as far
 
05:06:30.590 --> 05:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
as the bump that you get for elll do
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
they get that if you're identified or
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
only if you're providing services so I'm
 
05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
looking more at the the component for
 
05:06:42.510 --> 05:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
title three in the identification for um
 
05:06:45.310 --> 05:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
the esa title program so title 3 is a
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
federal fund that we received to support
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
students um of course Manchester and NWA
 
05:06:53.310 --> 05:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
um receive the largest allocations of
 
05:06:55.948 --> 05:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
title 3 funding in addition to there's
 
05:06:58.390 --> 05:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
um some reporting components for for
 
05:07:01.350 --> 05:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
title 1A um in supporting those students
 
05:07:04.510 --> 05:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
in acquiring uh English proficiency so
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
I'm coming at it from that lens I would
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
like to um look a little bit more
 
05:07:15.470 --> 05:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
closely on the the state adequacy side
 
05:07:17.708 --> 05:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
um because it's my my understanding but
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure and not speak
 
05:07:22.190 --> 05:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
incorrectly but I I'm coming and
 
05:07:24.910 --> 05:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
testifying on that that lens so kind of
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
that Federal funding lens thank you very
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
much sorry so Melissa I'm I would like
 
05:07:31.990 --> 05:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
to pursue the adequacy side of this
 
05:07:32.000 --> 05:07:33.708 align:start position:0%
to pursue the adequacy side of this
issue

05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:07:35.948 --> 05:07:35.958 align:start position:0%
I see Caitlyn back
 
05:07:38.910 --> 05:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
there Caitlyn do you have any kind of
 
05:07:47.708 --> 05:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:51.868 --> 05:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
right okay Dr Green will take you stuff
 
05:07:55.390 --> 05:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
it good afternoon so the question is if
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
they're identified as bre and leus just
 
05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned but they choose not to take
 
05:08:06.548 --> 05:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
that program are we then using adequacy
 
05:08:09.270 --> 05:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
dollars to support that person being
 
05:08:12.788 --> 05:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
identified as a elll student so in this
 
05:08:14.070 --> 05:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
case when we're talking about State
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding the initial
 
05:08:17.628 --> 05:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
identification comes from administering
 
05:08:20.230 --> 05:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
the screener and the screener is what uh
 
05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
tells the school district whether or not
 
05:08:23.670 --> 05:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
that student needs services so the
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
parent can opt out of those services but
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
the screener still says that the student
 
05:08:30.590 --> 05:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
was identified as an elll learner so as
 
05:08:32.430 --> 05:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
an active elll learner that school would
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
receive the adequacy funding tied to an
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
apportionment represent
 
05:08:45.788 --> 05:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
leus so once the parent comes in and
 
05:08:49.470 --> 05:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
says take them out of this does that
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
adequacy money go away or does it follow
 
05:08:54.510 --> 05:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
them for the rest of their schooling or
 
05:08:57.430 --> 05:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
how does that work so each year
 
05:08:59.788 --> 05:08:59.798 align:start position:0%
thereafter even if the student isn't
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
receiving Services they'll still take a
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
test each year to determine what level
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
of English proficiency they have um so
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
the parents are just opting out of the
 
05:09:11.628 --> 05:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
services provided by the program it may
 
05:09:13.628 --> 05:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
be that in you know a year or two years
 
05:09:15.788 --> 05:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
or three years that student is testing
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
proficient in English and at that point
 
05:09:19.070 --> 05:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be identified as an El
 
05:09:20.708 --> 05:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
learner anymore and the district would
 
05:09:22.150 --> 05:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
not continue to receive that state
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy money but there is a testing
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
component that still occurs each
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
year thank you are there further
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
05:09:31.120 --> 05:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
questions of the
department

05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:09:35.230 --> 05:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much both of you thank
 
05:09:37.390 --> 05:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you so I have no more pink
 
05:09:39.030 --> 05:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
cards on this one so we're going to
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
close this
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%

welcome good
[Music]

05:10:21.750 --> 05:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon for the record
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
and representative poll serving the
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
towns of dun Barton hooks at Allenstown
 
05:10:29.280 --> 05:10:30.030 align:start position:0%
towns of dun Barton hooks at Allenstown
in

05:10:30.030 --> 05:10:30.040 align:start position:0%

05:10:33.270 --> 05:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
Epson I'm here in support of House Bill
 
05:10:36.150 --> 05:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
1496 it's a very simple Bill only adds
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:42.270 --> 05:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
sentences and this is relative to what
 
05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
does the state's obligation have to
 
05:10:46.030 --> 05:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
protect the students in the care during
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
school there's been an ongoing issue
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
that goes back even to the mid90s um
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
there is a case and I will send the
 
05:10:58.270 --> 05:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
members of this committee a copy of this
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
case um marway versus Eno from 19
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
1995 um back then um several young girls
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
were um abused by various employees
 
05:11:13.708 --> 05:11:13.718 align:start position:0%
within the depart or within the school
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
system and the parents couldn't find
 
05:11:19.070 --> 05:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
relief and they couldn't find relief and
 
05:11:20.548 --> 05:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
they ultimately took it up through the
 
05:11:22.030 --> 05:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
federal courts and the federal courts
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
asked the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
05:11:25.868 --> 05:11:25.878 align:start position:0%
what was their opinion of various
 
05:11:28.548 --> 05:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
statutes and is there any obligation or
 
05:11:30.190 --> 05:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
duty to protect the children while the
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:34.920 --> 05:11:36.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:11:36.750 --> 05:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not real
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
clear the bottom line is even with this
 
05:11:43.628 --> 05:11:43.638 align:start position:0%
case and several others that have been
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
built on this case it's not real
 
05:11:49.230 --> 05:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
clear what is the duty for the school
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
system to make sure the children are
 
05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
safe and I do believe that there is an
 
05:11:56.350 --> 05:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
obligation I believe every parent in the
 
05:11:58.670 --> 05:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
state believes there's an
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
obligation but unfortunately it's not in
 
05:12:01.600 --> 05:12:03.110 align:start position:0%
obligation but unfortunately it's not in
our

05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:12:05.470 --> 05:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
statutes I'm not sure if this is the
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
proper language I would reach out maybe
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
to the doe to make sure that um they
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
have legal counsel or maybe there's
 
05:12:14.830 --> 05:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else who who can weigh in from
 
05:12:17.310 --> 05:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
the AG's office if if this is in fact
 
05:12:19.590 --> 05:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
the best way to do this
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
language it was the best we could draft
 
05:12:23.628 --> 05:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
during the OS drafting
 
05:12:27.190 --> 05:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
period um in terms of using terms like
 
05:12:28.830 --> 05:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable care to protect the child
 
05:12:30.670 --> 05:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
during the school
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
hours um
 
05:12:34.030 --> 05:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
and that goes back to the one Supreme
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
Court case that I'm going to mention to
 
05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
you there may be a better way to do
 
05:12:42.990 --> 05:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
this the reason this bill is here is
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
when parents drop their children off at
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
school they're gone they're they're not
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
there for the day the school is acting
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
as the parental Guardian during those
 
05:12:55.510 --> 05:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
hours the child is in the
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
classroom and that would TR that would
 
05:13:00.510 --> 05:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
be true on a sports athletic field with
 
05:13:04.150 --> 05:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
a coach for instance after work but in
 
05:13:05.910 --> 05:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
the case of after school activities the
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
parent has made the decision to have the
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
children there and unfortunately the
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
case that I'm referencing had to do with
 
05:13:14.110 --> 05:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
um at least one of the three children
 
05:13:16.270 --> 05:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
had to do with
 
05:13:20.430 --> 05:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
um a coach in an after school activity
 
05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
but in the case of the education during
 
05:13:24.990 --> 05:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
the hours that the children are
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
learning the state has made a
 
05:13:30.310 --> 05:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
requirement that the children be there
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
we don't have learning requirements
 
05:13:34.670 --> 05:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
ments in the state of New Hampshire um
 
05:13:36.868 --> 05:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
we have education we have truancy
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
requirements we have compulsory
 
05:13:39.628 --> 05:13:39.638 align:start position:0%
attendance requirements there's a lot of
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
things we could say but we don't have a
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
requirement today to teach the child we
 
05:13:44.548 --> 05:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
have a requirement that they show up and
 
05:13:45.788 --> 05:13:45.798 align:start position:0%
be in the
 
05:13:48.910 --> 05:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
classroom um that's what our laws say it
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
would be great if they learned that's
 
05:13:51.750 --> 05:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
important I'm not diminishing the
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
importance of education but I'm saying
 
05:13:56.110 --> 05:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
our laws are treny based laws and we
 
05:13:57.548 --> 05:13:57.558 align:start position:0%
require students to show up during a
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
certain number of hours and that is in
 
05:14:01.868 --> 05:14:01.878 align:start position:0%
keeping with Supreme Court decisions
 
05:14:03.868 --> 05:14:03.878 align:start position:0%
about if you're compelling a person to
 
05:14:06.030 --> 05:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
be someplace then the state takes on a
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
new obligation relative to the
 
05:14:10.830 --> 05:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
production of that of that
 
05:14:13.350 --> 05:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
individual I would ask that you at a
 
05:14:15.150 --> 05:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
minimum study this because this needs
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
some time and attention because there's
 
05:14:20.990 --> 05:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
clearly a gap in our statutes between
 
05:14:23.310 --> 05:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
what parents expect relative to the
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
protection of their children and what
 
05:14:28.350 --> 05:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
the current statutes say and or other
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
decisions that have happened both at the
 
05:14:32.110 --> 05:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court and the US
 
05:14:34.590 --> 05:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court relative to what is the
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
children as I said earlier this came out
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
of os this was the best place we could
 
05:14:44.788 --> 05:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
think to put this in the statutes I sat
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
on this committee a decade ago there may
 
05:14:51.788 --> 05:14:51.798 align:start position:0%
be a better place I'm open to that um
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is kind of at the highest level and
 
05:14:55.868 --> 05:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
it wasn't real clear within let's say
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
193 or some of the other places where
 
05:15:01.070 --> 05:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
this could go hav touch these statutes
 
05:15:03.190 --> 05:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
at the level you guys do for for a
 
05:15:04.990 --> 05:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
decade but I believe there probably this
 
05:15:06.548 --> 05:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
is at least one place to put it there
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
might be a better place to put this
 
05:15:11.750 --> 05:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
language relative to um when we're and
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
potentially in the treny sections um if
 
05:15:16.350 --> 05:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
we're compelling kids to be in the
 
05:15:19.070 --> 05:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
classroom because it's good and
 
05:15:21.230 --> 05:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
important then we make we should be
 
05:15:22.708 --> 05:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're safe in that
 
05:15:24.548 --> 05:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
classroom thank you very much and with
 
05:15:27.390 --> 05:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
that I'll end my testimony represent
 
05:15:30.270 --> 05:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
leus I do have a question with the
 
05:15:34.230 --> 05:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
wording if we go with this wording does
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
that give the state as acting in local
 
05:15:43.948 --> 05:15:43.958 align:start position:0%
parenes the ability to give medicines
 
05:15:47.390 --> 05:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines Etc during the time that the
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
child is in school that's a great
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
question um and for the record locco
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
parenes should be in italics I think um
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
it is a good question I don't have an
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer for that that would be
 
05:16:05.150 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
I would run that by the doe in terms of
 
05:16:05.160 --> 05:16:06.030 align:start position:0%
I would run that by the doe in terms of
if

05:16:06.030 --> 05:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:16:09.150 --> 05:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
it's if this is considered the fully
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
acting have we transferred that much
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
authority to the classroom these are the
 
05:16:14.230 --> 05:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be vetted on this
 
05:16:16.750 --> 05:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
it's a great question further
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.480 --> 05:16:38.270 align:start position:0%
 
Association

05:16:38.270 --> 05:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:39.948 --> 05:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you chairman lad good
 
05:16:41.310 --> 05:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee bar
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
Christina uh from the school boards
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
Association we're not taking a position
 
05:16:47.350 --> 05:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh I just wanted to come
 
05:16:49.150 --> 05:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
and comment a couple of things I want to
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank representative hall for the for
 
05:16:52.590 --> 05:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
the bill in general and um also
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing that he um that the bill may
 
05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
may need some work and the language may
 
05:16:59.230 --> 05:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
not be specific because those were a
 
05:17:00.548 --> 05:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
couple of the things that jumped out to
 
05:17:04.110 --> 05:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
nsba uh when we were reviewing the bill
 
05:17:06.310 --> 05:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
um the the first thing that I might want
 
05:17:08.830 --> 05:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
to just sort of clarify were whereas the
 
05:17:11.670 --> 05:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
bill talks about the state requirements
 
05:17:13.390 --> 05:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
and the state is acting as temporary
 
05:17:17.430 --> 05:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
Guardian in local parus the the the law
 
05:17:18.990 --> 05:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
the case that representative hle
 
05:17:21.990 --> 05:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
mentions Mar Eno um the court sort of
 
05:17:23.470 --> 05:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
drilled that down a little bit and it's
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
it's the school district that is
 
05:17:27.670 --> 05:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
actually acting in in local parentis and
 
05:17:29.390 --> 05:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
not the state is sort of the larger
 
05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
entity because the school district is
 
05:17:33.150 --> 05:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
the one that's responsible for
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
overseeing the employees making sure
 
05:17:37.390 --> 05:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
that the students are being properly uh
 
05:17:39.628 --> 05:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
supervised so on and so forth so that
 
05:17:42.830 --> 05:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
was one one aspect um uh of of
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
clarification that I wanted to bring to
 
05:17:47.470 --> 05:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
the committee um the other aspects um
 
05:17:49.510 --> 05:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
that we just wanted to clarify and
 
05:17:52.110 --> 05:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative lakus your your question
 
05:17:54.910 --> 05:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
um about sort of vaccines and Medicine
 
05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
um were kind of in the along the lines
 
05:17:59.910 --> 05:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
of of some of the things NH hsba was was
 
05:18:02.590 --> 05:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
thinking um know I don't know if
 
05:18:04.510 --> 05:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment is still used in
 
05:18:07.030 --> 05:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
schools anymore it is allowed under New
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law RSA 627 colon 6 paragraph
 
05:18:13.948 --> 05:18:13.958 align:start position:0%
2A does still allow for corporal
 
05:18:16.150 --> 05:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
punishment in school districts nhba will
 
05:18:18.110 --> 05:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
not Advocate that that occurs but I just
 
05:18:19.628 --> 05:18:19.638 align:start position:0%
want to put that out there for acting a
 
05:18:22.830 --> 05:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
local parentice we might have the uh the
 
05:18:25.150 --> 05:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
the reasonable justification for taking
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
wood spoon to the kid who's to the kid
 
05:18:30.750 --> 05:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
who's who's Who's acting up um uh
 
05:18:34.390 --> 05:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps um uh more controversial um you
 
05:18:36.190 --> 05:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned the vaccines representative
 
05:18:38.270 --> 05:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
lakus I wrote down what about masking
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
requirements um that was a bit of a
 
05:18:42.110 --> 05:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
contention in school districts maybe
 
05:18:45.070 --> 05:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
three years ago um so just some other
 
05:18:47.310 --> 05:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
considerations there is I don't want to
 
05:18:49.548 --> 05:18:49.558 align:start position:0%
call it a direct conflict between what
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'll just call quote unquote parental
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
rights versus in local parentis but as
 
05:18:57.070 --> 05:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative whole recognized there
 
05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
may be there's going to have to be some
 
05:19:00.470 --> 05:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
give and take there if we're giving
 
05:19:02.270 --> 05:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
school districts local par full and
 
05:19:04.750 --> 05:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
local parentice responsibilities between
 
05:19:07.548 --> 05:19:07.558 align:start position:0%
the you know hours of 8 and three versus
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
what some of the other parental rights
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
would be in terms of curriculum and
 
05:19:13.470 --> 05:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
opting out of courses and we had some
 
05:19:15.150 --> 05:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
bills this morning that sort of touched
 
05:19:17.070 --> 05:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
on some of those things didn't we so
 
05:19:18.670 --> 05:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
anyway we're not taking a position on
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
the bill um it was more just for nsba to
 
05:19:23.750 --> 05:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
provide um some level of background and
 
05:19:25.548 --> 05:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
clarification for the committee and I'm
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
05:19:29.708 --> 05:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
I'll start out with one question is the
 
05:19:32.070 --> 05:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
terminology local parenes
 
05:19:32.080 --> 05:19:33.190 align:start position:0%
terminology local parenes
in

05:19:33.190 --> 05:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:19:36.948 --> 05:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
statute now it it is not it's a it's a
 
05:19:39.708 --> 05:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
common law phrase in the location of the
 
05:19:42.548 --> 05:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
parents um and I just did a quick search
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't think the the I don't think
 
05:19:48.430 --> 05:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
that phrase per se or directly is used
 
05:19:50.948 --> 05:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
um in the marqu v Eno case but in some
 
05:19:52.350 --> 05:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
of the what we called I think we called
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
them headnotes when I was in law school
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
um it says um
 
05:20:01.948 --> 05:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
uh where is it um authority of schools
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
the duty of supervision falls upon those
 
05:20:06.030 --> 05:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
School Employees who have super
 
05:20:08.590 --> 05:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
supervisory responsibility over over
 
05:20:10.590 --> 05:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
students and who have stepped into the
 
05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
role of Parental proxy is what the the
 
05:20:16.150 --> 05:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
language of of of the case is using um
 
05:20:18.030 --> 05:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
and it says School Employees who share
 
05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
parental proxy who share a parental
 
05:20:22.548 --> 05:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
proxy relationship with the student and
 
05:20:24.590 --> 05:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
who learn of facts um which would lead a
 
05:20:25.948 --> 05:20:25.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable person to conclude the
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
student is being abused are subject to
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
liability if their supervision is
 
05:20:32.230 --> 05:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and it is approximate cause
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the students injury so um so whereas
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
representative hold to your question
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
though in local parentice is not used in
 
05:20:41.750 --> 05:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
statute and while we don't have any sort
 
05:20:44.390 --> 05:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
of overarching statutes about the school
 
05:20:45.830 --> 05:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
district's responsibility to keep
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
students safe when the student is in the
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
custody of of the uh uh of of the school
 
05:20:52.990 --> 05:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
or not the custody but in the the care
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
and supervision of the school district
 
05:20:56.788 --> 05:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
we do have the teacher code of conduct
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
as well too in the administrative rules
 
05:20:59.990 --> 05:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
that there's Provisions in there about
 
05:21:01.788 --> 05:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
keeping students safe broadly in
 
05:21:04.430 --> 05:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
generally but in statute not directly no
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
as an
 
05:21:08.470 --> 05:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
attorney could you please help me out
 
05:21:11.230 --> 05:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
with this then whenever we went in years
 
05:21:13.390 --> 05:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
ago because local parentice was in a lot
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
of State statutes elsewhere at one time
 
05:21:18.390 --> 05:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
not now and I was always advised by the
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
people across the street don't use that
 
05:21:24.070 --> 05:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't put that terminology into statute
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
why would they say that um that's a good
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
question I don't know I'd like to hear
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%

you okay I haven't done a admittedly I
 
05:21:37.350 --> 05:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
haven't done a full research on in local
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
parenes I did some some quick research
 
05:21:40.708 --> 05:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
over the weekend would and do like a
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
deep dive into it nationwide or read any
 
05:21:45.470 --> 05:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
legal journals or anything on it just a
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
quick preparation for the Bill thank you
 
05:21:49.470 --> 05:21:49.480 align:start position:0%

and that is all we have on that
 
05:21:55.670 --> 05:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
particular bill so we conclude that one
 
05:21:58.270 --> 05:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
and get on to the next bill which is
 
05:22:01.150 --> 05:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
1692 I'm going introduce that yeah we're
 
05:22:01.160 --> 05:22:04.350 align:start position:0%
1692 I'm going introduce that yeah we're
getting

05:22:04.350 --> 05:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%

05:22:49.510 --> 05:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay HB
 
05:22:52.390 --> 05:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
1692 is relative to public high school
 
05:22:52.400 --> 05:22:56.150 align:start position:0%
1692 is relative to public high school
graduation

05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:59.830 --> 05:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
requirements here stack next bill okay
 
05:23:02.190 --> 05:23:02.200 align:start position:0%

to um introduce this bill for him and um
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
I think this goes along with um some
 
05:23:29.510 --> 05:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
other bills that we've had over the past
 
05:23:33.708 --> 05:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
two years uh trying to look at um
 
05:23:36.948 --> 05:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
satisfying High School requirements and
 
05:23:36.958 --> 05:23:38.548 align:start position:0%
satisfying High School requirements and

um um this is really the first time I'm
 
05:23:45.868 --> 05:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
reading the bill so I I think I'll leave
 
05:23:48.310 --> 05:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
that are there any questions of

bill pardon me let's see oh that was
 
05:24:05.310 --> 05:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
okay that was on top
 
05:24:12.310 --> 05:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:12.320 --> 05:24:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
Freedman

05:24:17.670 --> 05:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chairman committee members
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman Bridgewater I'm also
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
happy to support this bill um well we
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
need to have some kind of minimum re
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
requirements to get a high school
 
05:24:36.030 --> 05:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
diploma and the way it is now kids are
 
05:24:39.510 --> 05:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
just graduating with po really not
 
05:24:41.830 --> 05:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
prepared um and I've got the scores here
 
05:24:43.990 --> 05:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
for my own School District the high
 
05:24:47.548 --> 05:24:47.558 align:start position:0%
school Ela 68% and that's as high as
 
05:24:51.548 --> 05:24:51.558 align:start position:0%
I've seen it in a long time math
 
05:24:55.628 --> 05:24:55.638 align:start position:0%
32% 32% these are 11th graders unless
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
they really drastically improved in 12th
 
05:25:01.270 --> 05:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
grade um that's and that's the late ones
 
05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
off the uh Department of Education
 
05:25:06.190 --> 05:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
website and science is
 
05:25:09.948 --> 05:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
44% so we've got to raise the standards
 
05:25:12.510 --> 05:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
I think having a minimum the 25th
 
05:25:16.150 --> 05:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
percentile is it's a pretty low bar uh
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
but it at least it's something I mean
 
05:25:20.390 --> 05:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're paying a fortune if you think
 
05:25:23.390 --> 05:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
about it like 20,000 a year times 13
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
years is what I don't know quarter of a
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
million or something like that there
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
should be something for the taxpayers to
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
show that the students are ready to move
 
05:25:37.430 --> 05:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
on into the Adult World um the bill does
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
include a remedial plan so it's not like
 
05:25:42.750 --> 05:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
suddenly it just okay folks if you don't
 
05:25:44.670 --> 05:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
meet this you're going to be out of luck
 
05:25:49.030 --> 05:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
it does offer a remedial plan uh to get
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
those scores up and it doesn't seem to
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
limit the number of times the student
 
05:25:58.510 --> 05:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
could take the uh exam so uh so
 
05:26:00.788 --> 05:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
presumably you could take it a few times
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
until you could get your diploma so it
 
05:26:04.910 --> 05:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't throw them out in the cold it's
 
05:26:07.628 --> 05:26:07.638 align:start position:0%
got a minimum and uh as far as the
 
05:26:09.788 --> 05:26:09.798 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm generally not crazy
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
about additional Education costs uh but
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
there would be some and I guess in this
 
05:26:18.190 --> 05:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
case it might be worth it and in the
 
05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
long run I think the estimates are I
 
05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
think it's like 412,000 then it goes to
 
05:26:26.708 --> 05:26:26.718 align:start position:0%
300,000 a year and then 200,000 a year
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
presumably I think if the proper
 
05:26:31.270 --> 05:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
incentive to get that High School imp
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
ploma uh will make kids work harder and
 
05:26:36.310 --> 05:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they won't take need to take the
 
05:26:38.910 --> 05:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
test so many extra times so maybe the
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
cost will be less than anticipated so I
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
think it's it's time to have a minimum
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
for a diploma and that's why I support
 
05:26:48.430 --> 05:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you are there any
 
05:26:50.910 --> 05:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
questions of Mr
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
fredman not seeing thank you very much
 
05:26:56.150 --> 05:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Becky Wilson from New
 
05:26:58.590 --> 05:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association do
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for hearing my testimony
 
05:27:08.948 --> 05:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
for the record Becky Wilson uh New
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association uh
 
05:27:13.150 --> 05:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to this bill I won't go
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
line by line I'll just sort of Hit the
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
highlights I think of things that we've
 
05:27:19.948 --> 05:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
discussed previously uh in regards to a
 
05:27:23.628 --> 05:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
one-time assessment um qualifying a
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
student to get a diploma um there's some
 
05:27:29.548 --> 05:27:29.558 align:start position:0%
confusion for for us with this bill um
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of using the the Statewide
 
05:27:34.350 --> 05:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
assessment also as the graduation
 
05:27:36.390 --> 05:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
requirement assessment right now the
 
05:27:38.590 --> 05:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
majority of um high schools in New
 
05:27:40.030 --> 05:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public high schools are using
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
the SAT as their Statewide assessment
 
05:27:46.470 --> 05:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's given in 11th grade um this would
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
appeared if you use the bill as written
 
05:27:50.310 --> 05:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
that the student would take the SAT in
 
05:27:52.910 --> 05:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
11th grade and somehow use that to
 
05:27:54.868 --> 05:27:54.878 align:start position:0%
graduate even though they have not been
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
exposed to the curriculum of the 12th
 
05:27:59.868 --> 05:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
grade um and most of the testing is done
 
05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
in October typically of 11th grade to
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
measure 10th grade assessment so I'm a
 
05:28:04.948 --> 05:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
little I think there's a little
 
05:28:07.350 --> 05:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
confusion there in terms of how this how
 
05:28:09.788 --> 05:28:09.798 align:start position:0%
this bill would change our current
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
practice of giving a Statewide
 
05:28:13.750 --> 05:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
assessment for high school um it's not
 
05:28:15.910 --> 05:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
given at every grade uh this committee's
 
05:28:17.708 --> 05:28:17.718 align:start position:0%
also spent an exorbitant amount of time
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
talking about Competency Based education
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
what that means what that looks like um
 
05:28:25.230 --> 05:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
how a student can prove competency uh I
 
05:28:26.990 --> 05:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
think there's been a lot of discussion
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
about the fact that a one-time multiple
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
choice assessment taken on a computer
 
05:28:33.868 --> 05:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily show that a student
 
05:28:35.708 --> 05:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
is competent in the high school
 
05:28:38.350 --> 05:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
competencies that are uh quite honestly
 
05:28:39.948 --> 05:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
derived at the local level and are part
 
05:28:42.310 --> 05:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
of getting a local high school diploma
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
from The Local District uh the Local
 
05:28:45.990 --> 05:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
District should be able to decide what
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
their diploma requirements are um and
 
05:28:51.070 --> 05:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
not base them on a one-time state test
 
05:28:52.590 --> 05:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions for the
 
05:28:55.390 --> 05:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
school boards Association representative
 
05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank you thank you for taking
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
my question and also on assessments
 
05:29:02.230 --> 05:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
parents have the ability to opt out of
 
05:29:04.788 --> 05:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
taking tests thank you for the question
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
yes and this bill does reference that
 
05:29:08.070 --> 05:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
that a parent could opt their child out
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
of taking the Statewide assessment which
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
is an option now as well I'm not sure
 
05:29:14.628 --> 05:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
then what the student would need to do

the Civics test graduation
 
05:32:48.070 --> 05:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
requirement thank you Mr cheer that is
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
true and congratulations for running
 
05:32:52.868 --> 05:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
ahead of schedule that's wonderful to
 
05:32:55.628 --> 05:32:55.638 align:start position:0%
see that when that happens uh for the
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
record uh I'm repr Mike Mett uh M
 
05:33:03.150 --> 05:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
District 4 um canterberry and Lowden so
 
05:33:06.350 --> 05:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
this measure involves RSA 189 colon 11
 
05:33:08.510 --> 05:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 which refers to the required
 
05:33:10.830 --> 05:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
Civics competency assessment which
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
became law last term uh some of you will
 
05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
recall that this graduation requirement
 
05:33:20.230 --> 05:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
mandates all students high school
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
students achieve a 70 or better in the
 
05:33:26.548 --> 05:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
2020 128 question naturalization
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%

05:33:31.270 --> 05:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
States citizen and Immigration
 
05:33:35.070 --> 05:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
Services uh as an aside uh after local
 
05:33:37.430 --> 05:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
districts processed and integrated this
 
05:33:39.070 --> 05:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
requirement over the course of the past
 
05:33:42.590 --> 05:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
year we've received some uh some nice
 
05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotal feedback that the integration
 
05:33:47.670 --> 05:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
of this into the plan seems to be going
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
pretty well and there's actually some
 
05:33:52.470 --> 05:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
excitement believe it or not about this
 
05:33:55.110 --> 05:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
people taking this new um
 
05:33:58.990 --> 05:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
assessment um also anecdotally um just
 
05:34:02.070 --> 05:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday I called my niece uh Malia
 
05:34:04.150 --> 05:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
she's an honor student at conquered High
 
05:34:07.030 --> 05:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
School um but she and my sister-in-law
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
meta just moved back to New Hampshire
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
from Denmark last year so I asked my
 
05:34:13.750 --> 05:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
niece about this Civics requirement
 
05:34:15.510 --> 05:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
which I had some interested in and she
 
05:34:18.110 --> 05:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
said she just started a civics class
 
05:34:20.270 --> 05:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
here in conquer and that she had not
 
05:34:21.788 --> 05:34:21.798 align:start position:0%
taken the test yet but that she was
 
05:34:24.030 --> 05:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
looking forward to it or so she said to
 
05:34:26.310 --> 05:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
me maybe she just was saying that but I
 
05:34:29.270 --> 05:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
she she's a honor student so anyway uh I
 
05:34:31.070 --> 05:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
I of course was interested I asked if
 
05:34:33.628 --> 05:34:33.638 align:start position:0%
there was much feedback uh from her
 
05:34:36.868 --> 05:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
classmates and she said she didn't sense
 
05:34:41.110 --> 05:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
any uh issues um and I pointed out that
 
05:34:44.110 --> 05:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
I was the original sponsor so they can
 
05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
extend credit or blame to me what
 
05:34:48.910 --> 05:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
whatever so anyway I know this committee
 
05:34:51.948 --> 05:34:51.958 align:start position:0%
does a lot of bills um and most of them
 
05:34:54.110 --> 05:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily get into pedagogy or
 
05:34:57.310 --> 05:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
learning uh but this this law does and
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
so with this new Universal requirement
 
05:35:02.708 --> 05:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
every New Hampshire high school graduate
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
is pretty much guaranteed now to have
 
05:35:08.788 --> 05:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
that solid foundation of basic Civics
 
05:35:11.628 --> 05:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
and history fundamentals that was often
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
lacking in in some districts before this
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
law was passed so anyway this creates a
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
new source I think we think of Pride and
 
05:35:22.590 --> 05:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
accomplishment while enhancing the value
 
05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
of a New Hampshire high school
 
05:35:27.548 --> 05:35:27.558 align:start position:0%
diploma and increasing confidence in and
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
support for our schools so uh we
 
05:35:33.190 --> 05:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
submitted this measure 1682 at the
 
05:35:36.150 --> 05:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
request of Department of Education which
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
sought some shank some sanction for the
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
Department for doe to develop a
 
05:35:43.110 --> 05:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
digitized version for the greater
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
convenience of all the schools and
 
05:35:47.548 --> 05:35:47.558 align:start position:0%
school districts uh Dr Nate green is
 
05:35:50.030 --> 05:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
here as well and I'm sure he can also
 
05:35:53.390 --> 05:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
help to answer some questions about this
 
05:35:55.030 --> 05:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's kind of like a housekeeping
 
05:35:56.230 --> 05:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
measure but I know there's a couple
 
05:35:57.628 --> 05:35:57.638 align:start position:0%
pieces of it that you may have some
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions on and I'll try to be happy to
 
05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions if if there
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
are any are there questions from the
 
05:36:08.670 --> 05:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
05:36:11.230 --> 05:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
question maybe folks who were involved
 
05:36:15.948 --> 05:36:15.958 align:start position:0%
in this previously know what I don't
 
05:36:18.150 --> 05:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
know I'm a little surprised that it's
 
05:36:20.548 --> 05:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
not digital already how is the test
 
05:36:23.430 --> 05:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
administered now sure thank you for the
 
05:36:26.310 --> 05:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:36:28.948 --> 05:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
that requirement that is now are is
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
being met a little bit differently I
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
think from um District to District
 
05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
school to school which is why this
 
05:36:38.310 --> 05:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
measure would help to create a a a
 
05:36:40.830 --> 05:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
common version um I'm going to read you
 
05:36:44.030 --> 05:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
if I could um a message that I received
 
05:36:48.150 --> 05:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
from Dr Green who was here copy to Diana
 
05:36:51.310 --> 05:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
Fenton uh because I had when they asked
 
05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
to put this in for the digitized version
 
05:36:57.548 --> 05:36:57.558 align:start position:0%
I had some I had some questions too so
 
05:36:59.948 --> 05:36:59.958 align:start position:0%
uh from Dr Green and he's here as well
 
05:37:02.070 --> 05:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
um the request for a digital version of
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
the test was made in order to have a
 
05:37:06.910 --> 05:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
consistent measure for all teachers to
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
use currently to your excellent question
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
um teachers are giving the test to their
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
students in a variety of different ways
 
05:37:18.510 --> 05:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
or modifying it in various ways since
 
05:37:20.868 --> 05:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
the federal version of the test is given
 
05:37:23.708 --> 05:37:23.718 align:start position:0%
orally those of you who are when the
 
05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
this committee a couple years ago
 
05:37:27.910 --> 05:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
remember that uh the federal version of
 
05:37:29.788 --> 05:37:29.798 align:start position:0%
test to immigrants and and people people
 
05:37:31.470 --> 05:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
trying to become citizens it's given to
 
05:37:33.310 --> 05:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
them Orly they pick out like 10
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions and they have to get six right
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
for our students we uh have in statute
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
that they have to take uh all 128
 
05:37:44.670 --> 05:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
questions and study all 128
 
05:37:44.680 --> 05:37:46.350 align:start position:0%
questions and study all 128
questions

05:37:46.350 --> 05:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so it's not possible to use that
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
approach of giving the test orally uh
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
with 128 questions from a Time
 
05:37:57.868 --> 05:37:57.878 align:start position:0%
perspective the accommodations and
 
05:38:00.830 --> 05:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
modifications in the statute were there
 
05:38:04.110 --> 05:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
so that schools could modify their local
 
05:38:06.548 --> 05:38:06.558 align:start position:0%
assessment uh when we put this into
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
statute we we I specifically uh made
 
05:38:13.510 --> 05:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions for IEPs so that um students
 
05:38:16.990 --> 05:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
could with IEPs could have uh the exam
 
05:38:18.390 --> 05:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
the assessment administered in
 
05:38:19.990 --> 05:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
accordance with their
 
05:38:22.510 --> 05:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
IEPs uh so back to Dr Green those
 
05:38:24.270 --> 05:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
accommodations are all built into the
 
05:38:26.310 --> 05:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
state's assessment system so there is no
 
05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
need for schools to create the
 
05:38:30.110 --> 05:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
accommodations anymore since they will
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
be in the system and tied directly to a
 
05:38:33.320 --> 05:38:34.548 align:start position:0%
be in the system and tied directly to a
student's

05:38:34.548 --> 05:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
student's
 
05:38:38.230 --> 05:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
IEP and finally regarding the fiscal
 
05:38:41.110 --> 05:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
note again this is from Dr Green I do
 
05:38:42.548 --> 05:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
not believe there would be a fiscal
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
impact locally the same teachers that
 
05:38:46.548 --> 05:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
were giving the test previously will
 
05:38:48.270 --> 05:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
likely be the same teachers that will be
 
05:38:50.990 --> 05:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
administering the digital version of the
 
05:38:53.110 --> 05:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
test let me know if you'd like to meet
 
05:38:55.230 --> 05:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
to discuss any of these points prior to
 
05:38:58.110 --> 05:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
the bill becoming in bill being
 
05:39:00.310 --> 05:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
introduced in committee so
 
05:39:02.910 --> 05:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh I I emailed Dr Green he's here as
 
05:39:05.430 --> 05:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
I've said three times um and hopefully
 
05:39:06.670 --> 05:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat further questions from the
 
05:39:13.350 --> 05:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
committee representa cordelli uh thank
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you for being here
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Moffet so really the
 
05:39:19.750 --> 05:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's two main things in here one that
 
05:39:22.350 --> 05:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's a digital common digital
 
05:39:26.150 --> 05:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
assessment um and secondly um removing
 
05:39:30.468 --> 05:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
the uh local um option
 
05:39:33.430 --> 05:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes uh you can see
 
05:39:38.070 --> 05:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
what's been crossed out um in the in the
 
05:39:40.670 --> 05:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
stat in the U bill as
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
introduced um
 
05:39:47.190 --> 05:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm GNA defer to Dr Green if he's
 
05:39:49.628 --> 05:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
still here and yes yes he is thank
 
05:39:52.110 --> 05:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
goodness uh I I'll defer to him I I
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
think he he could answer that better and
 
05:39:57.030 --> 05:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
he's right here F further questions from
 
05:39:59.830 --> 05:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Miler yeah
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh just as an aside I'm surprised that
 
05:40:06.030 --> 05:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
you didn't put in an amendment here that
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
would mandate that anybody who runs for
 
05:40:11.150 --> 05:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
office should pass this test thank you
 
05:40:13.310 --> 05:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
represent my believe it or not and I
 
05:40:14.868 --> 05:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
know you believe it that has come up
 
05:40:17.070 --> 05:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
numerous times that we should take that
 
05:40:19.230 --> 05:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
exam and I support that but that's just
 
05:40:19.240 --> 05:40:21.230 align:start position:0%
exam and I support that but that's just
me

05:40:21.230 --> 05:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to do though is
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to put a bill in so members
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
of this committee can get paid a stien
 
05:40:28.750 --> 05:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund perhaps
 
05:40:31.948 --> 05:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
third 3% to 4% of the annual in interest
 
05:40:33.390 --> 05:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be
 
05:40:35.548 --> 05:40:35.558 align:start position:0%
great I've also heard it said that we
 
05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
should take a competency test
 
05:40:40.110 --> 05:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
too that's that's if you're running for
 
05:40:42.548 --> 05:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
president I think further question I do
 
05:40:45.310 --> 05:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
have one on on this though
 
05:40:48.390 --> 05:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
um the this comes underneath the section
 
05:40:50.270 --> 05:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm not objecting to this test at
 
05:40:55.390 --> 05:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
all I think it's good but are we
 
05:40:59.390 --> 05:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
communicating to the public that this is
 
05:41:02.270 --> 05:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
being used as a digital
 
05:41:06.750 --> 05:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
assessment of the teaching of History
 
05:41:08.788 --> 05:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire history because we talk
 
05:41:10.230 --> 05:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
history and government of the United
 
05:41:14.350 --> 05:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
States and New Hampshire does the test
 
05:41:16.350 --> 05:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
you're referencing here the immigration
 
05:41:18.910 --> 05:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
test All Those Questions reference any
 
05:41:21.468 --> 05:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
history for New Hampshire thank you for
 
05:41:22.750 --> 05:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
the question with regard to the
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
immigration test referencing history if
 
05:41:27.030 --> 05:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
you look at the 128 questions that a lot
 
05:41:29.270 --> 05:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
of them are with regard to government
 
05:41:32.110 --> 05:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
structure uh a lot of them are about
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
history and the beauty of this is that
 
05:41:38.070 --> 05:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh students have it's like a driver's
 
05:41:39.948 --> 05:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
test in a sense you know you get a a
 
05:41:41.868 --> 05:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
manual that you need to study to get a
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
driver's license and here it's driver's
 
05:41:46.948 --> 05:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
licenses you teach to the test so to
 
05:41:49.310 --> 05:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
speak and the body of knowledge here the
 
05:41:52.030 --> 05:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
128 questions does include a lot of
 
05:41:56.430 --> 05:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
history so any student or every student
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
who needs to pass this exam needs to be
 
05:42:03.230 --> 05:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with and study the uh the body
 
05:42:05.350 --> 05:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
of information body of knowledge that is
 
05:42:07.468 --> 05:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
included in 128 questions so yes there
 
05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
is a lot of history in there US History
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire history specifically
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay that was my concern that
 
05:42:22.468 --> 05:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
I Is it wise that we well I won't I
 
05:42:26.350 --> 05:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
won't start that way a sucess digital
 
05:42:28.910 --> 05:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
assessment of the parentheses history
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
and government up top it talks about New
 
05:42:35.270 --> 05:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've looked at it and I
 
05:42:36.350 --> 05:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a whole lot of New
 
05:42:38.788 --> 05:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history yes there's a lot of
 
05:42:40.830 --> 05:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
continuity between our Constitution and
 
05:42:43.310 --> 05:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
the Constitution of the United
 
05:42:45.628 --> 05:42:45.638 align:start position:0%
States uh it's funny to mention that Mr
 
05:42:47.468 --> 05:42:47.478 align:start position:0%
chairman I happen to be on a Civics
 
05:42:50.430 --> 05:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
commission that has been tasked with uh
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh addressing that very uh situation of
 
05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
developing a uh you know some Civics
 
05:43:00.270 --> 05:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in in a textbook for uh
 
05:43:02.910 --> 05:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that that uh I I assure
 
05:43:04.670 --> 05:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
you is in the works uh with this
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
commission I sit on that commission too
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
I knew that and we have a meeting on
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the 7th
 
05:43:14.070 --> 05:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
yes you're meeting on Wednesday
 
05:43:17.750 --> 05:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yes represent myy thank you did I
 
05:43:17.760 --> 05:43:18.750 align:start position:0%
yeah yes represent myy thank you did I
hear

05:43:18.750 --> 05:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
hear
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
incorrectly that there was a new name
 
05:43:23.468 --> 05:43:23.478 align:start position:0%
for this
 
05:43:26.110 --> 05:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
test uh the question was is is there a
 
05:43:28.548 --> 05:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
new name for this test uh not that I'm
 
05:43:33.670 --> 05:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
aware of the the uh assessment is the U
 
05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
the 128 question 2020 version of the
 
05:43:42.590 --> 05:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
United States um it's in
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
the um I I only rise that because as
 
05:43:47.430 --> 05:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
long as you're dealing with the bill if
 
05:43:50.788 --> 05:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
there is a new name for it we should
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
probably put that in this particular
 
05:43:55.390 --> 05:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
bill but I I I heard that yeah I heard
 
05:43:57.468 --> 05:43:57.478 align:start position:0%
that from a teacher I think that said
 
05:43:58.750 --> 05:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
well we don't have to do that now
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
because because they're not doing that
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
test anymore they've got a new test now
 
05:44:05.868 --> 05:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
it's not in the not in the law sure that
 
05:44:08.190 --> 05:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
type of confusion is is a concern that's
 
05:44:10.590 --> 05:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
why in statute we specifically said this
 
05:44:15.150 --> 05:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
is the 128 version 20 128 question 2020
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
version since 2020 they've gone back to
 
05:44:21.030 --> 05:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
the 100 question version uh so that's
 
05:44:23.030 --> 05:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
part perhaps why there's some some
 
05:44:26.270 --> 05:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
confusion because uh they they went from
 
05:44:28.910 --> 05:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
100 was 100 questions it went up to 128
 
05:44:30.990 --> 05:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
and nowc back to 100 so we specifically
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
wanted the more rigorous there's more
 
05:44:36.310 --> 05:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge in the 128 question version to
 
05:44:39.150 --> 05:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
study so that specifically is in statute
 
05:44:41.548 --> 05:44:41.558 align:start position:0%
is the assessment that the schools are
 
05:44:45.628 --> 05:44:45.638 align:start position:0%
expected to uh uh administer further
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
05:44:50.948 --> 05:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:44:56.390 --> 05:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:01.548 --> 05:45:01.558 align:start position:0%
this Dr Green okay just hoping you
 
05:45:03.990 --> 05:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
step we'll need a pink card when you
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:10.510 --> 05:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
yes if I
 
05:45:13.430 --> 05:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
may my my question is a simple one uh
 
05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett said that the the
 
05:45:19.628 --> 05:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
new assessment system uh automatically
 
05:45:21.750 --> 05:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
provides Provisions for persons with
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities Etc uh can you clarify that
 
05:45:27.628 --> 05:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
a little bit since we've now eliminated
 
05:45:32.990 --> 05:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
that one line 14- 19 from the proposed
 
05:45:35.830 --> 05:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah so specifically in the
 
05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
statute it had said schools are required
 
05:45:41.310 --> 05:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
to provide accommodations and may modify
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
the Naturalization Examination for a
 
05:45:44.910 --> 05:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
child with a disability and that was in
 
05:45:46.390 --> 05:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
there previously because the schools
 
05:45:49.230 --> 05:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
themselves were creating the test and so
 
05:45:51.310 --> 05:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
not knowing what format that test might
 
05:45:52.670 --> 05:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
be in the only person that would be able
 
05:45:54.548 --> 05:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
to modify the test would have been the
 
05:45:55.948 --> 05:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
school district in accordance with
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
students I AP under the Statewide
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
assessment system we have a a whole host
 
05:46:03.390 --> 05:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
of accommodations that are built into
 
05:46:05.390 --> 05:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
the system that are matched to students
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
IPS so schools now would no longer be
 
05:46:10.190 --> 05:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
required to modify the test they just
 
05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that the
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
accommodations are in the students IEP
 
05:46:14.750 --> 05:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
so when the student goes in to take the
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
test those accommodations now will be
 
05:46:19.110 --> 05:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
automatically applied um and that's
 
05:46:20.230 --> 05:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
because the test itself would be
 
05:46:21.910 --> 05:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
standardized within the state assessment
 
05:46:24.548 --> 05:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
system if I may yes what kind of
 
05:46:26.910 --> 05:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
accommodations are we talking about uh
 
05:46:27.948 --> 05:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
so there could be a variety of
 
05:46:29.948 --> 05:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
accommodations um some things are as
 
05:46:31.868 --> 05:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
simple as allowing a student extra time
 
05:46:33.708 --> 05:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
if you have a time test uh if you have a
 
05:46:36.270 --> 05:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
student that has a particular uh Vision
 
05:46:38.230 --> 05:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
impairment there are ways for the system
 
05:46:40.670 --> 05:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
to create larger font uh to create more
 
05:46:43.150 --> 05:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
contrasted font by changing the colors
 
05:46:44.670 --> 05:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
of the text or the background of the
 
05:46:46.990 --> 05:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
screen uh we have text to speeech
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
accommodations which are software
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
programs that will read text out loud to
 
05:46:53.708 --> 05:46:53.718 align:start position:0%
students um so it really depends on the
 
05:46:55.510 --> 05:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
particular disabilities are identified
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
in the students's
 
05:47:01.468 --> 05:47:01.478 align:start position:0%
IEP further questions yes represent
 
05:47:05.270 --> 05:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you Dr Green um uh I I
 
05:47:08.430 --> 05:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
think I um was in correct um previously
 
05:47:11.150 --> 05:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
when I said it eliminates the um local
 
05:47:13.590 --> 05:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
assessment requirement
 
05:47:17.830 --> 05:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
um but I I'm was a little confused about
 
05:47:20.190 --> 05:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
the uh getting rid of the um local
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
accommodations because um it seems like
 
05:47:27.310 --> 05:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
on lines um two three and four and then
 
05:47:31.190 --> 05:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
again in 10 there is a local assessment
 
05:47:36.510 --> 05:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
options so if and on lines 10 it seems
 
05:47:39.910 --> 05:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
that a local assessment and the US
 
05:47:43.190 --> 05:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
citizenship test are required so
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the district be able to do
 
05:47:48.510 --> 05:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
accommodations on the local assessment
 
05:47:50.868 --> 05:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
that they develop yeah so special
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
education um is both a state requirement
 
05:47:55.350 --> 05:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
and a federal requirement so schools
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
required under federal law to provide
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
the accommodations identified in student
 
05:48:01.670 --> 05:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
IEP so if we didn't call it out at all
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
within this statute a school would still
 
05:48:07.070 --> 05:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
be required to follow that child's IEP
 
05:48:08.468 --> 05:48:08.478 align:start position:0%
um we had just removed it from that
 
05:48:09.948 --> 05:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
sentence because it had referred
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
specifically to the Naturalization exam
 
05:48:14.670 --> 05:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
um but it would regardless of whether
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the USCIS test or
 
05:48:18.910 --> 05:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
the locally sanctioned competency
 
05:48:21.230 --> 05:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
assessment uh school would be required
 
05:48:23.230 --> 05:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
to provide students with
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
accommodations go ahead um thank you
 
05:48:28.590 --> 05:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
just to follow up to representative
 
05:48:30.830 --> 05:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
Myer's question do you know anything
 
05:48:34.468 --> 05:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
about a new name for that test no I
 
05:48:35.788 --> 05:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
believe that that's probably in
 
05:48:37.948 --> 05:48:37.958 align:start position:0%
reference to the newer version of the
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
USCIS test um the 2020 version was the
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
128 question it's now reverted back to
 
05:48:47.670 --> 05:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh a previous version that's now 100
 
05:48:49.548 --> 05:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
questions um and actually if I could
 
05:48:51.230 --> 05:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
just uh respond maybe a little bit to a
 
05:48:53.070 --> 05:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
question that uh chairman lad had asked
 
05:48:54.390 --> 05:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
earlier regarding the New Hampshire
 
05:48:56.430 --> 05:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
history I think one of the reasons that
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
both the uh local competency assessment
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
and the Naturalization exam we in the
 
05:49:02.948 --> 05:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
statute is that local competency
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
assessment is where you find much of the
 
05:49:07.310 --> 05:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based history um because
 
05:49:09.750 --> 05:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
it isn't reflected in the USCIS test
 
05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
which is more focused on United States
 
05:49:13.030 --> 05:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
government and
 
05:49:15.150 --> 05:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
structure yeah and I have one other
 
05:49:17.788 --> 05:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
question that's not linked to that but
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
um is there a specific time that with
 
05:49:22.430 --> 05:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessments we do that in
 
05:49:25.430 --> 05:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
Spring um can this be given to a high
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
school student anywhere along their
 
05:49:30.510 --> 05:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
pathway or is it Min if it's going
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
digital now are you going to request
 
05:49:35.070 --> 05:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
that it be done at a certain time so
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
there are two things that we've looked
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
at because currently we only use the
 
05:49:39.948 --> 05:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment at the high school
 
05:49:42.310 --> 05:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
level for juniors um so right now we
 
05:49:44.030 --> 05:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't have freshman sophomore and
 
05:49:45.948 --> 05:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
seniors that are routinely rostered into
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
our system we do have information on
 
05:49:49.350 --> 05:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
seniors because they would have taken
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
the state test the previous year when
 
05:49:53.868 --> 05:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
they were Juniors um so in building this
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
digitized version of the assessment
 
05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
we've asked for two specific
 
05:49:59.150 --> 05:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
specifications that would be that the
 
05:50:01.948 --> 05:50:01.958 align:start position:0%
rostering system is uh encompassing of
 
05:50:04.390 --> 05:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
all high school grades so all students 9
 
05:50:07.110 --> 05:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
through 12 would have access to the test
 
05:50:08.990 --> 05:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and then the test window itself would
 
05:50:12.468 --> 05:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
be open um probably if not the full
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
school year but even a little bit into
 
05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
the summer particularly given that this
 
05:50:18.510 --> 05:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
is a graduation requirement you may have
 
05:50:20.548 --> 05:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
students that are completing some of
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
their graduation requirements as they
 
05:50:23.948 --> 05:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
going into summer and may even need a
 
05:50:25.590 --> 05:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of time at the beginning of
 
05:50:26.990 --> 05:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
Summer to fulfill some of their
 
05:50:28.910 --> 05:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
requirements um and we know there are
 
05:50:30.468 --> 05:50:30.478 align:start position:0%
districts that routinely have summer
 
05:50:32.590 --> 05:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
graduations um for students that maybe
 
05:50:33.990 --> 05:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
have a half a credit that they're still
 
05:50:36.030 --> 05:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
completing or you know they're missing a
 
05:50:37.990 --> 05:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
credit on their transcript or if there's
 
05:50:39.948 --> 05:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
something uh like this where the test
 
05:50:41.350 --> 05:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
itself is a graduation requirement and
 
05:50:43.750 --> 05:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
they haven't taken it yet and who in
 
05:50:45.830 --> 05:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
supervises the administration of this
 
05:50:48.390 --> 05:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
test so that Johnny Smith doesn't have
 
05:50:51.350 --> 05:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
David Hall do the test for him so with
 
05:50:52.990 --> 05:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
the state assessment usually it's
 
05:50:54.788 --> 05:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
coordinated with school counselors and
 
05:50:56.750 --> 05:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
often times the math and the ELA
 
05:50:58.468 --> 05:50:58.478 align:start position:0%
teachers of the high school uh because
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
current state assessment is uh focus on
 
05:51:03.430 --> 05:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
math Ela uh and then
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
science excuse me um so likely would be
 
05:51:08.430 --> 05:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh similar Personnel uh people that are
 
05:51:10.390 --> 05:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
involved with social studies programs at
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
the high school uh in coordination with
 
05:51:14.310 --> 05:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh building principal and school
 
05:51:17.070 --> 05:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
counselors thank you further
 
05:51:20.310 --> 05:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
05:51:21.948 --> 05:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
any other pink cards on the senator do
 
05:51:23.190 --> 05:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
you have anything to
 
05:51:26.830 --> 05:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
say no
 
05:51:29.310 --> 05:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
good anything else
 
05:51:32.350 --> 05:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we will close this
 
05:51:39.430 --> 05:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
day check mark
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
some oh yeah yeah
 
05:51:49.590 --> 05:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:49.600 --> 05:51:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
card

05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:04.830 --> 05:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:09.230 --> 05:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
these I don't know see I I think that on
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:27.240 --> 05:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
